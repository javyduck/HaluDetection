{"document":"David Cameron is narrowly winning the battle for floating voters, according to a major poll out today. The ComRes survey of 4,000 undecided voters found a slim majority have been more impressed with the performance of the Prime Minister than that of Ed Miliband during the Election campaign. A separate poll of marginal seats by the former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft suggests that Ukip\u2019s vote is being squeezed in key constituencies as election day approaches. A ComRes survey of 4,000 undecided voters across the UK found a slim majority have been more impressed with the performance of Prime Minister David Cameron than that of Ed Miliband during the Election campaign. It also suggests Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is set to hold her marginal seat in Loughborough. Today\u2019s ComRes survey, for ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain show, found that 37 per cent of floating voters have been impressed with Mr Cameron\u2019s performance on the campaign trail so far, compared with 31 per cent who think Mr Miliband has done well. Nigel Farage was just behind on 30 per cent. Meanwhile, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, has impressed 21 per cent of voters on the back of her strong performance in last week\u2019s televised leaders\u2019 debate. Ms Sturgeon appears to have been biting her nails. Is the pressure starting to tell on Nicola Sturgeon? From the look of her hands as she met her party\u2019s candidates in Aberdeen yesterday, it looks like the 44-year-old SNP leader has been struck by a bout of behind-the-scenes finger-chewing. Mr Cameron also suffered less badly from negative appraisals. While 49 per cent said they were \u2018unimpressed\u2019 with the Prime Minister\u2019s performance, 54 per cent said the same of Mr Miliband. But the poll also shows that politicians have yet to shift many of the undecided voters whose support is likely to be critical in next month\u2019s election. Just 12 per cent of the group said they had made up their minds since they were last polled in March. Another 48 per cent said they had a \u2018good idea\u2019 who they would back, while 16 per cent said they were \u2018starting to lean towards a certain party\u2019. Almost a quarter (24 per cent) said they were \u2018completely undecided who to vote for\u2019. Floating voters identified the NHS as the most important issue, followed by immigration, the cost of living and the economy. Meanwhile, Lord Ashcroft\u2019s survey of Labour-Tory marginals suggests Mr Cameron still has a lot of work to do just to hold on to the seats he won in 2010. Of ten Tory-held marginal constituencies, Labour is ahead in four seats, with the parties tied in another. Mr Cameron also suffered less badly from negative appraisals, with 49 per cent of undecided voters saying they were \u2018unimpressed\u2019 with his performance and 54 per cent saying the same of Mr Miliband (pictured) Lord Ashcroft said the study showed Ukip\u2019s vote was being squeezed since the same seats were polled last year. \u2018The Ukip share had fallen significantly \u2013 by up to 10 points \u2013 in nine of the ten seats polled,\u2019 he said. The decline in Ukip support has helped the Tories consolidate their grip in Blackpool North, Pendle, Gloucester, Kingswood and Mrs Morgan\u2019s Leicestershire constituency. The Education Secretary, whose 3,744 majority is the smallest in the Cabinet, is now nine points ahead of the Labour challenger. But Labour also appears to be benefiting from the squeeze in Ukip support in some areas, moving ahead of the Tories in Harrow East and increasing its lead in the Tory-held seats of Hove, Stockton South, and Morecambe and Lunesdale. In Pudsey, West Yorkshire, Labour and the Conservatives were tied with 40 per cent each. Nigel Farage said he was not concerned about the Ashcroft polls, saying: \u2018In areas where the two big parties are firing heavy artillery and we are not, it is perhaps not entirely surprising.\u2019 Ed and Justine Miliband on the campaign trail. Ed Miliband\u2019s wife has revealed how he led her to believe he was single when they met at a dinner party \u2013 at the home of the woman he was dating. Justine Miliband said she was furious to discover he was seeing another woman. She also described how that evening, the future Labour leader bored her by insisting on talking about economics. Mrs Miliband told the Daily Mirror: \u2018I thought he was good looking and clever and seemed to be unattached. But we just went down a conversational cul-de-sac. \u2018Apparently we had nothing in common. He wanted to talk about economics \u2013 one of my least favourite subjects. None of our conversations went anywhere.\u2019 The unpromising start to their relationship was compounded when she found out he had been going out with the woman who invited them to dinner. \u2018I was furious. I bumped in to him a couple of times after that, but we didn\u2019t start seeing each other for at least a year,\u2019 she said. Speaking while she was campaigning in Runcorn, Cheshire this week, Mrs Miliband said: \u2018Canvassing in the rain always reminds me of falling in love with Ed in 2005. \u2018I had never been out leafleting before and didn\u2019t realise you had to keep your eye out for dogs on the other side of the letterbox. \u2018I\u2019d been bitten by a Doberman. Ed bandaged me up and I fell in love with him.\u2019 Labour slammed for 'weaponising child sex abuse in campaign. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper released figures which showed reports of child sex abuse have risen by 60 per cent over the past four years. Labour was last night accused of \u2018weaponising\u2019 child abuse after blaming the Coalition for a rise in child sexual exploitation. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper released figures which showed reports of child sex abuse have risen by 60 per cent over the past four years, while arrests for these offences have fallen by 9 per cent. The Tories said the figures were \u2018false\u2019, and accused Labour of \u2018playing politics\u2019 with an \u2018appalling crime\u2019. They said the rise in reports was due to more awareness of the issue in light of scandals in Labour council areas such as Rochdale and elsewhere. Last night Conservative MP Julian Smith said: \u2018Is there no level to which Labour won\u2019t stoop? First they tried to weaponise the NHS, now this. It\u2019s disgusting.\u2019 Miss Cooper claimed the figures showed police are not able to respond to the scale of the reports, pointing out that over the past four years, almost 17,000 officers have been cut. She added: \u2018[Tory] plans for deeper cuts in the next Parliament cutting over 20,000 police would be deeply damaging to the fight against child abuse.\u2019 A Tory spokesman said: \u2018Child abuse is an appalling crime, and no one should play politics with it. Labour\u2019s conclusions are false. They are talking about the amount of crime that is reported to the police. \u2018But for many people, child sexual abuse has been a hidden crime which is only now coming to light, and it is good that more people are having the courage to come forward. Rather than making up numbers about police officers, Labour should support the action we have taken to expose this evil crime, to prosecute the perpetrators and to support survivors.\u2019\n","right_summary":"Survey of 4,000 undecided voters found slim majority favour Prime Minister. 37% of floating voters impressed with Cameron while 31% with Miliband.

{"document":"There\u2019s nothing better than a succulent steak, sizzling from the hot plate, charred to perfection on the outside, bursting with juices within. People often get it wrong when  cooking this cut of meat and end up with an overdone dish that\u2019s bone dry, grey-hued and distinctly unappetising. So what is the best way to cook the perfect steak? Do you season before or after? Oil the pan or the meat? And what are the best cuts? Scroll down for video. Speak to your butcher when you're shopping for a perfect steak and pay a little bit extra for the best meat. Allow your meat to come to room temperature before you start cooking, Mr McCarroll advised. According to Jared McCarroll head chef at M Restaurant and Grill, the first step to a perfect steak starts when you are shopping; when buying steaks purchase the best meat you can afford. He told Femail: \u2018It\u2019s best to speak to your local butcher and pay a little bit extra and reap the rewards when eating it.\u2019 And while we all stress about the cooking times for steak, he advises in checking the temperature of the meat before you start preparing your meal. 'One of the most important steps in cooking the perfect steak that is often forgotten or never thought about, is to allow your meat to come to room temperature first. 'This will shorten the cooking time and help to prevent grey rings from happening,' Mr McCarroll continued. Your steak should have a fine texture, be well marbled (veins of fat running through the meat) and firm to the touch. The shape and thickness of the steak is also important; the best steaks are one to 1.5-inches thick as a thinner cut is likely to get dry quicker. \u2018The texture will depend on the quality of the beef and the cut; fillet has the best texture but the least flavour, whereas ribeye has more flavour and more fat, less texture but more flavour,' the chef said. \u2018When it comes to the shape of the steak, try and keep it flat and a decent thickness. \u2018Too thin a steak will be easy to overcook. Also try to keep the shape the same throughout the whole steak as this will help to keep the cooking consistent. A rib-eye (pictured) has more fat and more flavour but less texture. Some people like theirs blue while others don\u2019t want to see any pink in their meat. But what are the perfect timings to cook steak the way you like it? If you are unsure, it's best to speak to your butcher as they will be able to give you the best advice based on the thickness and cut of meat. The cooking times below are for a 2cm thick sirloin steak. Blue: 1 minute each side.\u00a0The steak should be just warm and fell spongy under your fingertips. Meat should still be dark in colour. Rare: 1.5 minutes per side.\u00a0Dark red with some juice. There will be some resistance when you press the meat but it should still feel soft and bouncy. Medium rare:  2 minutes per side.\u00a0Pink meat with pink juice. Springy, soft and spongy. Medium: 2.5 \u00a0mins per side. Your meat will be mostly cooked with only pink in the middle. The steak will feel firm. Well-done: 4 to 5 minutes. There will be hardly any pink and the meat should have a bouncy, firm feel. But which cuts are the best? Or do they all have their own strengths? 'The cut depends on individual preference,' he said. 'The most important thing is to look out for marbling. Marbling is a great way to tell the quality of the meat. The more marbling a piece of steak has means the more moist it will be. Marbling means your steak is full of mono saturated fatty acid, proven to reduce cholesterol levels. It also has a low melting point, thus giving you the melt-in-the-mouth effect. When seasoning, Mr McCarroll advises using coarse salt. \u2018When seasoning the beef, I would place the beef on the grill and season the top with a coarse salt; either rock salt or Maldon is good. \u2018The steak will absorb the salt and when you flip it the excess salt will fall off, which means you can season the other side. Cook your steak on a grill and only flip it over once, he said. 'For me the best way to cook a steak is straight on the grill. Charcoal and wood will give you the most flavour and smokiness but if you have a gas BBQ that will do as well. 'Ideally you should only flip your steak once,' he continued. And while we\u2019ve all been told various cooking times for the perfect steak, Mr McCarroll says there are too many variables to have anything set in stone. \u2018Cooking times will vary depending on the size of the steak, whether it is room temperature, how hot your grill is. 'There are too many variables to give a specific cooking time,\u2019 he said. The T-Bone (left) gets its name from the distinctive T-shaped bone. Filet mignons are prized for their tender meat although they are the least flavourful cuts. T-Bone: This cut gets its name from its distinctive T-shaped bone T-shaped bone.

{"document":"He's been at the sharp end of football for the majority of his career but a former Premier League striker seems to have met his match when literally trying his hand at another profession. Preston North End forward Kevin Davies has been through the wars during his 22 years in the beautiful game - being bumped and bruised by many an opposition defence. The 38-year-old isn't adverse to putting the boot in himself though -proven by the fact that he formerly held the record for the most Premier League bookings by a player with 99, alongside Lee Bowyer, before Everton midfielder Gareth Barry took that unwanted stat this season.

It's the second time in less than two months where Preston's No 9 has injured that part of his body.

{"document":"In baseball, there's a traditional comeback after a tough season: \"Wait 'til next year!\" For climate change \"next year\" is now. This year is the time and the United Nations' international climate negotiations in Paris in December are the place to secure strong global agreement to curb heat-trapping emissions. A successful climate pact will send a signal around the world that a shift to a low-carbon economy is underway. The United States has made clear that it is ready to step up to the plate on climate change. The U.S. administration on Tuesday unveiled details about its proposal to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.  This common-sense and achievable plan to decarbonize the U.S. economy will result in significant cost savings from cleaner technologies and create more American energy jobs to power our homes and businesses. This is an area where the United States needs to lead, and doing so will create a better planet for our children and a more prosperous future for our country. The United States isn't alone in this global climate effort. In a landmark joint announcement with the United States in November, China unveiled its intent to peak its carbon emissions around 2030 and to double its share of zero-carbon energy to 20%. This shift will require substantial effort from China to retool its economy, increase investment in renewable energy and divest from coal. As the world's No. 1 investor in renewable energy, China has already taken important steps forward. At the same time, India has set the audacious goal of installing 100 gigawatts of solar power capacity by 2022, a 30-fold increase from current levels and eight times more solar capacity than the United States has today. Cities and corporations are joining in as well. More than 200 cities, home to 436 million people, have voluntarily committed to saving 13 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury. And more than a thousand companies, along with 73 countries, voiced support for putting a price on carbon and moving to cleaner energy technologies. Leading companies, like Apple and Google, are making major bets on renewable energy. And another 25 businesses have signed onto the Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers' Principles\u2014these companies represent energy demand equal to more than 1 million homes. Increasing examples demonstrate that strong climate action can be good for the economy. For instance, renewable sources now provide one-fifth of the world's electricity, while solar manufacturing costs have dropped 80% in the last seven years. Wind turbines installed now are 100 times better at generating power than turbines were 30 years ago. Clean technology investments surged to $310 billion last year. In the United States, carbon emissions fell by 10% from 2007 to 2013, the largest absolute emissions reduction recorded, even as the United States has recovered from the Great Recession. Many of these shifts are unprecedented and could not have been anticipated even five years ago. Yet these trends alone are not enough to counter the mounting climate-related impacts that we are already seeing. A global climate agreement in Paris this December can send more signals to markets and drive more ambitious climate action for decades to come. A Paris agreement would represent a new form of international cooperation and a fundamental change in the global approach to climate action \u2014 a shift from burden-sharing to the creation of mutual opportunities; from cost to investment; from economic threat to a spur to economic development. With the United States showing the way, and with cooperation from other countries, businesses, investors, cities and citizens, we can achieve a prosperous and secure future for all. Each year, baseball returns and hope springs eternal. Now, it's time for all countries to get in the game.\n","right_summary":"Bill Richardson: U.S  announced plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.

In summer, you can chill it in the fridge for a few hours to keep you cool throughout the night. It also soothes stiff muscles \u2014 as the chill will reduce inflammation and help numb any pain. It doesn\u2019t look impressive, but it shapes beautifully around my shoulders and neck. It makes a slight rustling as the tiny hulls shift, but I had a great night\u2019s sleep. All I needed was Mark Rylance beside me, and my dream would have been complete. 4\/5. MARRIAGE SAVERS. Reversible Foam Pillow, \u00a335,\u00a0marksandspencer.com. I\u2019ve had some spectacular rows over pillows. My husband, Ray, likes a firmer pillow, while I like a lovely soft one, but I hate buying different types as we inevitably get them mixed up and we both have a bad night. Can M&S solve the dilemma with this unique two-sided pillow? One side \u2014 made from a very firm memory foam \u2014 suits Ray perfectly, but is far too rigid for me. The other side, made from synthetic microfibre filling, is perfectly soft and squishy. At 6in thick, it\u2019s a little higher than some we tried, but this clever pillow still gave me a good night\u2019s sleep. We both woke up happy, and that\u2019s good enough for me! 4\/5. A SMELLY SNOOZE. Silent Night Febreze Pillow, \u00a39.99, argos.co.uk. I was hoping for the soft scent of lavender gently lulling me to sleep, but instead I got a rather sickly synthetic pong wafting up from the filling. Definitely more lavatory than lavender. The lightweight pillow made of polyester didn\u2019t improve my sleep any more than any other ones I tried. Synthetic fillings are the most popular type of pillows in the UK, because they are cheap. But let\u2019s face it, if I wanted the scent of Febreze at bedtime, I\u2019d be better off spraying Ray as he lay beside me snoring. At 3.5in thick, it is soft but offers little support, and I woke feeling uncomfortable and grumpy. 1\/5. SO SOFT. . . AND CHEAP! Lidl Microfibre Pillows, \u00a33.49, Lidl. Budget pillows tend to be thin, bounce-free and crackling with static electricity. So I was delighted to find these bargain-basement microfibre-filled pillows are generously stuffed and incredibly silky to touch. Because they are filled with bundles of ultra-fine synthetic fibre, the pillows are wonderfully soft. My 16-year-old daughter, Ruby, the fussiest sleeper since the princess and the pea, declared it the best pillow she had ever tried. A similar synthetic pillow from John Lewis would set me back \u00a335, which makes this \u2014 at under a fiver \u2014 a total winner. Synthetic pillows have the shortest lifespan of all \u2014 from six months to two years before they flatten or fall out of shape \u2014 but at this price, who cares. This pillow is just under 4in thick, but flattens due to the synthetic filling, so if you prefer height you\u2019ll need two. 5\/5. WHEEZE-FREE SLEEP. Sleepangel Memory Foam Filter Pillow, \u00a359, sleepangelworld.com. More dust mites live in the bedroom than anywhere else in the house \u2014 and they make a beeline for warm bedding. This anti-allergy pillow contains a four-layer filter designed to block germs, bacteria, mould and allergens. The waterproof, wipe-clean cover is heat-sealed, with no seams or needle marks to let in germs. It sounds impressive, but to test the effectiveness I used a pillow for three months before sending it to an independent laboratory. Scientists took samples of the foam filling and confirmed it was completely free of any nasties. With a 13-year-old son who suffers from asthma \u2014 a condition often triggered by mould and dust mites \u2014 this was reassuring. It is 3.5in thick, with little give thanks to the memory foam filling. The price tag is hefty, but totally worth it for a wheeze-free son. I\u2019ve passed this on to Charlie for an unbroken night of sleep. 4\/5. MUSIC TO MY EARS. Sound Asleep Pillow, \u00a317.99 firebox.com. Since my three children became teenagers, the task of persuading them to go to bed at night has become my worst nightmare. Could this high-tech pillow \u2014 wired for sound as they plug in their iPods to the external lead which connects to a speaker hidden inside \u2014 work miracles? Certainly, it\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve ever seen them excited about going to bed, and I was stunned to see my son Archie jump in before I\u2019d issued a single threat. But the sort of music I hear thumping out of his pillow minutes later isn\u2019t exactly restful! Luckily, the pillow muffles the sound for the rest of us. The pillow is not very thick (at 3in deep) or supportive. A winner for anyone aged 13-19 and for parents who are desperate for peace and quiet! 3\/5. THE GOLDEN GOOSE. Hungarian Goose Down Pillow, \u00a388 For Two, soakandsleep.com. Down pillows are the softest and most luxurious type available and often come with a price tag to match. These ones are made by a small family firm in Hungary. The filling is washed in thermal spring water \u2014 so there are no nasty chemicals involved. Each pillow is double-stitched for strength and edged with gold piping for luxury you\u2019ve never seen outside a five-star hotel. No wonder these pillows have amassed their own online following \u2014 as well as demand from top hotels around the world. Feels like sleeping on a giant marshmallow \u2014 it really is a luxury treat. Just one sumptuous pillow, measuring 5in thick \u2014 was enough for a perfect night\u2019s sleep. 5\/5. LIKE SLEEPING ON A SPACE HOPPER. Mediflow Waterbase Pillow, \u00a339.99, amazon.co.uk. Water pillows are fast becoming a trend \u2014 to keep cool or help sore necks and shoulders. They contain a pouch that you fill with water by opening the rubber seal, and pouring your water in. This means you can actually choose the height of your own pillow, depending on how you sleep best. My first attempt at filling it goes wrong. I pour so much water inside that it feels like I\u2019m sleeping on a Space Hopper. A thermal insulator keeps the water cool, while an anti-allergy cushion of polyester fibres surround the inner water chamber, making it look and feel like any other pillow. The first night didn\u2019t go well, as my neck felt too high. But I simply let water out the next day, taking the pillow from 5in thick to 3in, and I slept like a baby. 3\/5. WOOLLY WONDER. Fogarty Wool Pillow, \u00a324.99, dunelm-mill.com. Wool is nature\u2019s best temperature regulator \u2014 staying cool in summer and warm in winter. But can a pillow stuffed with wiry wool instead of lovely bouncy feathers offer as much comfort? The answer is yes. As I sink into the warm pillow I feel instantly comforted. Wool naturally absorbs moisture and scientists say the average sleeper gives off nearly a pint of water vapour. If you suffer from menopausal night sweats, this can rise to well over that. Once absorbed, the moisture quickly evaporates from the porous wool cells, so what looks like a normal pillow is actually a natural air conditioning unit. at 3in thick, this pillow is thinner and has less give, but it supported my sore neck \u2014 strained as I walked the dog \u2014 well. I slept well and woke feeling cool and refreshed. 3\/5.\n","right_summary":"Does finding the perfect pillow really need to break the bank?

{"document":"A union plumber, a school teacher and a survivor of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre were among the 19 women and five men chosen to serve as jurors in the death penalty trial of Colorado theater shooter James Holmes. The 12 jurors and 12 alternates were chosen on Tuesday in in Arapahoe County District Court after a selection process that began on January 20, and which experts said was among the largest and most complicated in U.S. history. Holmes is charged with shooting dead 12 people and wounding 70 others in the July 2012 attack at a Century movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a midnight screening of the film The Dark Knight Rises. Aurora theater shooting suspect James Holmes (pictured on June 4, 2013) is seated in court in Centennial, Colorado. Jury selection in the Colorado theater shooting case entered its final stage on Monday. Police and residents visit the makeshift memorial at the scene of the Aurora movie theater massacre in Colorado in July 2012. His attorneys don't dispute that he pulled the trigger but say he was in the grips of a psychotic episode when he slipped into the packed movie theater and opened fire. Jurors will decide whether he was legally insane at the time. If they find him guilty, they must also decide whether he should be put to death or sentenced to life in prison without parole. THE JURORS. All 24 jurors - 19 women and five men - will sit through the entire trial. Neither the group nor the public will know who is a primary juror and who is an alternate until the case is handed over for deliberations. Also on the jury are a Denver Public Schools employee, a person with depression and a businesswoman who cares for her elderly parents. A lawyer, a gas station attendant, a military veteran and an active-duty service member were also selected, according to The Denver Post. The Post also reported that one female juror selected was a plumber who was diagnosed with ADHD. She said during the selection process that she knew what it was like 'to be a little bit different'. Another female juror said her daughter had gone to see the Batman movie on the same night as the shooting but at a different theater. One juror said during questioning, before she was chosen, that she was nervous what her community would think of her verdict. The case is 'big and serious, and it's going to have a huge impact on me and everyone else, the defendant and people in the community,' she said. 'They're not going to be directly involved, but they're going to be watching.' LINE OF QUESTIONING. Attorneys on Tuesday questioned the 93 remaining jurors about their interpretations of the law, how they would gauge witnesses' and experts' credibility, and whether they could handle serving on such a high-profile trial. District Attorney George Brauchler characterized it as a 'four- to five-month roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine'. He asked prospective jurors if they could serve even if they hear no evidence of a motive, since prosecutors are required to prove only the 165 charges against Holmes \u2014 not why they believe he committed the crimes. Holmes' attorney, Tamara Brady, focused on perceptions of Holmes and whether the jury candidates could be objective given the litany of charges against him and the public scrutiny they will face. She asked how they felt listening for nearly two hours as Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. read a list of the charges, including each victim's name. She wondered if prospective jurors would be too sympathetic to survivors. She said she was nervous 'about whether Mr. Holmes can get a fair trial in this case or whether it's just too big'. JURORS' CONCERNS. Potential jurors told attorneys they worry about what their neighbors might think if they reach an unpopular verdict and whether reporters would harass their families. One man said he was reassured when the judge told him steps were taken to shield his identity. And many pledged they would not let their decision-making be influenced by concern about what others think. Other candidates expressed trepidation about hearing graphic testimony and perhaps being overwhelmed by emotion. WHAT'S TAKEN SO LONG? Some prospective jurors have asked the judge why it has taken nearly three years for the case to come to trial. Samour has said it's not an unusual amount of time for a trial this complex. The death penalty and insanity plea introduced complicated and time-consuming legal requirements. After nearly three months, and almost three years since the mass shooting, the jurors were chosen from among hundreds who filled out written questionnaires, then returned for one-on-one sessions, where they were questioned about their views on the death penalty and mental illness. Court officials initially summoned an unprecedented 9,000 people. WHAT ABOUT OTHER LARGE TRIALS? In the amount of time it has taken so far in Denver, federal jurors in Boston convicted marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. That case was accelerated by Tsarnaev's admission that he participated in the April 2013 bombings and that his brother, Tamerlan, was the mastermind. The Texas trial for the killer of a former Navy SEAL depicted in the movie 'American Sniper' was complicated by publicity about the film. But jury selection moved quickly because it didn't involve concerns about the large number of people affected by the crime. WHAT'S NEXT? The chosen jurors will report to court the afternoon of April 27 for opening statements. People enter and leave the Arapahoe County District Court in Centennial on Monday where the jury for the trial of James Holmes were selected. Holmes is charged with killing 12 people and wounding 70 others in the July 2012 attack at a movie theater in suburban Denver.\n","right_summary":"The 12 jurors and 12 alternates were chosen on Tuesday after a selection process that began on January 20.

{"document":"Eden Hazard and Harry Kane appear set to contest the PFA Player of the Year award after the six-man shortlist was unveiled. Hazard is hot favourite thanks to his consistently brilliant form for Chelsea, runaway leaders at the top of the Barclays Premier League, but Kane is the homespun hero after a fabulous breakthrough season at Tottenham. The 21-year-old Spurs striker has 29 goals in all competitions to date and forced his way into Roy Hodgson\u2019s squad, scoring within 79 seconds of his England debut against Lithuania last month. Harry Kane's prolific form for Tottenham has seen him nominated for PFA Player of the Year. Eden Hazard (left) has propelled Chelsea to the top of the Premier League with his brilliant displays. Diego Costa (right) scores for Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final victory over Tottenham at Wembley. Alexis Sanchez has had no trouble adapting to the Premier League, scoring 20 times for Arsenal so far. Eden Hazard - Chelsea. Diego Costa - Chelsea. Harry Kane - Tottenham Hotspur. Alexis Sanchez - Arsenal. David de Gea - Manchester United. Philippe Coutinho - Liverpool. Kane, the only English player up for the main award, has scored 19 in the Premier League, the same number as Diego Costa, who is also on the shortlist, along with Alexis Sanchez, Philippe Coutinho and David de Gea. Manchester City\u2019s miserable demise is perhaps summed up by the fact none of their players made the cut, including Sergio Aguero who also has 19 Premier League goals and is locked together with Kane and Costa in the race for the Golden Boot. Hazard, 24, is heavily odds-on with the bookmakers after leading Chelsea\u2019s charge for a first title in five years and 17 goals in all competitions. Goalkeeper David de Gea (left) has been Manchester United's most impressive player of the season. Philippe Coutinho (left) has enjoyed his best season yet for Liverpool and is also up for Player of the Year. The PFA Young Player of the Year nominations are:. Eden Hazard - Chelsea. Harry Kane - Tottenham Hotspur. Philippe Coutinho - Liverpool. Raheem Sterling - Liverpool. David de Gea - Manchester United. Thibaut Courtois - Chelsea. Arsene Wenger plumped for Hazard when asked to name his winner, without voting for anyone from his Arsenal squad. Sanchez made an explosive start to the campaign but his form has faded during the spring, when the votes are cast. The same could be said for Costa, who scored 13 of his 19 Chelsea goals before the turn of the year. De Gea\u2019s early-season form was strong, too, keeping Manchester United in contention for the top four as Louis van Gaal struggled to find the right formula. Hazard (left) poses with former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez (right) after last year's award ceremony. John Terry voted for Coutinho but the Brazilian is an outsider because Liverpool have been unable to match last season\u2019s success.

Kane is the favourite to win the Young Player award.\n","right_summary":"Harry Kane nominated for PFA Player of the Year after prolific season.

{"document":"Creating romantic, sepia-toned images is a cinch now that we have Instagram filters to play with. But back in the early 21st century, taking a picture was an entirely different process, requiring patience, precision and a very talented eye. Dreamlike snaps of a young woman in red posing at Lulworth Cove, Dorset, in 1913 have now been revealed as some of the earliest surviving colour photographs. Scroll down for video. A collection of pictures of Christina O'Gorman posing for her father, electrical engineer and photographer Mervyn O'Gorman, back in 1913 have been revealed as some of the earliest colour photographs ever taken. The ethereal images were taken on the beach at Lulworth Cove, Dorset, when Malcolm was 42. The images are part of the Royal Photographic Society, held at the National Media Museum, and are currently on display at the National Media Museum, Bradford. They are among a collection of the world's oldest surviving photographs. The woman in question was teenager Christina O'Gorman, posing for her father, electrical engineer and photographer Mervyn O'Gorman back in 1913. Mervyn was 42 at the time when he took the images of his daughter, who languidly sits, in an array of vibrant red outfits, including a swimsuit, a cloak and a shirt. The teen, characterised by her long strawberry-blonde hair, poses in different scenarios on the beach at Lulworth Cove in the English county of Dorset and appears unaware of her father. The delicately-coloured images are on display at the National Media Museum in Bradford. Christina is seen sitting on the Dorset beach with friends in the 102-year-old images. The strawberry-blonde teenager wore red, probably at the request of her father as the vibrant colour captured particularly well via the autochrome process. Mervyn was known as an early pioneer of colour photography and used the autochrome process to capture the haunting images. Patented in 1903, the process involved using glass plates covered in potato starches grains to filter pictures with dye. Mervyn was known as an early pioneer of colour photography and often used the autochrome process, which involved using glass plates covered in potato starches grains to filter pictures with dye. Christina's life remains a mystery as there are no recorded detail of the then-teen's life. The National Media Museum explained: 'The comparatively long exposure time has given the sea a glassy quality and the large aperture setting and narrow depth of field has put Durdle Door in the background into soft focus.' The repetition of the red attire was due to the fact that the vibrant colour captured particularly well in an autochrome process. Mervyn died in 1958, with his wife Florence passing 27 years beforehand in 1931.

{"document":"After a weekend shipwreck off the coast of Italy that may have killed hundreds of migrants, the International Organization for Migrants said Monday that there may be three more migrant boats in distress in international waters. Authorities still don't know the fate of many of the passengers, including children, who were on the large ship bound from Libya to Europe that capsized Saturday night in the frigid waters of the Mediterranean Sea. That sinking may be the worst in a series of disasters in which migrants have lost their lives on vessels that are too rickety to survive long voyages. \"Gangs of criminals are putting people on a boat, sometimes even at gunpoint,\" Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said. \"They're putting them on the road to death, really, and nothing else.\" A rescue operation is still underway for people who were on the ship from Libya, and the number of potential victims is not clear. A Bangladeshi survivor told investigators there were 950 people on board. Previous estimates put the number around 700. Maltese authorities, who are working with Italian rescuers, said around 50 people had been saved. But the Italian Coast Guard said 28 people had been rescued and 24 bodies recovered. Two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in Sicily, according to Italian police officer Maria Guia Federico. On Monday, European Union ministers met in Luxembourg and proposed a 10-point plan to help address the crisis. \"We are not yet working on numbers, but what we have agreed on today is, for sure, the need to increase significantly the resources at sea, and the level of the operation, doing more search and rescue and doing it more together,\" Federica Mogherini told CNN's \"The World Right Now with Hala Gorani.\" The EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy said the European Union must fight human traffickers, strengthen Europeans' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees. \"We need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people, so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions,\" Mogherini said. \"My pain is that it was a reaction coming too late after so many people died.\" Migrants have been attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to southern Europe for years, but authorities have reported a sudden surge in the past 10 days, along with a grim spike in the number of those who are killed en route. Already this year, more than 900 migrants are believed to have died while crossing the Mediterranean, far more than during the same period in 2014, the International Organization for Migration said last week. Since the beginning of 2015, more than 35,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea -- 23,500 have landed in Italy and more than 12,000 in Greece, according to the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights. While those numbers sound high, they were even higher the previous year. In 2014, approximately 219,000 refugees and migrants sailed across the Mediterranean, with most having to be rescued by the Italian Navy, Coast Guard or merchant ships, the UNCHR said. It is estimated that 3,500 people in 2014 died at sea. On Monday, yet another boat sank off the Greek island of Rhodes, killing at least three people, the Greek Merchant Marine Ministry said. Of the 83 people reported on board, at least 57 survived. Those confirmed dead were a man, a woman and a child. The capsizing of the ship that departed from Libya marked the worst such disaster so far. As rescuers approached the boat in response to a distress call Saturday night, authorities say, migrants moved to one side, hoping to be saved. Their movement caused the large, multilevel boat to capsize about 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Libya, sending many passengers plunging into the sea. According to one Bangladeshi survivor, large numbers of people remained trapped inside the boat as it sank. Smugglers -- human traffickers organizing the voyages -- had locked the doors to the lower levels of the vessel, the survivor told Italian authorities. \"Our troops, together with the Italian navy, are literally looking through the bodies to try to find someone who's still alive,\" Muscat said. While the shipwreck was an accident, Muscat slammed the human traffickers whom he accused of risking people's lives by putting them on rickety ships in unpredictable waters. It's \"genocide -- nothing less than genocide, really,\" Muscat told CNN. \"A mass grave is being created in the Mediterranean Sea and European policies are responsible,\" said Loris De Filippi, the president of the international aid group Doctors Without Borders. He compared the high number of deaths to \"figures from a war zone.\" De Filippi called on European states to immediately launch large-scale search and rescue operations with proactive patrolling as close as possible to Libyan shores. \"Faced with thousands of desperate people fleeing wars and crises, Europe has closed borders, forcing people in search of protection to risk their lives and die at sea,\" he said. \"This tragedy is only just beginning, but it can and should be stopped.\" Save the Children similarly called on European officials to do more. \"What we needed from EU foreign ministers today was life-saving action, but they dithered,\" the group's CEO Justin Forsyth said in a statement. \"With each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and Europe slips further into an immoral abyss. Right now, people desperately seeking a better life are drowning in politics.\" Many of the migrants who board ships to cross the Mediterranean come from sub-Saharan Africa, often traveling for weeks or months just to get to the ships. They're seeking a better life, but many are exploited by the ruthless smugglers who organize the voyages. \"There is a well-oiled machine with the human traffickers, first by land and then by sea, and they feel the need for these desperate people who just want to get to Europe at all costs,\" said Rome-based journalist Barbie Nadeau. The situation on board the boat that sank over the weekend isn't unusual, based on accounts of previous voyages. On old fishing boats, \"people are crammed into what used to be the frozen live tank compartments in the bottom of the ship,\" Nadeau said. \"Those are the cheaper tickets. People that want to be out on the upper deck, which is the prime space, pay a little more for that service.\" Traffickers are believed to charge anywhere from 6,000 euros to 8,000 euros ($6,450 to $8,600) per person for the dangerous voyage, she said. Italy's proximity to the North African coast puts it on the front line of tackling the continent's migration crisis. \"We're swamped,\" Sandro Gozi, the Italian minister for European affairs, told French daily Le Monde. \"There's not even enough space in Sicily's cemeteries to bury the dead.\" An Italian search and rescue program, Mare Nostrum, was credited with rescuing more than 160,000 migrants in the space of a year. But it ended in October because of budget constraints and criticism from the European Union that the program itself was encouraging migrants to head across the Mediterranean. The European Union's border control agency, Frontex, started its own mission in November, known as Triton, with a budget of less than a third of that of Mare Nostrum. Frontex has no vessels or surveillance equipment of its own, so has to rely on European member states to lend it ships. As anti-immigrant parties thrive across the continent, European nations are collectively struggling to cope with the migration crisis on their doorstep. \"We can't act as if each tragedy is the last while crossing our fingers that another one doesn't happen,\" Gozi told Le Monde, lamenting \"a total absence\" of European Union policy on how to deal with refugees arriving in Europe.

{"document":"Just one day after it was learned Bobby Flay had separated from his wife of 10 years, Law & Order: SVU star Stephanie March, the famous chef has filed for divorce. According to TMZ, the 50-year-old Food Network standout is 'heartbroken' about the split and his wife is 'mighty unhappy' with the prenup which is said to favor Bobby. Also on Friday the\u00a0New York Daily News\u00a0claimed the actress questioned her spouse about rumours he was romantically involved with Mad Men star January Jones in 2010. Scroll down for video... Done: Bobby Flay has filed for divorce from his wife of 10 years Stephanie March, TMZ reported on Friday; here the couple is pictured in June 2013. 'I know Stephanie basically asked him after January Jones, \"Did you f*** her?\"' an insider told the site. March was said to be suspicious after her husband happened to be on the scene when single mother Jones got into a car accident in LA in 2010. The source added that he denied any romance. Jones is now dating Will Forte, who she was seen with in February at the premiere of The Last Man On Earth. There was concern about this woman: The New York Daily News on Friday claimed that March asked her spouse if he had any romantic liaisons with January Jones - he allegedly said no; here Jones is pictured in March. Her love interest these days:\u00a0Jones is now dating Will Forte, who she was seen with in February at the premiere of The Last Man On Earth. Legal documents obtained by TMZ state that the marriage has 'broken down irretrievably.' It has been reported they separated three weeks ago. And because they have no children together there is no issue about child support but they are fighting over property already, it was alleged on Friday. He has already moved out of their New York City apartment. The couple has secured their own attorneys and are discussing the terms of divorce, according to the news site. Once so close: Flay and March, who reportedly separated three weeks ago,  pictured in January 2013. TMZ went on to report that the marriage began to unravel over the past year and a half. Sources told TMZ that the union crumbled when Stephanie's appendix burst and Bobby didn't come to the hospital until the next day. Stephanie claimed, according to TMZ, that Bobby said 'he was busy with work' and instead sent his assistants to help her. Moved out: The Iron Chef Of America star - pictured in 2013 - is said to have moved out of the couple's New York City apartment. Boiling point: The marriage suffered when Stephanie's appendix burst and Bobby didn't come to the hospital until the next day because he was busy, TMZ reported; Flay was pictured with President Obama in 2009. In February, the pair didn't celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary together. According to TMZ, Bobby attended a wine festival in Florida with his assistants instead. This will be Stephanie's first divorce and a third for Flay, whose two previous marriages both ended in divorce. In January, Flay was rumoured to be romantically involved with fellow chef Giada De Laurentiis after the 44-year-old Giada At Home star announced her split from her husband of 11 years, Todd Thompson. The Iron Chef Of America star and Giada were spotted having 'a festive dinner out together' at Cecconi's, in the private Soho Beach House, in Miami Beach on December 27, 2014, as People reported. In a statement to Gossip Cop, Giada said that any suggestion of a romance was false. Bobby has a daughter Sophie with second wife Kate Connelly, who he wed in 1995 and divorced in 1999. His first wife is Debra Ponzek, who he wed in 1991 and split from in 1993.

{"document":"Former Italy forward Antonio Di Natale has described Alexis Sanchez as the best strike partner he's ever had and insisted the Arsenal forward is better than Neymar. Di Natale, who won 42 caps for Italy between 2002 and 2012, spent five years playing alongside Sanchez at Udinese, who he still captains at the age of 37. Azzurri legends Francesco Totti and Alessandro Del Piero are just two of the names Di Natale has played alongside but he told Arsenal's official website\u00a0that Sanchez tops the lot. Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez has been hailed as the best strike partner Antonio Di Natale ever had. Sanchez has been in storming form with 20 goals in all competitions during his debut season with the Gunners. The Chilean played alongside Di Natale (left) for five years at Serie A side Udinese. He said: 'I know what you are going to ask. And the answer is: Yes he's the best partner I had in my life. 'Like you say, I've played with a lot of champions, but he is the best; and he' s proven it by performing for enormous clubs such as Barcelona and Arsenal. 'It' s quite easy to be a star in a little or medium team, where there is no pressure and where competition is far to be ferocious. 'But to confirm your individual qualities within the biggest teams is something only few can achieve.' Asked to compare Sanchez and Neymar, Di Natale added: 'If I had to choose one, I'd choose Alexis: because he's a little more concrete.' Di Natale claims his former team-mate is better than Neymar, who effectively replaced him at Barcelona. Former World Cup winners Francesco Totti (left) and Alessandro del Piero are among Di Natale's former strike partners with Italy. Di Natale has put his former team-mate's unbelievable work ethic as the secret behind his success. 'I was amazed by his technical skills: he did things with the ball that were more typical of a juggler than a footballer. But what really impressed me was the approach he had to the everyday work. 'In my career, I've seen a lot of talented players squandering their abilities with the wrong attitude, with a sort of indolence. Alexis was the contrary. 'I've never seen him distracted, he was always attentive and focused, he was always ready to work harder in order to improve, to add some new trick to his natural talent. 'This is probably his secret, and the thing that has allowed him to become one of the greatest players around today: he combines individual quality with a willingness for collective sacrifice.'\n","right_summary":"Antonio Di Natale played alongside Alexis Sanchez at Serie A side Udinese.

{"document":"Steven Gerrard looked glum at Boujis nightclub in Kensington after being knocked out of the FA Cup on Sunday - and his Liverpool farewell tour is unlikely to have him breaking into a grin either. The Liverpool captain spent the evening in the VIP room with friends, knowing full well that defeat by Aston Villa at Wembley confirmed what he had feared all season: he would end his final year at Anfield without a trophy. Sunday's loss means there will be no birthday FA Cup final for him on May 30, while Chelsea's victory over Manchester United in the Barclays Premier League made it mathematically impossible for Liverpool to catch the league leaders. Steven Gerrard is seen at Boujis nightclub in Kensington Sunday night after being knocked out of the FA Cup. Gerrard looked glum after it was confirmed he would end the season without a trophy before moving on. Gerrard climbs into a car outside the club in London as his Liverpool career winds down to a poor ending. Aston Villa's players celebrate their victory at Wembley while Gerrard reflects on the pitch in defeat. Sunday April 25: West Bromwich Albion (A) Tuesday April 28: Hull City (A) Saturday May 2: Queens Park Rangers (H) Sunday May 10: Chelsea (A) Saturday May 16: Crystal Palace (H) Sunday May 24: Stoke City (A) As the curtain comes down on his 17 years in the Liverpool first-team, Gerrard has just six games left to play in a red shirt with little to play for and a fixture list that seem unlikely to bring his smile back. Among the opponents that late April and May bring are four teams in the bottom half of the Premier League table: West Bromwich Albion, Hull City, Queens Park Rangers and Crystal Palace. Towards the end of that run, a trip to champions-elect Chelsea beckons and then Gerrard is set to play his final game in England at the Britannia Stadium against Stoke City on May 24, a dead-rubber that is unlikely to even be shown on television. While the supporters from the Kop will undoubtedly give their Champions League-winning captain a huge send off at Anfield against Palace on May 16, it does give a sense of anti-climax after one of the finest careers seen in the Premier League era. Anything but a defeat against Arsenal for Chelsea would likely see them likely to be confirmed as champions before Gerrard comes to Stamford Bridge, and with a title party ongoing he will be reminded of the one prize that has eluded him throughout his career in England. Liverpool's players, including their captain, were outclassed by Villa at Wembley and deservedly lost. Wembley, where Gerrard has captained his country on many occasions, now has a final bad memory for him. Liverpool fans show their support for Gerrard - his latest Anfield appearance is against Crystal Palace. It will also bring back memories of his slip to let in Demba Ba at Anfield, almost a year ago to the day, a fatal error that robbed the 34-year-old of a maiden title last season. The chance of leading a guard of honour if Chelsea seal the league crown against Leicester City or Crystal Palace would rub salt further into the wounds. Jose Mourinho might have asked the Chelsea supporters to stop singing the about Gerrard's unfortunate tumble, but the Stamford Bridge faithful are unlikely to relent as they take the opportunity to give their two-time transfer target a farewell he won't forget - for the wrong reasons. Gerrard slipped up in last year's game against Chelsea to gift Demba Ba a goal and throw away the title. Memories of that mistake will be strong in the mind for Gerrard is Chelsea are celebrating winning the league. England's failure at the World Cup - with Gerrard as captain - followed, and he quit the international game. Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and Wayne Rooney leave the pitch after drawing their final game with Costa Rica. It has been a difficult final year for Gerrard. Missing out on last year's title was followed by captaining England at a winless World Cup and now another trophyless year where he has found himself surplus to Brendan Rodgers' starting XI at times with Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen preferred as options in midfield. The decision to retire from the international game after last summer's tournament, with a focus on his club career, didn't work out either with Liverpool knocked out of all four cups - including at the first possible opportunity in the Champions League. And now, a Premier League legend bids farewell in a way that doesn't seem fitting. There is no big finale like in Istanbul or Cardiff all those years ago, instead Gerrard leaves Liverpool and England with a whimper. Now, the Liverpool captain's  final game is at the Britannia Stadium - though he did score there last year. April 27, 2014: With Liverpool seemingly set for the Premier League title, Gerrard slips to gift Chelsea a goal in a 2-0 defeat at Anfield to put the initiative back into the hands of eventual champions Manchester City. May 5, 2014: Liverpool squander a 3-0 lead against Crystal Palace to see their title hopes suffer a further blow that they would not recover from. June 19, 2014: Having lost their opening game against Italy, England are level with Uruguay until captain Gerrard gives the ball away to allow Luis Suarez to score a winner. England left the tournament without win. November 4, 2014: Gerrard is left out of the team that loses 1-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu against Real Madrid in the Champions League. December 9, 2014: The captain scores but Liverpool are knocked out of the Champions League after a 1-1 draw with Basle leaves them on just five points in Group B. January 27, 2015: Liverpool are knocked out of the Capital One Cup at the semi-final stage after losing 1-0 to Chelsea in extra time at Stamford Bridge, with Gerrard unable to inspire a victory. February 26, 2015: Gerrard misses Europa League tie with Besiktas through injury and they crash out on penalties in Istanbul. March 22, 2015: Any hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League for Liverpool take a huge blow in a 2-0 defeat by Manchester United at Anfield. Gerrard is left out of the starting XI and comes on as a second half substitute but is sent off just 38 seconds after coming on. April 19, 2015: Liverpool lose their FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa to end all hopes of a trophy in Gerrard's final season. May 10, 2015: Gerrard travels with Liverpool to face Chelsea, who could have already wrapped up the title, and faces being ridiculed by the Stamford Bridge crowd.: Sto. May 24, 2015: Seventeen years playing in the Premier League end with a trip to face Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium in a game that will likely be of little\u00a0importance\u00a0to either side. P.S. Along with Gerrard and Frank Lampard, there's another member of England's much-maligned 'golden generation' who is likely to be leaving the Premier League in the summer: Rio Ferdinand. The Queens Park Rangers defender's farewell season has fallen flat as he spends much of his time sat on the bench at Loftus Road in their relegation battle. Ferdinand struggled from the start of the season at the centre of the Rs defence after moving on from years of loyal service at Manchester United. The 36-year-old's final days in England's top tier are so chilled, that he showed off his ability to watch House of Cards on his way into training in the back of his car on Monday morning.

{"document":"There will be calls for England to get rid of Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott on the back of their failures here but I think they should both play all three Tests against West Indies before any sort of decision is made. We are talking about two batsmen with phenomenal Test records who have done it against Australia in the past and, with good players like that, you do not jettison them easily. Cook, for instance, will end up with one of the greatest of all England records and you have to give people of that calibre every possible chance to show they are worth a place. Jonathan Trott (left) and Alastair Cook head out to open England's second innings against West Indies. Trott walks past Cook after he was dismissed for just four runs by\u00a0Jerome Taylor on day three. I said after the first day of this Test that England\u2019s top order was a bit one-paced which could be an issue but that does not mean I think they should be dropped unless there is conclusive evidence they are in decline. England\u2019s new opening pair have very different issues. Trott will have played all sorts of mind games with himself ahead of this game, telling himself to enjoy it and trying to forget how people perceive him after leaving Australia. He will have desperately tried not to build this Test up too much but, once out in the middle, he will have known how important it is. You could see how frenetic he was and how much he was moving at the crease. When you are nervous and desperate to do well your movements can become exaggerated as emotion takes hold. He has got to tell himself to stay still at the crease. The Trott I remember was almost Jacques Kallis-like in how still he was. If it were not for his scratching around you wouldn\u2019t notice him. The Trott I remember would get to 70 before you knew it and we can\u2019t judge his comeback on a Test where he has received good deliveries in both innings. Trott was making his first Test appearance for England in 18 months against the West Indies. He has to tell himself to calm down, stay still and chill a bit at the crease and it will be hard because the Duke ball is swinging and he is not accustomed to being an opener. He has been at three his whole career. If he does not make runs in the next two Tests and England are convinced he won\u2019t be able to become the player he was then that is the time to have a look at someone else. Not now. The captain, in contrast, has a technical issue. Cook is mentally one of the strongest cricketers England have ever produced, an incredible fighter and an incredible bloke who has such a burning desire to prove people wrong. Trott leaves the field in\u00a0Antigua following his poor showing on day three of the first Test. Yes, form is a concern \u2014 he hasn\u2019t scored an international century in two years but this is a man who reached 25 Test hundreds in record time. And it is true to say he has been found out. Cook based his game around three shots \u2014 the cut, the pull and clip off the hip \u2014 and he would get lots of runs. Now opponents are bowling at him in the areas he doesn\u2019t want them to and he has a problem when the ball is moving. But the swinging ball is not a new phenomenon, especially to an opener brought up in England, and Cook has to score runs against the moving ball now if he is going to prolong his Test career. Trott was very much in the mould of South Africa batsman Jacques Kallis (above) when he was on form. Cook has now gone 61 combined Test and ODI innings without making a century. West Indies will be very disciplined for an hour but their third seamer is Jason Holder. This is not Australia. If Cook can just sit in, be a bit more disciplined outside off stump and see off that new ball then the run-making opportunities will come. Bowlers will get bored before he does. It is not that he cannot score when the ball is pitched up. You don\u2019t score 8,423 Test runs without being able to play off the front foot. Of course he can. But in his first 10 or 15 minutes he is pushing too hard at the ball rather than letting it come to him. These are both exceptional players and you are always a better player when you are out of a side. It takes a long time to make a Test player \u2014don\u2019t discard them until you are absolutely sure the time is right.\n","right_summary":"Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott have both struggled with the bat. Trott looked nervous while his movement was erratic. Cook hasn't scored an international century in two years.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott have both had a shaky start, but their phenomenal Test records speak for themselves. They should both continue playing and prove their worth in the next three tests against West Indies."}
{"document":"While young children must be shown the highway code to cross roads safely, it seems chimpanzees have taught themselves. Researchers studying chimps in Uganda say the apes are having to adapt to cope with increasingly busy roads cutting across their territory. They found at a busy asphalted road through the Sebitoli area of Kibale National Park in Uganda, the chimps have learned to look both ways before crossing. Chimpanzees crossing a busy road in Kibale National Park in Uganda (above) have learned to look for traffic. Scientists discovered the chimps will also often run across roads, while dominant males will wait to ensure younger chimps cross safely. It is the first time chimpanzees have been seen to change their behaviour to adapt to busy roads. Chimpanzees appear to flavour their food with herbs, researchers have suggested. Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and her colleagues have found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda eat three different types of leaf while consuming meat they had caught. They reason that if this was for medicinal purposes, different animals would eat different plants depending on their ailments. However, the animals in each group all tended to eat the same plants with their meat, suggesting they were eating them for flavour instead. Dr Krief and her team found that separate groups of chimpanzees at Budongo Forest Reserve and Kibale National Park ate plants while chewing meat. Marie Cibot, a biologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, who led the work, said the spread of road infrastructure in Africa was posing a growing threat to wildlife in many countries. She said: 'Although the asphalted road represents a substantial threat to crossing animals, chimpanzees took into account this risk. 'More than 90 per cent of the individuals looked right and left before and while crossing. 'Chimpanzees crossed in small subgroups. Whole parties crossed more rapidly when chimpanzees were more numerous in the crossing groups.' The researchers say the road in Sebitoli sees around 89 motor vehicles an hour racing down it at speeds of between 40mph and 60mph. The researchers said they saw several different primates killed on the roads in the past year. However, chimpanzees living in the surrounding forests appear to have learned about the danger it poses. They watched 122 chimps cross the road over the course of two and half years. They found most of the chimps looked for traffic before crossing and as they crossed. Adult chimps, like this one, tended to wait for younger chimps to cross and checked they got over safely. Females with young and injured adults tended to cross less frequently. Around 20 per cent of the chimps that crossed would turn to check on other members of the group to ensure they were crossing safely. They also tended to form small groups of between two to three chimpanzees that crossed at a time. Chimps have been noticed to cross in similar ways on other non-asphalted roads. However, on quieter roads, adults tend to lead the group in a similar way as they do when checking for predators rather than splitting up into smaller groups. The researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, have appealed for measures to help reduce the impact roads were having on wildlife. Miss Cibot, who worked on the study with Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and the Great Ape Conservation Project in Uganda, said bridges or underpasses could be provided to help keep chimps safe. The team are hoping to work with the Ugandan authorities to test new safety measures. Miss Cibot said: 'These observations are relevant for our understanding of adaptive behavior among chimpanzees in human-impacted habitats. 'Further investigations are needed to better evaluate the effects of busy roads on adolescent female dispersal and on their use of territories. 'Mitigation measures, like bridges, underpasses, reduced speed limits, speed-bumps, signposts, or police controls, should be established in this area.'\n","right_summary":"Chimps were observed crossing busy road in Kibale National Park, Uganda.

{"document":"An Australian couple who abandoned a boy born in a surrogacy deal in India were repeatedly told the child would be left stateless, new evidence shows. Documents reveal the shocking details of the case that saw a couple return to Australia with a baby girl while leaving her twin brother behind. Australian government officials had full knowledge of the startling ordeal, according to documents obtained\u00a0the ABC. An Australian couple who abandoned a boy born in a surrogacy deal in India were repeatedly told the child would be left stateless, new evidence shows (stock image) The FOI documents reportedly show staff at the Australian High Commission in India and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were aware the couple was from New South Wales, where it is illegal to enter into international surrogacy arrangements. Conversations between the Australian High Commission in New Delhi and Government officials in Canberra detail how the couple travelled to India in late 2012 and seeked citizenship for a baby girl but told consular staff they would be leaving her twin brother behind because they could not afford him. The couple reportedly told staff they wanted a baby girl to 'complete their family'. The Australian man told consulate staff he would be giving the boy to some friends in India 'who were unable to conceive a child', according to the report. The couple was told the boy would be left stateless if they followed through on plans to abandon him, because India does not recognise surrogate children as citizens. Documents reveal the shocking details of the case that saw a couple return to Australia with a baby girl while leaving her twin brother behind. 'If the parents do not apply for Australian citizenship for the child, the child will be stateless in India... our ability to provide assistance to a non Australian citizen is limited,' a DFAT email in December, 2012 said. There were also fears last year that the boy may have been sold. Chief Justice of the Family Court, Diana Bryant, said  consular staff had told her of their concerns. The FOI documents reportedly show staff at the Australian High Commission in India and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were aware the couple was from New South Wales, where it is illegal to enter into international surrogacy arrangements. 'They expressed to me that in fact money had changed hands, and if that's true, then that's basically trafficking children,' she said. 'We're commoditising children and that's a huge concern. It's in breach of all sorts of human rights conventions \u2013 it's a criminal offence in many places.' If money was paid, any adoption would be deemed invalid under India's Hindu Adoption Act. The Indian case is similar to the recent baby Gammy case, who was born in Thailand to a surrogate mother and whose Australian parents only brought back his twin sister.

After giving the spider some more whacks for good measure, the man was heard saying: \u2018It\u2019s dead.\u2019 Finally the broom was used for what it was made for - sweeping up what was left on the floor. The Australian Repile Park website explains that after mating, the female wolf spider produces a silk mat into which she deposits around 100 eggs. Soon the tiny baby spiders are trying to make a run for it all over the kitchen floor. The silk is then rolled into a protective ball which she attaches to her abdomen and proceeds to carry it around with her until the eggs hatch. After hatching, the babies crawl onto the mother's back and remain there until their fat reserves have been used up and they need to start finding their own food, which may take several months. That is unless the female spider is cracked a few times over the head with a broom. With the spider now dead the man sweeps it up as well as the babies that are spread all around.\n","right_summary":"A wolf spider races across a kitchen floor in Hallett Cove, South Australia.

The Cherries take on Sheffield Wednesday at the Goldsands Stadium on Saturday followed by the visit of Bolton nine days later and then a last-day trip to Charlton. The four-horse race for automatic promotion - second-placed Norwich face fourth-placed Middlesbrough on Friday night - is expected to go down to the wire with just two points separating those in contention. Eddie Howe and his Bournemouth players applaud travelling fans after victory against Reading. Howe has called on supporters to inspire the Cherries to win promotion from the Championship. 'The pleasing thing from our perspective regarding our home form is that it's improved as the season has gone on,' Howe told the club's official website. 'We have become more consistent, more adept at dealing with the different problems that we face and how teams set up against us, so we are in a good place at home. 'Hopefully the crowd can inspire us because we are going to need them more than ever. 'In these two games I'm sure there will be moments where we are either under pressure or need a lift and that's when hopefully they can do their bit for us.' Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic refuses to look beyond Saturday's home game against Birmingham as his third-placed side bid to climb back into the top two. Slavisa Jokanovic is not looking beyond Birmingham as Watford chase automatic promotion. 'There are three games more,' Jokanovic told his club's official website. 'We must continue, we must be ready.

We cannot talk about taking nine points because this is not what is in front of us.' Steve McClaren's Derby must improve on their recent away form at Huddersfield if they are to secure a play-off finish.

{"document":"Margaret Gretton has been banned from classrooms for labelling an Asian job applicant 'Taliban' and calling special needs pupils 'roadkill' A primary school headteacher has been banned from classrooms for labelling an Asian job applicant 'Taliban' after referring to special needs pupils as 'roadkill'. Margaret Gretton, 46,\u00a0has been barred indefinitely from the profession after she referred to the applicant as a member of the terror group and talked of 'bombs and blowing up the school' in an Asian accent. A disciplinary panel of the National College for Teaching and Leadership in Coventry ruled Ms Gretton 'exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability'. The panel said she showed no remorse for 'deliberate' and 'repeated' actions while head of Burton Joyce Primary School in Nottingham. They heard that she had mocked special needs students by referring to them as 'cuckoo' and said she didn't want to encourage children 'like that' to come to the school. She even displayed a Golly magnet in her office and made 'monkey noises' on one occasion when talking about black people. Her shocking behaviour continued over a 'sustained period of time' while she was headteacher of the school from September 2007 until November 2013. The panel concluded Ms Gretton 'displayed racist attitudes and behaviour in that - on one or more occasions you inappropriately commented in relation to a photograph of a male Asian job applicant.' It said her comments included 'would you hire me\u2026I'm in the Taliban', or words to that effect, referring to the man as 'Mohammed', or words to that effect, and referring to 'bombs and blowing up the school', or words to that effect, in an Asian accent. A teacher at the school, named only as Staff Member E, told the panel that Ms Gretton said to her, unprompted: 'Do you like black men?' The teacher said she was 'taken aback' by the question, but added that it did not bother her, and her mother's partner was black and from Jamaica. She told the panel that Ms Gretton then 'burst out laughing and said words to the effect of 'does he have big lips?...does he look like a monkey?' and then went on to make monkey noises.' The headteacher denied making the comments, but the panel said it was 'satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the comments, or words similar to them, were made by Ms Gretton. ' The panel also found that she 'expressed inappropriate and discriminatory attitudes towards SEN [Special Educational Needs] pupils in the presence of school staff.' The panel said 'exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability' while head of Burton Joyce Primary School in Nottingham (pictured) They said she had used the word 'cuckoo' or words to that affect and said 'we don't want to encourage children like that to come here.' She was also found to have 'deliberately tried to upset' a special needs pupil, 'frightened him', and 'tried to make him cry.' Witness G gave evidence to the panel that on one occasion in 2010 a pupil would not come out from underneath a table and was disrupting the lesson so, as a teaching assistant, she asked Ms Gretton for assistance. She told the panel that 'Ms Gretton said 'It's like something from One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest' and said 'cuckoo, cuckoo' whilst twirling her finger at the side of her head.' A Special Education Needs co-ordinator, who also gave evidence to the panel, said that during a discussion in 2010 about creating a disabled parking space at the school car park she mentioned that Ms Gretton's parking space was the obvious place to put it. However she said that Ms Gretton said: 'We don't want to encourage people like that here.' Ms Gretton was also found to have bullied members of staff which the panel described as 'wholly unacceptable.' It concluded: 'The panel considered that Ms Gretton was not acting under duress, she lacked any insight into her behaviour and demonstrated no remorse. Her shocking behaviour continued over a 'sustained period of time' while she was headteacher of the school (pictured) \u00a0from September 2007 until November 2013. 'Her actions towards staff and pupils were deliberate, repeated and over a sustained period of time. Ms Gretton seriously abused her position of power and trust within the school. ' After the panel made its recommendations Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, decided to prohibit Ms Gretton from teaching indefinitely. He said: 'This is a case where the teacher has exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability.' He added: 'There has been no effort made by Ms Gretton to remedy the attitudinal deficiencies which have led her to behave in the way in which she did.' Describing his decision to prohibit the woman from teaching he said: ' This means that Ms Margaret Leandra Gretton is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England. 'Furthermore, in view of the seriousness of the allegations found proved against her, I have decided that Ms Margaret Leandra Gretton shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of her eligibility to teach.' Ms Gretton has right of appeal to the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court, until 28 days after she was given notice of the order.\n","right_summary":"Margaret Gretton, 46, has been barred indefinitely from the profession.

{"document":"Ordinary British tennis fans face a Wimbledon-type scramble for Davis Cup quarter-final tickets this summer and are likely to end up with less than half the overall allocation. There will be a capacity of 7,000 for July's match against France at London's Queen's Club, but well under 3,000 tickets may be available to the kind of supporters who created such an electric atmosphere in Glasgow for last month's first round. The rest will go to various organisations and governing bodies, with a considerable percentage going to well-heeled Queen's members as part of the deal to play the tie there. British tennis fans face a Wimbledon-type scramble for Davis Cup quarter-final tickets this summer. Andy Murray enjoys a spot of Champions League action alongside his friend Ross Hutchins at the Nou Camp. The Lawn Tennis Association acceded to the wishes of Andy Murray and GB Captain Leon Smith to play the tie on grass, which they feel best enhances their chances in what is a first Davis Cup quarter final staged at home in 29 years. That very much narrowed down the choice of venues for the tie that begins just five days after Wimbledon. The All England Club was never an option due to the stress the grass courts take during The Championships and ongoing development work there. A by-product is that tickets are likely to be as scarce as they are for the big fortnight. Sponsors plus organisations such as the LTA, Wimbledon, the International Tennis Federation and the French Federation have to be catered for. Queen's members will also have a considerable allocation as the tie means the stands there being up nearly all summer, with the AEGON Championships taking place in the middle of June as the main warm-up for SW19. Murray has an affinity for The Queen's club, having won the AEGON title there three times. Murray is currently practicing in Spain before beginning his clay court campaign later this year. The above will have until May 27 to take up or return their tickets, with only around 2,500 guaranteed to reach the ordinary public. A minimum 2,000 per day will then go on sale to those who are British Tennis Members \u2013 something that anyone can become by joining free \u2013 while at least 500 will go to supporters who have travelled abroad in recent years to support the British team. 'We have obligations to certain groups within the tennis family,' said an LTA spokesman. 'There are restrictions on numbers at the venue and we have to work within that.' Andy Murray, who has won the AEGON title three times, will lead the GB team in the match that takes place from July 17-19. France have seven singles players in the world's top 50, with their best grass court player Jo Wilfried Tsonga having just recovered from injury. The former Wimbledon champion \u2013 currently practising in Spain before beginning his Spring clay court campaign \u2013 is pleased with the venue, and may be called upon to play doubles as well as two singles matches.\n","right_summary":"Davis Cup quarter-final tickets will be hard to find for fans this summer.

{"document":"It's T20 season on the sub-continent and the world's best players are about the pad up for the latest edition of the Indian Premier League, cricket's most exciting and richest domestic tournament. Eight teams will play a total of 60 games over almost seven weeks across 12 venues all round India in a battle to be crowned champions of the tournament's eighth edition, with the final taking place at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on May 24. Can Kolkata Knight Riders retain their title? Will Virat Kohli lead the Royal Challengers Bangalore to their first title? Can MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings win their third crown? And who are the players to watch out for? Sportsmail tells you all you need to know in our guide to the 2015 Indian Premier League as India prepares for the spectacular cricket roadshow. MS Dhoni, pictured in the 2011 Champions League, is looking to guide Chennai Super Kings to a third title. CHENNAI SUPER KINGS. The bright yellow jerseys of the Super Kings are one of the iconic sights of the Indian Premier League. Led by the superstar Indian duo of MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina, Chennai are the most successful team in IPL history. As well as their back-to-back victories in 2010 and 2011, CSK have been losing finalists three times and never failed to reach the last four. In international players Dhoni, Raina, Ravi Ashwin, Ravi Jadeja and Mohit Sharma, the Super Kings have probably the best pool of Indian talent in the tournament, which is key given that seven of the starting XI have to be domestic players. The foreign talent is also strong, though, and includes New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, South African Faf du Plessis and West Indian all-rounder Dwyane Bravo. ONE TO WATCH: There are so many. Dhoni needs no introduction, Raina is the top scorer in IPL history, but MCCULLUM\u00a0is one of the most exciting players in world cricket at the moment. He hit the first ever IPL century in 2008 and will be looking to build on a brilliant World Cup campaign. Brendon McCullum's aggressive brand of cricket led New Zealand to the World Cup final. \u00a31,740,000\u00a0- Yuvraj Singh's salary, the highest in the 2015 tournament after he was picked up by Delhi Daredevils in the auction. 3325\u00a0- runs Suresh Raina has scored, the most in tournament history. 2008 - Year the IPL was first played. 119\u00a0- wickets taken by Lasith Malinga, the most in the history of the tournament. 60\u00a0- matches in the 2015 tournament. 46 - days the tournament lasts, beginning on April 8 and ending on May 24. 12 - venues to be used in 2015. 8\u00a0- teams in 2015 edition of the IPL. 3 - \u00a0English players in the tournament - Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara and Kevin Pietersen. DELHI DAREDEVILS. The side from the capital are out to prove a point having never won the tournament and never even reached the final. The Daredevils have missed out on the semi-finals the last two seasons and will be looking to get back on track this year. They are led by South African JP Duminy and a lot of their overseas talent also comes from the same country in the form of Quinton de Kock, Imran Tahir and Albie Morkel, although Sri Lankan all-rounder Angelo Mathews is a handy player as well. World Cup outcasts Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan and Amit Mishra, all of whom featured in India's successful 2011 team, will relish a return to the big stage and try and force themselves back into international reckoning. ONE TO WATCH: In 22-year-old DE KOCK, Delhi have the most exciting young wicketkeeper batsman in the world. De Kock has already scored six one-day international tons but his highest score in the World Cup was an unbeaten 78. 2011 World Cup winner Yuvraj Singh will be out to prove a point after being left out of this year's India team. KINGS XI PUNJAB. After years of just making up the numbers, the Kings XI Punjab lit up the 2014 tournament on their way to topping the table in the round-robin stage before losing in the final. Punjab's success in 2014 came largely thanks to their strong Australian contingent, and this year they will be just as reliant on the likes of Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Johnson, George Bailey and Shaun Marsh. But the Kings XI also have South African powerhouse David Miller in their ranks along with Sri Lankan Thisara Perera. Their Indian talent isn't the strongest in the tournament but Virender Sehwag and Murali Vijay have both performed on the big stage for their country, and 21-year-old Axar Patel is one of the best young talents in India. ONE TO WATCH: The destructive MAXWELL. One banner in the stands in Chandigarh last year read 'Glenndeep Singh Maxwell - the King of Punjab'. It was Maxwell's power-hitting that almost led his team to the 2014 title and he showed again at the World Cup just how dangerous he can be. Glenn Maxwell was one of the top run-scorers in the IPL last year and almost guided the Kings XI to the title. KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS. The reigning champions Knight Riders have one of the most balanced teams in the tournament and will be looking to win their third IPL title in four years. Gautam Gambhir's international career may have stalled, but he is still one of the most talented Indian batsmen out there. Along with Gambhir, Yusuf Pathan was also part of India's 2011 World Cup winning team while Robin Uthappa was the leading run-scorer last year with 660. In terms of overseas talent, Kolkata boast Sunil Narine, Morne Morkel, Johan Botha, Andre Russell, Pat Cummins, Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib-al-Hasan and Dutchman Ryan ten Doeschate. ONE TO WATCH: It's rare for India to produce fast bowlers with genuine pace, but they have one in UMESH YADAV. Kolkata will be looking for Yadav to combine with Morkel and Narine as part of a fearsome bowling attack. Sunil Narine, pictured in action for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2012 Indian Premier League. MUMBAI INDIANS. The team that once featured the great Sachin Tendulkar finally won the IPL in 2013, and they have an excellent chance to lift their second title this year. In Rohit Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha and Parthiv Patel, Mumbai have a strong core of Indian talent, but it is their overseas game-winners that makes them dangerous. Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga is the highest wicket-taker in tournament history with 119, and he is joined by Kieron Pollard, Aaron Finch, Corey Anderson and Josh Hazlewood. After losing in the eliminator against Chennai last year, the Mumbai Indians will once again expect to reach the play-offs and mount a serious challenge for the title. ONE TO WATCH: The demon bowler that is MALINGA has made a habit of cleaning up batsmen in the IPL and was key in their success in 2013. He will once again lead this bowling attack. Mumbai Indians batsman Rohit Sharma pictured in action for India against Bangladesh at the World Cup. 2008: Rajasthan Royals. 2009: Deccan Chargers (defunct) 2010: Chennai Super Kings. 2011: Chennai Super Kings. 2012: Kolkata Knight Riders. 2013: Mumbai Indians. 2014: Kolkata Knight Riders. RAJASTHAN ROYALS. Since Shane Warne's side won the inaugural IPL in 2008, the Rajasthan Royals have only made the play-offs on one occasion since. Rajasthan's short history has been eventful to say the lease. They were expelled by the BCCI and then reinstated in 2010 and were also rocked by the spot-fixing scandal that saw former Test match bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth banned for life. This year's Royals team features a strong Australian presence in captain Shane Watson, Steve Smith and James Faulkner as well as New Zealand seamer Tim Southee. Their Indian talent lacks star quality, though, with Ajinkya Rahane, Stuart Binny and Dhawal Kulkarni the only men who have forced their way into the national side. ONE TO WATCH: Australian SMITH has enjoyed a summer of dominating India and was instrumental in his country winning the World Cup. Smith is a dangerous player with the bat, can hold up his end with the ball and is also one of the best fielders in the tournament. Steve Smith will look to continue his excellent form into the Indian Premier League with Rajasthan. Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, pictured in 2009, is a part owner of the Rajasthan Royals. ROYAL CHALLENGERS BANGALORE. Any batting order that contains Chris Gayle, AB de Villers and Kohli has half a chance, but it has been Bangalore's bowling that has held them back in recent years. Bangalore have never won the IPL and have missed out on the play-offs altogether in the last three years. The Royal Challengers paid big money in the auction to pick up Dinesh Karthik (\u00a31.17million) in an attempt to shake off their underachievers tag. But news that World Cup player of the tournament Mitchell Starc will miss the start of the IPL will hurt their bowling attack. ONE TO WATCH: Any of their big three batsmen really, but DE VILLIERS is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket for his stunning range of shots. Virat Kohli and Chris Gayle pictured playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2012 tournament. South African AB de Villiers is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket. SUNRISERS HYDERABAD. The newest team in the Indian Premier League, the Sunrisers Hyderabad are set to embark on their third campaign having been founded in 2013 and replaced the Deccan Chargers. The Sunrisers will be led up front by the explosive opening duo of David Warner and Shikhar Dhawan and their middle order will feature New Zealander Kane Williamson and English duo Ravi Bopara and Eoin Morgan. Hyderabad also landed Kevin Pietersen in the auction for what looked like a bargain of \u00a3205,000 after he was released by the Delhi Daredevils, but the 34-year-old will not feature in the orange shirt unless they make the play-offs. Pietersen reached the agreement with the Sunrisers in order to return to Surrey in an attempt to resurrect his England career, but the play-offs take place during the same week as England's first Test against New Zealand at Lord's. The Sunrisers also boast a a strong bowling line-up with foreign stars Dale Steyn and Trent Boult supported by Indian internationals Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. ONE TO WATCH: Hyderabad's strength is up top with captain Warner and DHAWAN. The Indian batsman scored two centuries at the recent World Cup and, like Warner, has the power to take the game away from the opposition if he's there for a while. Eoin Morgan will look to move on quickly from England's miserable World Cup when he plays in the IPL. Kevin Pietersen, here playing for Delhi in 2012, will join Hyderabad if they make the play-offs.\n","right_summary":"IPL 2015 to begin in Kolkata on Wednesday, April 8.

The couple's wedding venue is\u00a02km outside the tiny town of Eugowra, in New South Wales' central west region. But on Saturday, the wedding venue was locked up and deserted as guests instead paid tribute to Ms Scott at her memorial service which was held 275km and three hours' drive away from Eat Your Greens.

The planned wedding venue was locked up and the car park was empty and silent, with only the sound of crickets and toads in the nearby countryside. The grounds surrounding the premises were immaculate, and in the middle there was a hallway of trees that looked like an aisle. You could imagine guests chatting happily around the grounds. The only sign that Stephanie's wedding was due to take place there was a touching memorial at the venue's entrance, which was made up of flower bouquets and yellow balloons. 'Generally the place is lively with people enjoying themselves on a Saturday night. There's always something going on there. I was wondering why it was so quiet,' one neighbour said. Tributes to Ms Scott were left at the gates of her wedding venue. Her big day was supposed to take place on Saturday. But it was pointless to think of what could have been - where there should have been laughter there was now only an eerie stillness.

The popular teacher had been reported missing since Easter Sunday as police found her body on Friday - the day before her wedding. On Thursday, Ms Scott's fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley visited the makeshift memorial erected outside the school his partner of five years had taught English and drama. The popular high school teacher was honoured with cards, flowers, balloons, candles, and pictures as students from the school, along with friends, family, and strangers visited to remember the 26-year-old. Many of Ms Scott's friends and family had travelled from interstate and overseas for the wedding, but stayed for the memorial instead, in the wake of the news that police had discovered a body on Friday night they believed to be that of the 26-year-old. Detective Superintendent Michael Rowan, local area commander at Griffith, said that the body found just metres from the road in Cocoparra National Park, in the Riverina region of NSW, had been burned. The remains of the body have been taken to Glebe infirmary for further forensics. Police also said that a gasoline can had been found at the site. Police have charged school cleaner Vincent Stanford, 24, with the 26-year-old teacher's murder and will allege Stanford killed Ms Scott at some point between 11am and 7.20pm on Sunday, before dumping her car and body.

{"document":"A Scottish castle commandeered by Winston Churchill to help prepare troops for the D-Day landings has gone on sale for \u00a31.75million. The 19th century Castle Toward, near Dunoon, was used to ready soldiers for landing at a beach and was commissioned as HMS Brontosaurus in 1942. Overlooking the Clyde estuary and with easy access to the sloping shoreline, the castle was deemed an ideal training ground for thousands of British troops. Soldiers practised beach landings - complete with bombs, smokescreens and strafing fighters - jumping from landing craft and clambering up the beach in preparation for the events of June 6, 1944, in Normandy. For sale: Castle Toward, near Dunoon, which played a crucial but little-known role in defeating the Nazis, has gone on the market for \u00a31.75m. Training ground:\u00a0Overlooking the Clyde estuary and with easy access to the sloping shoreline, the castle was used as a training base for D-Day. Danger: The training at the grounds was very realistic and incredibly demanding - many servicemen were killing during exercises. Allied soldiers would spend a week of intensive training at the castle, which included swimming in full kit and daily exercises on the surrounding hills. Brontosaurus was visited by both Churchill and Supreme Allied Commander Lord Mountbatten during this time. The training was so realistic and demanding that many servicemen were killed in accidents. The castle's rich military history is still clear to see. One room is named after Churchill and the foundations of the huts built to accommodate visiting troops still stand in parts of the grounds. Preparations: The grounds of the 19th century castle on the Cowal Peninsula in Argyll and Bute was used to ready troops for D-Day. Deep waters: Swimming training saw the forces jump off the pier and they then had to wade to shore in full military gear. Army base: Troops were stationed at the castle, where they trained off the coast of Scotland, in preparation for the D-Day landings of 1944. Camp: With easy access to the sloping shoreline, Castle Toward was a perfect place to train troops in amphibious warfare. Historic: The D-Day landings on June 6, 1944,\u00a0led to the liberation of France from Nazi control, and contributed to an Allied victory in the war. Timings: The Normandy landings were originally scheduled to take place in May - then postponed until June and put off again at the last minute for 24 hours due to bad weather. Across the UK, troops took part in various military exercises in preparation for D-Day. In late 1943 the war cabinet had agreed to the building of an assault training centre on the south Devon coast, and 3,000 civilians in six villages were ordered to leave their homes. The first large training exercises - on the south Devon coast at Slapton Sands \u2013 revealed communications problems, lack of mission comprehension, poor crisis management abilities and a general sense of chaos. On April 28, 1944, 749 US soldiers and sailors died after three ships involved in a training exercise were ambushed by German torpedo. Exercise Tiger was one of the biggest full-scale rehearsals before D-day, involving all 23,000 US soldiers who were planning to land on the Normandy beach codenamed Utah. Slapton Sands had been chosen because of its similarity to the French beach. Apart from the Devon and Scotland coastline, training also took place at Camp Gordon Johnston near Carrabelle, Florida. Mr Jepson, of the Combined Operations Association, said the troops stationed at the castle were planning for a return to mainland Europe. He said it was essential the different branches of the forces - army, navy and air - learned to work together for the return to France. He said: 'They had to start from scratch and start planning for the return to France. They started the combined service centres where they planned the actual landings. 'Of course they had very little to start off with. They developed various crafts and weapons.' Speaking about the conditions for the troops at Brontosaurus, he explained: 'They were under a lot of pressure. Sadly there were a lot of accidents and a lot of people were killed. 'With the ramp down they would jump into what they thought was shallow water and some drowned.' 'Swimming training would see them jump off the pier and swim to shore in full kit.' He said the RAF would at times fly over the Scottish beaches dropping bombs and smoke screens. 'It had to be as realistic as possible,' he said. 'It must have been an amazing site with the landing crafts, ships and tanks coming and going.' Talking about Castle Toward he said: 'It was ideal where it was. It's a beautiful building and historically important.' Castle Toward was built in 1820 by\u00a0Kirkman Finlay, a former Lord Provost of Glasgow, as his family's country house. Following its use by the Allied Forces, the estate was bought\u00a0by the Corporation of Glasgow in 1946 and was used as an educational facility. Its ownership passed to Argyll and Bute Council in 1996 after local government reorganisation and the authority has been trying to sell the estate for the past few years. It has only been put on the open market after plans for a community buyout were rejected by the council after it only offered \u00a3850,000. The castle includes 25 bedrooms, six reception rooms and extensive grounds with stunning views over the Cowal peninsula near Dunoon. On the market: The castle, which is being sold by estate agents,\u00a0Baird Lumsden, contains 12 shower rooms and an observation tower. Historic: The castle offers stunning views\u00a0over the Cowal peninsula near Dunoon and is set within 125 acres of land. Picturesque:\u00a0The property enjoys fine views over the Clydeestuary towards the Isles of Bute, Arran and Cumbrae.\n","right_summary":"19th century Castle Toward, near Dunoon, was used to ready soldiers for the D-Day landings in World War Two.

{"document":"An Italian ice cream man pursued his older rival in his van and then punched him through the driver's window in a turf war over 'stealing' customers from a new housing development. The row broke out between Andrea Trunfio, 36, and Mario Bretti, 64, after the former allegedly tried to muscle in on Mr Bretti's patch. A court heard how the pair clashed as they drove their vans away from the site on a scorching day in July last year. Mr Bretti said his competitor chased him along a busy road before cutting him off at a junction and blocking him with his van. He then got out and threw a flurry of punches at the 64-year-old through the driver's window. Pursued: Mr Bretti, 64, was chased by his younger rival Andrea Trunfio over an argument over a disputed site. The incident took place around the new Ridgeway Farm housing development on July 22 last year, when temperatures reached 25 degrees during a spell of sunny weather. Describing what happened, Mr Bretti said: 'I have been doing this for 45 years, since I was just 18 years old. On July 22, I got beaten up by another ice cream man. 'He decided to follow me on Thamesdown Drive in the middle of the road. He was going fast through the traffic lights, and when they went red I had to stop. He blocked me with his van so I couldn\u2019t get away. 'He came up to the van and punching me threatened to kill me, saying he had claimed the building site as his area. 'I was selling there because Sparcells is my area. He was very aggressive and started punching me several times and said he would come to my home. In the end I drove away to get away from him.' Mr Bretti said he felt very dizzy and frightened after the altercation and went straight to the police station, while Trunfio did a U-turn and sped off. Dispute:\u00a0Mr Bretti said he felt very dizzy and frightened after the altercation and went straight to the police. Trunfio denied common assault and claimed Mr Bretti had threatened to kill his family and burn his van if he went back to the disputed site. Speaking through an intepreter, he claimed he had seen Mr Bretti at the site that day and his older rival had beckoned him to follow afterwards. He said when they pulled up at the traffic lights, Mr Bretti grabbed his arm before rolling up the window to trap it. He also told the court had sold ice creams in Swindon for ten years and had been at the housing development for two or three months before the incident. He also claimed there had been prior arrangements which meant Mr Bretti would no longer sell at the building site. Trunfio, from Swindon, told the magistrates' court in Chippenham, Wiltshire: 'In our community, usually each person has an area. There is no law to say you can't go to certain places. 'I am not a violent person, but when you have an agreement and someone breaks it, it is like you are being taken for a ride. 'I am an easy person and do not argue with people. If I had hit him it would have been like hitting my own father.' Disputed site: The two ice cream men argued about who had ownership of the new Ridgeway Farm housing development (pictured above), in Swindon. Blocked: Mr Bretti was stopped on his way out of the housing development by Trunfio, who then hit him. But witnesses to the incident said Trunfio got out and attacked his older rival after driving madly after him. Sarah Miller, who saw the confrontation from her car, said: 'I saw him (Trunfio) getting out and coming to the one at the back. 'He didn't look particularly angry until he tried to open the door of the second van. 'He was jumping up and down and trying to go after the other ice cream man. I could see his fists going in and out of the window. 'He got back into his van and carried on shouting through his serving hatch.' She added: 'I was quite shocked, and very disappointed. I thought if my children had seen that they would have been scared to go to an ice cream van again.' Magistrates found Trunfio guilty and he was given a 12-month community order with 80 hours of unpaid work and \u00a3650 costs and ordered to pay \u00a375 compensation to Mr Bretti.\n","right_summary":"Row broke out between Andrea Trunfio, 36, and Mario Bretti, 64, last July.

{"document":"Chelsea match-winner Cesc Fabregas hailed a vital win after his late goal gave his side a 1-0 victory over QPR at Loftus Road. The game looked to be heading for a stalemate before Fabregas' 88th minute shot - their first on target in the game - found its way past Rob Green. The win moved Jose Mourinho's men seven points clear at the top of the table and Fabregas admitted it was an important goal. Midfielder Cesc Fabregas runs away in celebration having scored a vital winner in the 88th minute. 'It was vital. We know that we are playing for the most important trophy of the season,' the midfielder told Sky Sports. 'We're there in first place and we want to continue that.' He also paid tribute to the performance of QPR, saying: 'They were very difficult to play but we showed great mentality and never gave up in the difficult moments.' Cesc Fabregas wore a  protective mask during Chelsea's clash with QPR after breaking his nose last week. Cesc Fabregas' low strike, Chelsea's first shot on target, was enough to secure the win at Loftus Road. Chelsea striker Didier Drogba struggled to impose his game on a resolute QPR defence on Sunday. Blues striker Dider Drogba added: 'We had belief. We always play until the end. It was a tough game but the good thing with this team is we always play to the end.' Mourinho knew the win moved his side one step closer to a fifth league title, despite them having to work hard for it. 'Our situation was very positive. One point would be one less point we need, but the reality is that three points is always three points and one less match we need to win so is a very important step in a very important match,' he said. Nemanja Matic hugs his goalscoring team-mate Fabregas after the final whistle at Loftus Road. 'It was a very difficult match where the best quality was to control the game very well and stop our opponents scoring. 'They are a team that can score goals and have dangerous, attacking players so our best quality in the game was to keep calm and try to play against a team that was very well organised defensively and did a fantastic job,' added Mourinho. 'After that you have lots of times in the season when you win points or lose points in the end of the game, and we won two points in the last two minutes.'

{"document":"Audio has surfaced of Michael Slager, 33, laughing and admitting to experiencing a rush of adrenaline in the minutes following the shooting. Audio has surfaced of the cop who killed Walter Scott laughing and admitting to experiencing a rush of adrenaline in the minutes following the deadly shooting in South Carolina earlier this month. Michael Slager, 33, can be heard laughing nervously while talking with a senior officer. The conversation was picked up by the dashcam in the officer's patrol car following the incident in North Charleston on April 5. The dashcam footage showing Scott, 50, a Coast Guard veteran, being pulled over for a broken tail light just minutes before Slager shot him, was released to the media on Thursday. The camera continued to record for another hour and a recording of the audio feed, including the conversation between Slager and a senior officer, was obtained by The Guardian. 'By the time you get home, it would probably be a good idea to kind of jot down your thoughts on what happened,' the senior officer said. 'You know, once the adrenaline quits pumping.' 'It's pumping,' Slager said, laughing. The senior officer replied: 'Oh yeah. Oh yeah.' The senior officer told Slager during the conversation to go home and relax, assuring him that he would not have to answer questions about the shooting for days. Scott was shot five times in the back as he ran away from the traffic stop. The father of four's death has sparked a nationwide debate about police brutality and bias against black people after a witness published video contradicting the police account of the event. Warning: Graphic Content Below. Scroll down for audio and video. Slager can be heard laughing nervously while talking with a senior officer. The conversation was picked up by the dashcam in the officer's patrol car following the incident in North Charleston on April 5. Slager, 33, who is white, said that he felt 'threatened' by Scott, who is black, during a confrontation over his Taser, but video shows the civilian running away before being shot. The dashcam also recorded a cellphone call that Slager received about five minutes before his conversation with the senior officer. 'Hey. Hey, everything's OK, OK?' Slager said, after an iPhone ringtone was heard. Slager then appears to say: 'He grabbed my taser, yeah. Yeah, he was running from me.' His wife, Jamie, is eight months pregnant with their first child. Slager was fired from the North Charleston police and charged with murder on Tuesday. A group of black attorneys have called for the second officer connected to the fatal shooting to be arrested. National Bar Association officials said that Officer Clarence Habersham, 37, who was the second policeman to arrive at the dead man's body after Slager, should be fired and prosecuted for filing a false report. The National Bar Association is calling for North Chareston officer Clarence Habersham, 37 (right) to be arrested for falsifying a report about the actions of  Michael Slager, 33 (left), during the death of Walter Scott. Habersham (right) was the second office to arrive at the body of Scott, 50, and did not report Slager's actions leading up to the shooting. Habersham, who approached the body after Slager went to go grab the Taser that fell, can be seen examining Scott. Slager then drops the Taser next to the dead body in the presence of Habersham. Habersham then used his radio to report that Scott had\u00a0gunshot wounds to his chest, right side, and backside. However, the black officer gave a two-sentence supplemental report and said that he tried to render aid to the body, which no one in the video does. Officers in the video are seen walking around and checking the pulse of the body. Sergeant James Gann wrote in his report that he helped Habersham administer first aid and CPR. On April 4, 2015 I Officer Habersham responded to the empty Lot behind Mega Pawn in reference to the above incident. I (Habersham) attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and directing the best route for EMS and fire to take to get to the victim faster. Video released after Slager's account into the death shows Scott (left) running away from the traffic stop when he is shot. Mourners have placed flowers at a memorial to the veteran (right) over the past week. Slager said after the incident that he 'felt threatened' by Scott, though video shot by Feidin Santana contradicts his report. Feidin Santana, who filmed a widely circulated video of the incident, said he did not any officers giving Scott CPR. The National Bar Association, the country's oldest group of black lawyers, said that Habersham 'deliberately left material facts out of his report' and left it 'incomplete'. The group said it was 'outraged' by the incident and that any other officer of the seven that quickly arrived on the scene should be indicted if they filed a false report. Police are interviewing all officers involved, a police source told CBS News. Chief Eddie Driggers said that he would not comment because the investigation is ongoing. Habersham was accused of excessive force by another black South Carolina resident, Sheldon Williams, 47. POLICE VERSION. Police officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday. He said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light. He said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager. The officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement. According to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott. At that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said. He added that his actions were in line with procedure. Police then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down.\u00a0He took my Taser.' His department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim. WHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS. Slager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back. The footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body. Footage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him. It is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse. A black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid. They are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim. Relatives of Scott say their goodbyes to him on Saturday at a funeral that was was so widely attended that hundreds were left outside. Williams, who has multiple criminal convictions, said that he was pinned to the ground, handcuffed and had his face stomped on during a 2011 arrest. He said he did not resist arrest. Scott was laid to rest on Saturday, his casket draped in an American flag and accompanied by his distraught mother. So many people came to the service that hundreds were left waiting outside. US senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman Jim Clyburn (D-SC), state senator Marlon Kimpson, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, and Elder James Johnson of the National Action Network all attended. Slager is being held without bail and faces punishments as serious as the death penalty if convicted. Judy Scott, the mother of Walter, leaves the funeral for her son in Charleston, South Carolina. The service was also attended by a number of the state's politcians. Scott, who was remembered as a beloved father, had his coffin draped in an American flag during Saturday's funeral ceremony.\n","right_summary":"Audio has surfaced of Michael Slager, 33, laughing and admitting to experiencing a rush of adrenaline in the minutes following the shooting.

{"document":"The town of Reading may have been swept up in FA Cup euphoria, but Steve Clarke has instructed his players to approach this weekend's semi-final like any other day at work. It has been 88 years since the Royals last reached the last-four juncture and the SkyBet Championship side travel to Wembley facing the unenviable task of overcoming in-form Arsenal. Reading are striving to make the FA Cup final for the first time in their history, leading to excitement understandably building in Berkshire - if not the club's Hogwood Park training ground. Reading overcame League One side Bradford with a 3-0 replay win to progress to FA Cup semi-final. Clarke, a winner as player and coach at Chelsea, has told his players not to get caught up in the occasion, with progression the only objective. 'I think when you go through to semi-finals, the only way to enjoy it is to win the game,' the Reading manager said. 'You can't go to Wembley and play the occasion. It is not about playing the occasion, we're playing Arsenal. 'For us, it has to be a day of work. We have to go there focused only on what happens on the pitch. The Royals face Premier League giants Arsenal in crunch clash on Saturday at Wembley. 'The supporters can go and enjoy the day, that's their little reward for a cup run. 'For us, it is to go there with a mentality that we are there to do a job and if we do that right we can go through.' Clarke is confident his players can make history on Saturday, even though few outsiders share his faith. One bookmaker has them at 14\/1 to win and Reading's manager accepts they will have to play the 'perfect game' to overcome an Arsenal side on the back of eight straight league wins. It has been 88 years since Reading last made an appearance in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. 'They look strong, well-balanced,' Clarke said. 'They're winning games. 'They have terrific players. Great problems for us to solve. 'Maybe they have left their run too late to catch Chelsea at the top but certainly a good chance to finish the season strongly.' Reading have no fresh injury concerns ahead of the semi-final, with Pavel Pogrebnyak fit after a slight calf complaint ruled him out of Tuesday's 1-0 loss to table-topping Bournemouth. Steve Clarke was appointed Reading manager in December 2014 to replace Nigel Adkins. Clarke felt defeat was harsh on his side, stretching a run of winless matches to five since winning the quarter-final replay against Bradford. 'Cup competitions, one-off games, we seem to have approached it with a little bit more freedom, a little less nervousness, if you like,' the Royals boss said. 'I think the league campaign has been disappointing. There is sort of a feeling of doom and gloom around the league campaign this year which is never nice. Reading have struggled in the Championship but have brought FA Cup euphoria to the town with their great run. 'I think that is reflected in the game (against Bournemouth), when we are knocking at the door in the last 10 minutes and knocking on the door very, very much. 'Bournemouth, because they're on a winning run, know how to get over the line and win at the moment. 'We're struggling in the league a little bit to find a way to win games, whereas in the cup we've been good. 'We've known how to win the cup games so hopefully that continues on Saturday.'\n","right_summary":"Reading face  Arsenal in FA Cup semi-final on Saturday at Wembley.

{"document":"Celtic manager Ronny Deila will try to persuade Jason Denayer and Manchester City to extend the centre-back's loan deal next season - but Hearts captain Danny Wilson is also among his defensive targets. Denayer made his full international debut in Belgium's 1-0 European Championship qualifying victory in Israel on Tuesday night, coming on as a substitute after Vincent Kompany was sent off. The 19-year-old also faces competition from Kompany at City, and Deila would welcome another season-long loan arrangement. Celtic want to keep Manchester City defender Jason Denayer (left) on loan for another season. Hearts captain Danny Wilson is another defensive target for Celtic manager Ronny Deila. But, with Denayer due to spend pre-season with his parent club in a bid to prove himself, there is no guarantee he will return, and certainly not in time for Celtic's Champions League qualifying campaign beginning in mid-July. So Deila confirmed he would look to sign a centre-back and responded to reports that former Rangers player Wilson was among his list of potential targets. 'That is one of many names we are talking about but there is nothing serious in that,' Deila said. 'But he's a good player.' Deila, who spent last week watching Norway training before their 5-1 defeat in Croatia, added: 'Jason is going back to Manchester City after the season to have a pre-season and we will see if we can get him back or not. That is something we want, but we have to co-operate with City. 'But I think it's good for him to stay here because hopefully we will get Champions League qualification and that will make him even more experienced. 'Jason is ambitious - he wants to play at the highest level he can. But it's playing that is the most important thing, and playing at Manchester City is very, very hard. If not, I think Celtic is a good club for him.' Celtic boss Ronny Deila has confirmed that he will ask Manchester City if he can keep Denayer next season. Denayer rises highest to score against Aberdeen at Celtic Park at the beginning of last month. Celtic were involved in another loan deal this week when 18-year-old midfielder Liam Henderson joined Rosenborg until the summer. Henderson has made 22 first-team appearances, but competition has increased recently with the signings of Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven. 'Rosenborg called me and asked if we had a midfielder that could be available and Liam Henderson is a very, very talented player and he needs games,' Deila said. 'This was a good move for him. We have a lot of options in midfield and he can play until July 1 and get as much experience as possible. It's a big club as well - the biggest club in Norway, high expectations there. This will give him more experience as a player and a person. 'He was quite keen and that's what good about Liam - he is so ambitious. He really wants to play and develop all the time. 'He saw this as a very good move for him and I made it quite clear that it's not as if I don't want him - it's just because I think it's good for his development. If I was selfish, I would keep him here.' Denayer, pictured celebrating a goal in August last year, is hoping to break into Manchester City's first-team. When asked if more Scottish players should experience playing abroad, Deila said: 'Abroad or not, I'm not sure what is best, but you have to learn a different culture, different ways of playing football, which is positive, and also learning a language and getting away from a safe environment.

Amy says her new range is full of smart workwear with a 'fun spring edge', as well as skater dresses her fans can wear to BBQs and play around with the kids in. The former TOWIE star says her garments are designed for the woman wanting to embrace wearable catwalk trends and 'definitely' for real women. 'I design for real women - not photoshopped fashion models,' she said. 'I love curves.

{"document":"An Amnesty International report is calling for authorities to address the number of attacks on women's rights activists in Afghanistan. The report, entitled \"Their Lives on the Line,\" examines the persecution of activists and other champions of women's rights not only by the Taliban and tribal warlords, but also by government officials. Its publication is timely. The brutal murder of Farkhunda, a young woman in Afghanistan, whose body was burnt and callously chucked into a river in Kabul, shocked the world. Accused of burning pages from the Muslim holy book, the Quran, many protested the 27-year-old's innocence. But what also made international headlines was the fact that for the first time in history, women in Afghanistan became pallbearers, hoisting the victim's coffin on their shoulders draped with headscarves, under the gazes of men; unreservedly sobbing and shouting messages of women's solidarity as they marched along the streets. In a country ranked in 2011 by a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll as the most dangerous place in the world for women, this feminist act seemed perilous. Latest figures suggest they were risking their lives to be heard. In 2013, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) released statistics that showed the number of women killed in the country had increased by 20% from the previous year, although the number of civilian victims had decreased, said Amnesty in the report. The Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General in Afghanistan at the time, Jan Kubis, told the U.N. Security Council that \"the majority (of women killed) is linked to domestic violence, tradition, culture of the country. \"Women activists have been deliberately targeted.\" And according to the human rights group, little support has come from those in power. \"The Afghan government has done very little to protect them,\" Amnesty's Afghanistan researcher, Horia Mosadiq, tells CNN. \"Perpetrators almost always walk free, and threats reported by women rights defenders are often simply ignored. \"Many women defenders we spoke to said that even when they received some protection from authorities, it was often significantly less than what male counterparts or colleagues were afforded.\" During the attack on Farkhunda, \"many eyewitnesses have testified that police officers stood idly by while this woman was being lynched and killed,\" says Mosadiq. Twenty-six people were arrested and thirteen police officials suspended in connection with the attack, but she argues that this is insufficient. \"Suspending police officers is not enough, those who failed in their duty must also be held to account -- anything less will just encourage further mob violence.\" But what is striking is the resilience of the activists, who continue their work despite their lives being on the line. \"It was a remarkable moment,\" says Mosadiq, recalling the female protesters at Farkhunda's funeral. \"Unlike anything I have seen in my decades of campaigning for women's rights in our country.\" Selay Ghaffer, 32, is a women's rights activist and spokesperson for the Solidarity Party of Afghanistan -- a small but outspoken political party based in Kabul and twenty provinces that fights for issues such as democracy, social justice and women's rights. The party was the first to be banned in the country for accusing Afghan leaders and commanders of war crimes and demanding that they be brought to justice. Taking part in Farkhunda's funeral and protests against her death, she tells CNN that despite the onslaught of violence against Afghan women over the years, this was the worst case. But the opportunity was taken to deliver a clear message. \"So the women of Afghanistan showed that we will not keep silent anymore... And we are not ready to accept more brutality and violence against women,\" said Ghaffer. \"So this is why we decided to carry the dead body of Farkhunda on our own shoulders and show to the world that not only men can do it and somehow broke the traditionalism that (a) man has to do this job.\" Surprisingly, she says that male onlookers supported their mission, although they are in the minority overall in the country. \"Men (at the funeral), they said you have to do this, because this is how you can change the hatred in Afghanistan. \"Without men, it is not possible for women to get their rights,\" she says. \"So these men and women were working together. But at the same time, women need to step forward for their rights.\" Mosadiq says the fight for women's rights was established a while ago. \"Women's activism in Afghanistan is nothing new -- the women's rights movement has grown substantially since 2001, and has fought for and achieved some very significant gains. \"These gains are under threat now, however, and some are even rolled back. It's essential that the government and its international partners do not allow this to happen.\" Ghaffer herself has been subject to threats because of her work, received through emails and phone calls, at her home and office. But she says she knew what she was getting herself into. \"I knew it wasn't an easy task. There might be many challenges and you have to lose your life when you are going and struggling for your rights. \"As a woman, I want to struggle more (for my rights), I want to have more people around me, to struggle with me.\" Mosadiq says it is too soon to talk about a revolution, although the response to Farkhunda's killing, from both men and women, has been a \"silver lining.\" Ghaffer, however, believes this is the beginning of an uprising -- but she says it needs to keep moving. Interestingly, it was a man in her life that motivated her to fight. \"I must say strongly that it was my father (who inspired me), who is not any more with me, because he... died three months ago,\" she says. \"He always told me that women always suffered in this country,\" she says, her voice overcome with emotion. \"And you have to struggle for your rights. Because in this traditional, patriarchal society, nobody will give these rights (to) you.\" She realizes how lucky she is, she adds, in a society where she has witnessed men -- fathers and husbands -- oppressing women as opposed to being their role models. Ghaffer maintains that silence is an injustice to women, not least to the victim of the recent, horrific mob violence. \"So if I should not do it, if another sister is not doing it, then who will do it? Who will get the rights for us? We have to struggle for it. \"If we keep our silence, more Farkhundas will be killed in this country.\"\n","right_summary":"An Amnesty International report calls for attacks on women's rights activists in Afghanistan to be investigated.

A recent Amnesty International report commended their efforts and called for greater cooperation between the government and activists in the future.

Although much work remains to be done to ensure women's rights are protected, the outpouring of support from both genders has been a promising sign."}
{"document":"He may be a warrior in the ring, but Manny Pacquaio showed his humble side outside of it once more with his latest Instagram post. The 36-year-old is gearing up for his $300million welterweight showdown with Floyd Mayweather on May 2 - in what is set to become the richest bout in boxing history. But the Philipine star took time out of his preparation to thank American film director Spike Lee and Tito Mikey for their support so far. Manny Pacquiao took to Instagram to thank Spike Lee and Tito Mikey ahead of his bout vs Floyd Mayweather. The 36-year-old also posted a photo thanking NBA legend Karl Malone (centre left) for visiting him at the gym. 'Hello to all my fans in New York and thank you to Spike Lee and Tito Mikey for supporting Team Pacquiao,' Pacquaio said via Instagram on Thursday. 'I hope to see you soon. God bless.' The duo are just the latest to show their support for the 'Pac-man' ahead of his fight against Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas next month. Former two-time NBA MVP and 14-time All-Star Karl Malone is another who appears to be behind the camp of the southpaw boxer. Later on Thursday, Pacquaio took to Instagram again to post a picture with the 51-year-old at his Wild Card gym base in Los Angeles. Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, believes his man is ready to beat Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2. Accompanied with the caption: 'Thank you Karl Malone for visiting me today. God Bless you and your family,' the pair are all smiles alongside trainer Freddie Roach. And speaking earlier in the week, Roach believes that his fighter has a better chance of beating Mayweather now than he did in 2010. Asked whether the 2010 or 2015 version of Pacquiao would have a better chance of victory against the unbeaten Mayweather, Roach told boxingscene.com : 'That is an interesting question because there are obviously trade-offs between the two versions of Manny. But I am convinced that the 2015 model is the more formidable fighter for a few reasons. 'Back in 2010, Manny was still growing into a welterweight. His first two welterweight fights were against Oscar De La Hoya in 2008 and Miguel Cotto in 2009 where he only weighed 142 and 144 pounds respectively, and in between he dropped down to 138 to fight Ricky Hatton. 'Floyd has been campaining as a welterweight since 2005 and weighed 150 in his fight against De La Hoya so that might have given Floyd an advantage. I still like Manny's chances in that fight but I think the Manny of today has a lot more in his favour. Pacquiao is better equipped to beat Mayweather now than he was in 2010, according to his trainer Roach. Mayweather is looking to extend his 47-fight unbeaten streak when he meets Pacquiao next month. 'In 2010 the two-year age difference between the fighters was not significant to either, but that's not true today. Floyd at 38 is doing things he didn't do in the past. Floyd is a defensive genius but he has always depended on his legs to perform and you can see now that his legs do not have the same spring or fluidness of his earlier years. Mayweather remains the bookmakers' favourite for the $300million mega-fight next month but Roach is adamant that Pacquiao is primed to cause an upset. 'The 2015 version of Manny is more mature, smarter and less reckless than the 2010 version,' said Roach. 'He will be treating the ring like a chess board anticipating Floyd's moves - ready to cut him off and attack every time he creates an opening. 'I have all the confidence in the world that Manny is going to knock Floyd out on May 2.' The pair will go head-to-head in a $300million mega-fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2.\n","right_summary":"Manny Pacquiao fights Floyd Mayweather at the MGM Grand on May 2.

{"document":"Atlanta (CNN)Federal marshals have arrested Scott Kelley, a fugitive accused of kidnapping who was featured on CNN's \"The Hunt.\" Kelley, 50, was taken into custody at the Atlanta airport Wednesday after arriving on a flight from Costa Rica, Deputy U.S. Marshal Jamie Berry said. \"It was time to come home,\" Kelley told People magazine about his decision to return to the United States. Kelley has been wanted since 2004, accused of noncustodial kidnapping and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. His wife, Genevieve Kelley, who's charged with the same crimes, turned herself in to authorities last year, just a few months after the case was featured on CNN's \"The Hunt.\" Her trial is scheduled to start next month. The couple is accused of leaving New Hampshire, kidnapping Genevieve Kelley's daughter, Mary Nunes, and beginning a life on the lam when she was 8 years old. At the time, the child's father, Mark Nunes, had full custody rights. The search for the three spanned the United States, Canada and Central and South America. It ended on Monday, when Scott Kelley and Mary Nunes entered the U.S. Consulate in Costa Rica and requested passports so they could return to the United States. The consulate notified U.S. Marshals, Berry said, and when Kelley and Nunes flew to Atlanta on Wednesday investigators were waiting for them. Mary Nunes, now 19, was interviewed by investigators at the Atlanta airport to ensure her health and safety and then allowed to continue to her final destination, Berry said. Previously, authorities had said her whereabouts were unknown. CNN New Hampshire affiliate WMUR reported that the daughter plans to testify at her mother's trial. In a statement released through a private investigator he's hired in the case, her father said that he was thrilled to learn Mary is safe. \"We love Mary and are overjoyed that she is alive and back in the US. Our hearts and home are open to her, and we will do everything we can to insure she remains safe and healthy,\" Mark Nunes said in a statement. \"We remain concerned about her emotional and physical well-being. We look forward to the day our family is finally reunited.\" Kelley's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Before allegedly fleeing the country, Genevieve Kelley had accused her ex-husband of abusing their child. Investigators found no basis for the accusations and no charges were filed. On a Facebook page defending her, supporters of the mother say she did what any parent would do under the same circumstances. Photos on the page show her standing with friends holding signs that say, \"Justice for Gen! Children need protection.\" Wayne Rioux, who was then the police chief of Whitefield, New Hampshire, told \"The Hunt\" that a video Genevieve and Scott Kelley made, intended to prove their abuse allegations, aroused his suspicions. Rioux watched the tape for \"any evidence of wrongdoing by Mark Nunes.\" \"But throughout the tape all I saw was this bizarre, strange conduct by the mother,\" Rioux said, \"who was absolutely brainwashing the daughter and trying to get the daughter to say things against her daddy.\" Attorney Alan Rosenfeld has argued that Genevieve Kelley had no other option than running away with her daughter, after a court-appointed guardian and social service agencies had said they didn't believe the abuse allegations. \"Simply put, there was no lawful alternative to provide safety for this child,\" he said earlier this year, according to WMUR. Earlier this year, Brazilian police tracked down Victor Arden Barnard, another fugitive who'd been featured on \"The Hunt.\" The 53-year-old American pastor is accused of dozens of sexual assaults in Minnesota. Last year, the same day Genevieve Kelley was arrested, authorities in Texas announced that in an unrelated case, remains found were confirmed to be those of another fugitive featured on the program, Kevin Patrick Stoeser. Stoeser, a U.S. soldier who was dishonorably discharged, pleaded guilty in 2003 to child sexual assault and child pornography charges and was sentenced to 13 years behind bars. Remains of Shane Miller, another suspect featured on the \"The Hunt,\" were found last year. And Charles Mozdir, another suspect who was profiled on the show, was killed in a gunbattle with authorities. CNN's Tricia Escobedo and Slma Shelbayah contributed to this report.\n","right_summary":"Scott Kelley, stepfather accused of kidnapping, is arrested at the Atlanta airport.

The English side crashed out of Europe despite Paul Scholes and Peter Schmeichel's goals at Old Trafford. 'The Volgograd Region's administration have signed an official document concerning the bankruptcy of Rotor,' the club's website stated (www.rotor-fc.com). In April a 'new' amateur club, which will also be known as Rotor Volgograd, will take part in the Russian third division. 'Over time, the Volgograd Region's administration plan to turn Rotor Volgograd into a legally binding structure, which will allow them to compete at a professional level,' the club added. Rotor, founded in 1929, finished runners-up in the Russian Premier League in 1993 and 1997. In September 1995 they knocked a United side containing the likes of David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Roy Keane, out of the UEFA Cup at the first round stage. After a 0-0 draw in Russia, Rotor drew 2-2 at Old Trafford to go through on away goals.

{"document":"A seven-year-old British boy has fallen 160ft to his death from a cliff in the Alps after becoming separated from his family on a skiing holiday. Carwyn Scott-Howell got lost on the slopes and left the piste before walking through a treacherously steep wooded area, according to a source. The Welsh schoolboy, who was formally named by police today, was holidaying in the French resort of Flaine with his mother Ceri, elder brother Gerwyn, 19, and nine-year-old sister Antonia when the accident took place. A seven-year-old British boy has died after getting separated from his parents on a family skiing holiday in the French resort of Flaine near Geneva (pictured above). He fell down a 160ft cliff after trying to find his parents. Police are still trying to piece together the tragic sequence of events, but they believe the little boy was killed instantly in the fall on Friday after leaving the marked ski slope to look for his family. Investigators are unsure how he came to be at the top of the steep 320ft-high cliff, which overshadows the Lac de Flaine. One theory is that he wandered away from a blue run to try to find his family, while there has also been speculation that he may have fallen off one of the ski resort's lifts. His frantic family began searching for him at around 4pm. They scoured the piste and, increasingly worried, alerted the piste patrol who launched a search. At around 6pm search and rescue workers discovered his tracks in the snow leading through woodland up to the top of the cliff, where they found his abandoned skis. He was then spotted by rescuers in a helicopter, and they recovered his body at around 7.30pm from the bottom of the cliff. The area was described as a 'dangerous, out-of-bounds area' by emergency services, who said rescuers had to be winched down from a helicopter to retrieve the body. The conditions in the French ski resort of Flaine (pictured) were clear and sunny but it is believed the boy ventured off-piste while trying to find his parents. Police found tracks in the snow which led to his body. Michel Ollagnon, an officer with the Bonneville mountain rescue service, told reporters that the boy had been skiing with his mother, brother and sister, but he had asked to ski alone for his last descent of the day. He said the boy had then fallen off a rocky outcrop after apparently losing his way. Police chief Patrick Poirot, the head of the mountain rescue division in Annecy, added: 'His family were on the piste and then they could not see him. 'They looked for him but couldn't see him anywhere on the piste. They went to the piste patrol and said: 'Our child has disappeared' and a search was started. 'At about 6pm some tracks were discovered in the snow. It was in a very dangerous, out-of-bounds area. The tracks led to the little boy's skis. 'They were there in the snow at the top of a cliff. It was very dangerous. The piste patrol could not go down the cliff. So they called a helicopter but it could not land. They spotted the boy and rescuers were then winched down but the child was dead. It was now about 7.30pm.' He added: 'Hypothetically we think that the little boy didn't know where to go and skied in the wrong direction. He's just seven years old. 'He left the marked ski slope and probably skied to the top of a cliff. He then stopped, removed his skis, walked a little way and then fell. 'He fell 50 metres. Specialists are now at the scene to try and determine exactly what happened and understand every element that led to this tragedy.' Resort boss Sylvain Philippe, director of the Societe du Domaine Skiable de Flaine, said: 'The whole resort has been affected by the death of this young boy. We are thinking above all of his family. 'An enquiry into his death has started to find out the exact circumstances of what happened. Unfortunately and sadly they confirmed that his body was found off piste in an area of the resort called Aujon. 'He was very far from the piste, it's not a skiable area. He was unfortunately found in the middle of the cliffs, everyone has been very affected by it. 'We're working with the police and the family on this and we will be helping the family for as long as they need.' Carwyn's mother Ceri lives with her husband Rhys in the Brecon Beacons where the pair run the award-winning Coity Bach Farm near Talybont-on-Usk.

David Cameron was once pictured buying scotch eggs from the couple's stand at an agricultural show in Wales in July 2014. On the Coity Bach website it tells how ex-nurse Ceri and former butcher Rhys bought the farm to live out their dream of growing their own food and living 'the good life'. Last night, relatives at the farm were too upset to speak, but a neighbour told of the village's shock. 'It's extremely sad \u2013 they are a loving family and he was a smashing lad,' said one neighbour, who did not want to be named.

We will all rally round her when they return from France.' An assistant from Ski Set, a shop in the resort where the family had hired some of their equipment, said: 'They loved skiing. They said that they had been to lots of ski resorts before. 'They were a very nice family. The little boy seemed just happy to be on holiday. They had been on holiday for a week.

{"document":"Recently, Robert Kennedy Jr. was in Sacramento, California, to campaign against Senate Bill 227, which makes it harder for parents to opt out of vaccinations. In his remarks at an anti-vaccination movie screening, he decided to compare \"vaccine-induced\" autism to the Holocaust. He said, \"They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,\" Kennedy said. \"This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.\" A few days later, he apologized to people who were outraged on behalf of the memory of the Holocaust. To many, it's sacrilege to compare any lesser issue to the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis. In a statement, Kennedy said, \"I want to apologize to all whom I offended by my use of the word to describe the autism epidemic. I employed the term during an impromptu speech as I struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism, which has now destroyed the lives of over 20 million children and shattered their families.\" Robert Kennedy Jr. has apologized for the wrong things. First and foremost, vaccines do not cause autism. The two have nothing to do with each other. Second, he seems to think people with autism are \"gone,\" their lives \"destroyed\" and their families \"shattered.\" Autism is not a death sentence. People with autism are not missing or destroyed. They are everywhere, trying to live their lives in a society that too often demeans them as subhuman, missing or worthless. Kennedy's rhetoric is a problem, even beyond the fraudulent basis for his claims about vaccines. People who believe autism is an environmental disease try to cure kids with quack treatments like giving them bleach-based enemas. Others, believing autism functions as a death sentence, even kill their children. I am worried about the effect of having such a powerful, high-profile member of our political class endorse this demeaning depiction of life with autism. I reached out to a number of autistic activists for comment. Ari Ne'eman, president of the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, wrote, \"Robert Kennedy Jr, who has engaged with autism only to spread lies, misinformation and dehumanizing rhetoric, has never meaningfully engaged in efforts to improve the lives of autistic Americans. While his father, uncle and many others in the Kennedy-Shriver family championed the rights of people with disabilities, he has instead cast his lot with those who use pseudo-science to question our humanity.\" These are harsh words, but try to see the situation through Ne'eman's eyes. Not only is Kennedy perpetuating a discredited theory, but he's also suggesting that it's better to let your children get preventable and sometimes fatal diseases than risk becoming autistic. The usual response to people like Ne'eman is that he is \"high functioning,\" but what of the burden to families who are struggling to care for less able individuals? Henry Frost, an autistic teenager and writer, is devastated by this focus on burden. Last year, he wrote a post to other autistic children: \"Know you are not a burden or trouble for being. You are a person who has every right to be. A family that is saying love but saying you are so hard so wrong for not being as they wanted. The family is wrong. Not You.\" Meanwhile, Amy Sequenzia, an autistic activist and blogger, wrote, \"I am very disabled, have most of the usual not autism but co-occurring conditions, seizures almost every day, but am happy, proud and accomplished, with the human supports I have. That's what is missing. Acceptance.\" As children, Sequenzia and Frost might well have been just the kinds of people labeled as \"gone,\" by Kennedy. Clearly, both are very much present. The solution lies in understanding autism and related conditions as part of human diversity. Michael S. Monje Jr., an autistic writer and editor with Autonomous Press, wrote, \"The neurodiversity movement is a direct counter to this kind of attitude. It is a way for autistic people, as well as anyone else who experiences the world differently due to their neurology, to assert that these natural divergences in human development are just that -- natural. The fact that they are largely unsupported by our society as it is currently configured does not make them in any way less natural, less worthy, or less beautiful than other ways of being in the world.\" I wish Kennedy realized how much his apology demeaned people with intellectual disabilities, even as he defended the sacred status of the Holocaust. There is, though, one story from the Holocaust that he might do well to consider. The first group the Nazis systematically exterminated, in the infamous Action T4, were people with intellectual and other kinds of disabilities.  Thousands of children, adolescents and adults were sent to gas chambers, laying the groundwork for the later, larger scale acts of genocide. Underlying Action T4 was the belief that people with disabilities were devoid of value. We fight those beliefs by celebrating neurodiversity, not by fearmongering. Kennedy owes a lot of people another apology.\n","right_summary":"David Perry: Robert Kennedy Jr. compared autism to the Holocaust, wrongly tied it to vaccines.

They welcomed daughter Willow-Star (right with Mr Lee) after surrogate Viktoria Ellis gave birth on February 25. Phoenix Blue (left) was\u00a0born naturally after a 16-hour induced labour, weighing 7lb 15oz, while\u00a0Willow-Star was born a healthy 7lb at\u00a0surrogate Viktoria Ellis\u2019s home after a 25-minute labour that was so quick the dads\u2019 were woken by a text saying: \u2018Your girl is here!\u2019 Showing off baby number two for the first time, the civil partners told how their rapidly expanding brood has left them exhausted but elated. The latest addition is daughter Willow-Star Shirley Harris-Lee. She was born a healthy 7lb at surrogate mother Viktoria Ellis\u2019s home on February 25 \u2013 after a 25-minute labour that was so quick the gay dads\u2019 were woken by a text message saying: \u2018Your little girl is here!\u2019 First child Phoenix Blue Harris-Lee \u2013 a boy \u2013 was born naturally on January 14 after a 16-hour induced labour, weighing 7lb 15oz. His surrogate mother was Bex Harris, Viktoria\u2019s best friend. Baby number three \u2013 known to be a boy \u2013 is being carried by Bex\u2019s sister-in-law Becky Harris and is due in July. The birth will mean Mr Harris \u2013 who is not related to the two mothers \u2013 and Mr Lee will have completed their family of three within seven months. Mr Harris, 51, a computer programmer from Surrey, said: \u2018Going from having an empty home to having two precious babies in a such a short period has been a whirlwind, but even after weeks of feeding on demand we feel overjoyed. \u2018We are relishing every moment of becoming dads. We spent 15 years fearing we\u2019d never be able to have children, so while at times, as every parent knows, you are completely knackered, the sense of elation far outweighs any negatives.\u2019 He described becoming fathers as \u2018life-affirming and life-changing\u2019 for himself and Mr Lee, 41, a dentist. \u2018We now truly understand what unconditional love means \u2013 the only downside is that we don\u2019t go to the pub any more!\u2019 said Mr Harris. \u2018We now don\u2019t look at ourselves as a couple, we are a family unit, and fiercely protective of our little clan.\u2019 Mr Harris, 51, a computer programmer (pictured left holding Willow-Star), described\u00a0becoming fathers as \u2018life-affirming and life-changing\u2019 for himself and Mr Lee, 41, a dentist (right with Phoenix Blue).

The couple\u2019s third child, yet to be born, was created using Mr Lee\u2019s sperm. Willow-Star was delivered by Viktoria\u2019s neighbour in Suffolk, who happens to be Bex\u2019s mother, Karen Harris, who also runs the internet surrogacy forum where the women and fathers met. Mr Harris and Mr Lee drove there as soon as they could. \u2018When we arrived at Viktoria\u2019s house our beautiful daughter was snuggled up in blankets, looking so tiny and vulnerable and she was absolutely perfect in every way,\u2019 Mr Harris said. After a hospital check-up, the couple took Willow home to meet Phoenix, who was born using Bex\u2019s eggs and Mr Lee\u2019s sperm. As Willow was created using Viktoria\u2019s eggs and Mr Harris\u2019s sperm, they are not biologically connected. The couple looked into adoption before deciding to have children using surrogates, after reading about Sir Elton John and David Furnish becoming fathers through surrogacy.

{"document":"Jockey Aidan Coleman is hoping he has received the call up for the ride that will finally help him banish his Crabbie's Grand National blues at Aintree on Saturday. The 26-year-old rides well-backed The Druids Nephew, stepping in for broken leg victim Barry Geraghty on the Neil Mulholland-trained gelding which won on the opening day of last month's Cheltenham Festival. The eight-year-old is a 12-1 shot for the \u00a31million steeplechase but Coleman knows more than most how fickle fortune can be in the biggest steeplechase in the world. Jockey Aidan Coleman (left) exits the weighing room at Haydock racecourse back in April earlier this year. The Druids Nephew ridden by Barry Geraghty clears the last jump during Day One of Cheltenham 2015. As a 20-year-old, Coleman chose to ride seventh fence faller Stan, a disappointment turned into a calamity at the time because he had decided against partnering successful Venetia Williams-trained stablemate Mon Mome who lifted the prize at 100-1 with stand-in rider Liam Treadwell basking in glory. It was the only time in three National runs for Mon Mome that Coleman had not ridden the gelding. Coleman's two latest rides in the race have seen him unseated from a hampered The Rainbow Hunter. Coleman said: 'The Mom Mome incident was quite a blow at the time because I had a choice (of mounts) and picked the wrong one. I rode him the year before and the year afterwards, I just wasn't on him on the right day but that is just the way it goes. 'Sometimes you are ahead and sometimes you are behind \u2013 that is life in general. 'At the time I was 20, very young in life as well as racing. It was probably the first negative thing to happen in my career. 'Up until then I had never been injured, I had ridden out my claim in 14 months and was champion conditional. Since then there have been lots of good days and lots of bad days, so you become more streetwise and thicker skinned. 'I didn't had the best of luck on The Rainbow Hunter. He jumped well both times but ran into traffic problems and was more of less brought down last year. 'There is an element of luck required in any race but that applies more with the National because of the nature of the fences and the distance.' Coleman, who has enjoyed success over the famous fences in other races, feels The Druids Nephew has the right credential given that slice of Aintree luck which has so far eluded him. The jockey who hopes to be a contender for champion jockey after AP McCoy retires, added: 'It is definitely one of the best rides to pick up. Phil Smith, the chief handicapper, says he is the best handicapped horse in the race. 'The race should suit this horse. He seems quite hardy.

{"document":"It is a fascinating view of exactly what goes into a modern smartphone - and how Samsung does business. The Chipworks site has posted this amazing image revealing the internals of the firm's Galaxy S6, which goes on sale on April 10th. The internals reveal Samsung used more of its own chips to power the new Galaxy S6 smartphone than it did for the predecessor S5, according to an early teardown report, in a blow to U.S. chip supplier Qualcomm. The teardown shows, from the front, the screen, logic board holder, battery, logic board with processor, camera, rear case and antenna. Samsung is not only using its own Exynos mobile processor, as had been widely reported, but also decided to rely on its in-house semiconductor business to source other parts, including the modem and power management integrated circuit chips, Ottawa-based consultancy Chipworks said. Samsung is counting on its new flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 edge phones to help revive earnings momentum after a disappointing 2014. Strong sales of system chips such as its Exynos processor could also help boost earnings, analysts and investors say. The Galaxy S6 also comes with Samsung's Shannon modem chip, U.S. phone carrierAT&T said on its website. 'It's pretty clear if they're using Shannon for the modem for AT&T that they're trying to use all-Samsung silicon,' said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research. 'With their market share going down they're under pressure to increase profit margins.' The findings suggest a deeper loss of business for Qualcomm in the new generation of Samsung's flagship handsets than anticipated previously. Teardown reports of the predecessor Galaxy S5, released last year, showed the U.S. chipmaker supplied several components that Samsung has supplanted with its own this year, based on the phone Chipworks investigated. Samsung's new S6 and S6 Edge: The phones are also the first to feature dual-standard wireless charging technology built inside the handsets, and will battle the iPhone and HTC's One. Qualcomm said in January that a key customer declined to use its new Snapdragon processor in an upcoming flagship phone presumed to be Samsung's Galaxy S6. But it had been unclear whether Samsung would drop Qualcomm's modem chips as well. Qualcomm is the industry leader in LTE, the most advanced modem technology, but Samsung, Intel, MediaTek and others have developing their own offerings.

{"document":"The first high-resolution footage of solar flux ropes on the sun has been revealed. In the fascinating video, twisting groups of magnetic fields can be seen writhing around. And with the new images it may be possible to further understand their evolution and how they cause space weather. Research led by a scientist at the New Jersey Institute of Technology has revealed the first high-resolution footage of a solar flux 'rope' taking shape on the sun, shown in this still image. The new footage was revealed in a paper in Nature Communications led by Dr Haimin Wang from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. A solar flare accompanies the twisting flux rope in the footage, which moves around a common axis before bursting from the sun. They are essentially twisted bundles of magnetic field that extend out of and back into the surface across hundreds of kilometres. As common structures in the solar corona, they are thought to be the main cause of several types of solar weather - including solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The formation of a flux rope can take weeks, but the  moment when it is flung into the atmosphere can take just a matter of hours. Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. Astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth's magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. In the video, twisting groups of magnetic fields writhe around a central axis, and the rope ultimately causes a bright flash - a solar flare - to form, shown here. Dr Wang and his colleagues made the findings using the 5.2ft (1.6 metres) New Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory in California. They describe an S-shaped bundle of magnetic fields, from which a set of loops peel off and grow upward into a multi-stranded flux rope in just two minutes. Two flare ribbons also appear at the point where the rope joins the solar atmosphere. It is hoped the study, which shows a flux rope in unprecedented detail, could help increase understanding on how they form - and how they are related to solar eruptions. \u2018In the large scale, magnetic flux ropes are found in the interplanetary magnetic clouds, which may interact with Earth\u2019s magnetic field to generate geomagnetic storms,\u2019 the researchers wrote in their paper. Solar flux ropes are common structures in the solar corona, and they are thought to be the main cause of several types of solar weather \u2013 including solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), pictured.\n","right_summary":"New Jersey Institute of Technology research reveals stunning video.

Grant Allen (left), 38, of Harlow, Essex, travelled round the world with his girlfriend, Gaynor Godwin (right) using money from a mortgage fraud scam. Edward Byatt (behind Allen, left) was also involved in the fraud. Allen also splurged \u00a38,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to Disney World. The Old Bailey heard that he hid the fraud by buying and trading properties and funnelling large amounts of cash through his unwitting girlfriend's bank account. The couple lived in a \u00a3700,000 home in Rayne, Essex - where \u00a333,000 was spent on landscaping the garden - and also owned a property in Hertfordshire, bought with the proceeds of the fraud. When the home in Essex was raided in 2011, detectives found large piles of cash including \u00a31,000 which was stashed in the extractor fan in the kitchen. Judge Stephen Kramer QC today ordered Allen to pay back \u00a3491,000 as the proceeds of crime. Allen, who was jailed for six years for mortgage fraud and money laundering, could face another three years behind bars if he fails to pay the money back. Allen splurged \u00a38,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to Disney World. However, the court heard he has assets including homes in Essex, Bishop Stortford, and southern Spain which he can sell to cover the repayment. A second defendant, Edward Byatt, 39, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex, was ordered to pay back \u00a310,000 for his part in the fraud. His name was on the deeds for the home in Rayne, despite Allen living there with Ms Godwin and their young son. \u2018Grant Allen used other people in the laundering process. He is somehow involved in criminal behaviour,\u2019 prosecutor Charles Evans told the trial in 2013. \u2018The money would have been criminal proceeds.\u2019 During his trial, Allen claimed he worked as a meat trader and a builder, and suggested his funds had come from successful gambling ventures. The pair stayed at top hotels on at least eight holidays costing \u00a330,000 between 2006 and 2010, including a trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2009 worth \u00a37,600. Mr Evans told the jury: \u2018Grant Allen and Gaynor Godwin lived an enviable lifestyle and travelled to Dubai and America, sometimes travelling first class and staying in luxury hotels.\u2019 Godwin was cleared by the jury of conspiracy to remove criminal property after telling them she had no idea where Allen had got the large sums of money. But Allen and Byatt were both convicted after trial and were both in court to hear the order being made.

Detectives raided Dr Rory Lyons\u2019 private health centre and medical officials have suspended the 62-year-old from treating patients. Cousins Karen and Colin Cosheril were patients of the Alderney family doctor when they died. Islanders claim the death from pneumonia of Karen, 52, in January prompted the investigation, which then uncovered three more deaths of concern \u2013 including that of retired stonemason Colin, 63, who died of heart failure in May. Mr Cosheril\u2019s sister \u2013 ambulance technician Brenda Webb \u2013 said she complained to Guernsey\u2019s health service after his sudden death. The mother-of-two, 61, said: \u2018His death was very sudden. It was a shock. My brother was getting well one day and the next day he went downhill too quickly \u2013 the day after that he was dead.\u2019 A family friend of divorcee Karen Cosheril, who used to work at the island\u2019s Chinese takeaway, said: \u2018Just before she died there didn\u2019t seem to be anything wrong with her. Then she phoned me and said she was in hospital. 'The next day I got a call saying she had died from pneumonia and I thought, \u201cThat is sudden isn\u2019t it?\u201d It was strange because that usually takes time.\u2019 A family member said of Miss Cosheril, who was also known by her married name of Tayleur, said: \u2018Her death is one of those being investigated. We were in complete shock when we heard.\u2019 More than 10 Guernsey police officers flew to the island to search Dr Lyons\u2019 Eagle Medical Practice last Thursday. The surgery remained shut over the Easter weekend. A note referring patients to the other island practice was pinned to the door and signed by Dr Lyons, who also worked at the island\u2019s care home. The father-of-two lives in Alderney with his wife. The blinds of their home were shut over the weekend but he was spotted at a flat close to the surgery in the town of St Anne\u2019s. He has not responded to requests for comment. Medical records and other documents were seen being taken from his surgery during the five-hour police search. A search warrant was also executed at a private address. A spokesman for Guernsey\u2019s Health and Social Services Department said the investigation was launched when concerns were raised about a death earlier in the year. The police were then informed after an internal investigation identified the three other potentially suspicious deaths. All four patients died in the past 18 months.

A recent surge in jellyfish numbers has moved tourism group Stay In Cornwall to reassure swimmers that the water is fine and we need not be discouraged by the sight of these brainless, boneless creatures that have been around for 500 million years. 'We want to put the minds of holidaymakers at ease by showing that jellyfish are not as harmful as they may appear,' says Stay In Cornwall's Matt Fletcher. 'Swimming in the sea is one of the most enjoyable parts of a coastal holiday and one that should not be avoided simply because of jellyfish in the water.' With the warmer months comes a surge in the number of jellyfish, such as this barrel variety at Kynance Cove, off the UK's coastline. The water is fine: Stay In Cornwall has reassured swimmers to not be discouraged by the increased sight of the unusual sea creatures. Not all jellyfish found off UK beaches can sting humans, and for the majority of cases, stings are mild or are easily treated. How to deal with a sting as changed in recent years, with the long-adopted method of pouring vinegar over stings now considered a big no-no. The theory that covering the affected area with urine has also been debunked, with NHS now recommending the best product to use now is  shaving cream. Stay in Cornwall's put together a simple guide to dealing with UK jellyfish with help from University of Exeter natural environment lecturer Dr Matthew Witt, a jellyfish fan who urges beachgoers to look but don't touch. The stunning sight of a compass jellyfish (Chrysaora hysoscella), which has a painful sting, captured underwater in Cornwall. Thousands of visitors who will soon flock to the UK's beaches have been told to look but not touch jellyfish they will inevitably see. 'Jellyfish are an important part of our British wildlife and lead amazing lives - we see them year round, but mostly in summer months and lots around the South West, this is a great place to see marine wildlife,' Dr Witt says. 'But remember look and don't touch. If you do happen to come into contact with a jellyfish then follow these simple instructions. Also, please take time to inform the Marine Conservation Society of your sighting as this information will help us to understand the health of our coastal seas.' If the person stung doesn't have serious symptoms such as breathing difficulties or chest pain and hasn't been caught in a sensitive area, such as the face or genitals you can deal with a sting yourself, says the NHS. After leaving the water immediately the stung person should stay as still as possible to not to increase the spread of toxins through the body. The stingers should then be removed (tweezers are best) and then apply the shaving cream. An ice pack will also reduce pain and inflammation if one is available.\u00a0Vinegar and other alcohol-based substances are now discouraged as they activate unfired stinging cells, while urine also makes things worse. After the shaving cream is applied, we're advised to use a 'razor blade, credit card or shell to remove any nematocysts (small poisonous sacs) that are stuck to the skin.' Paracetamol and ibuprofen can also be taken to help relieve pain and inflammation.\n","right_summary":"A recent surge in jellyfish numbers has been recorded off the coast of the UK as the weather has warmed up.

The Arsenal manager will have a heart-to-heart chat with the forward ahead of Saturday\u2019s crunch top-four clash against Liverpool. Walcott was hauled off after 55 minutes of England\u2019s 1-1 draw in Italy on Tuesday night. Theo Walcott struggled for England and Arsene Wenger admits he is concerned by the winger's confidence. Walcott was replaced by Ross Barkley after just 55 minutes of England's 1-1 draw against Italy on Tuesday. 2 -\u00a0Premier League goals for Walcott this season - his average haul per season during his time at Arsenal is 5.6. It was the latest disappointment in a difficult season for the 26-year-old, who has struggled for game time since returning from a long-term lay-off due to a serious knee injury. With Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain out of Liverpool\u2019s visit due to a hamstring strain, and Danny Welbeck a major doubt after sustaining a knee problem on international duty, Walcott could start on Saturday. But Wenger said: \u2018Yes, I\u2019m worried about Theo\u2019s confidence. He\u2019s sensitive and I\u2019m a bit concerned about the damage that game can have on his mind. Walcott could face Liverpool on Saturday with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain injured and Danny Welbeck a doubt. \u2018He\u2019s not completely there yet (after the injury). But being exposed like that, people have a harsh judgement on him that is not deserved because he does well. \u2018At the moment he is frustrated, but that is normal. I will speak with him, but I think he is strong enough. \u2018I will see what state of mind he is in. We always have a word, if it is a positive experience or a negative experience, you ask \u201chow did it go?\u201d. We always speak about the last game. \u2018He is not fragile mentally, he is strong mentally but he is disappointed because when you come back from an injury you always think you are ready. \u2018He needs patience. He is at the moment not in his best mood. \u2018He has big confidence in himself and he has gone through some difficult periods in his life and he has always come out with strength.\u2019 Arsenal boss Wenger says he will speak with Walcott but believes the Gunners winger is 'strong enough' Walcott found himself playing in the No 10 role for England in Turin \u2014 a role he is not accustomed to. And Wenger admitted he was surprised to see the pacy forward in such an unfamiliar position. \u2018Have I ever seen him play No 10 in training or anything? No,\u2019 said Wenger. \u2018Theo\u2019s strength is the quality of his movements, he wants to go to get on the end of things. He\u2019s not a guy who provides. \u2018I don\u2019t think it was the intention of Roy Hodgson to play him there. It\u2019s maybe because Wayne Rooney took the initiative during the game to play higher up and tell Theo to drop back. \u2018I didn\u2019t see Roy Hodgson in the game stand up to say \u201cWalcott, you come and play in midfield and Rooney you go up front\u201d. That\u2019s an initiative they took on the pitch.\u2019 Walcott aims a shot at goal during England's friendly against Italy at the Juventus Stadium in Turin. Walcott was starting his first international game in 18 months having injured his cruciate ligaments. Meanwhile, Wenger insists there are fundamental flaws in FA chairman Greg Dyke\u2019s proposal to increase the number of required homegrown players in Premier League squads to 12. Dyke believes increasing the number of British players in squads will help contribute to a more successful England team. But Wenger said: \u2018I believe we are in a top level competition and you earn your right through the quality of your performance rather than your place of birth. \u2018Secondly, I\u2019m happy to, and would like to contribute to the quality of the English national team, but you have two questions you can raise before that. \u2018First of all between 1966 and 1996 there were no foreign players in England and it didn\u2019t improve too much the performances of the national team. \u2018Secondly, if between the ages of 16 and 21 the England youth teams win every single competition in Europe then there is something we have to do because they are not getting their chance at the top level. Wenger believes there are flaws in FA Chairman Greg Dyke\u2019s proposal to increase the homegrown quota. \u2018That is not the case, on the contrary. I think between 16 and 21 the English youth teams, until now, have not performed. So that\u2019s the heart of the problem. \u2018Let\u2019s get better at that level, then if there is a problem integrating these players in the top teams, we have to do something about it. \u2018I think today you have to be very brave to integrate young players in the top teams because the pressure is very high. I still believe when they are good enough, they play. \u2018You speak about Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane. Nobody stops the quality, no matter where they are from.

{"document":"Troubled footballer Clarke Carlisle has revealed he has split from his wife as he continues to battle with depression following his failed suicide attempt. The former Premier League defender said he had 'moved out of the marital home' in Yorkshire that he shared with his wife of 14 years, Gemma. Mr Carlisle tried to kill himself in December, two days after he was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving. Scroll down for video. Split:\u00a0Clarke Carlisle says he has 'moved out of the marital home' in Yorkshire that he shared with his wife of 14 years, Gemma. The pair are pictured together in 2013. The 35-year-old father-of-three stepped in front of a 12-ton truck on the A64 near York in December, suffering cuts, bruises, internal bleeding, a broken rib and a shattered left knee. The incident has left the ex-Burnley defender with scars all over his body. On television this week Mr Carlisle, who has publicly struggled with depression, revealed the scars he still bears from his suicide attempt are a 'constant reminder' of his good fortune in surviving. Now Mr Carlisle, who played 131 times for the Clarets between 2007 and 2012, said the accident had led to him moving out of the house he shared with wife Gemma. The sportsman, dubbed 'Britain's brainiest footballer' after he appeared on Countdown in 2002,\u00a0told TalkSport Radio on a special Monday night show: 'At this point, Gemma and I have separated. 'I have moved out of the marital home because I have to focus on my well-being and equally as much Gemma has to do the same. 'She has to deal with her experiences and the effect that has had on her.' Mr Carlisle appeared on Good Morning Britain this week and revealed the scars he still bears from his suicide attempt are a 'constant reminder' of his good fortune in surviving. Asked about how his wife Gemma has taken it, he added: 'Every day has been incredibly tough and different. 'When you have been with someone for 14 years but masking things and thoughts from her, it was because I was a people-pleaser. 'I've desperately wanted to say what I know will make her happy and do the things that I think she wants me to do - instead of being myself.' Earlier this week Mr Carlisle apologised to the driver of the lorry which he jumped in front of in an attempt to kill himself. The former footballer said that he prays for the driver, Darren Pease, every day - but added that he has been unable to apologise in person because the haulier refuses to meet him. Star: Mr Carlisle pictured playing for Burnley against Aston Villa in 2010, at the peak of his footballing career. Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain on Tuesday, Mr Carlisle said he was 'so sorry' for putting Mr Pease through the ordeal of being involved in a near-fatal crash. Speaking earlier this month, Mr Pease, 53, said that he might never be able to drive a lorry again after hitting Mr Carlisle.

{"document":"A furious landowner was forced to fork out thousands of pounds to restore a public path to one of Britain's most popular beauty spots. James Weld stumped up \u00a315,000 to bring an end to a three year stand-off with Natural England over who was responsible for the coastal path down to the beach at Durdle Door on Dorset's Jurassic Coast. The previous steps that lead down to the popular tourist attraction were washed away in storms in 2012. James Weld has stumped up \u00a315,000 to end a three-year stand-off with Natural England over access to Durdle Door beach. Since then visitors have faced a perilous scramble down a crumbling cliff to reach the shore, even resorting to sliding down on their backsides. The iconic rock archway and neighbouring Lulworth Cove are part of the Weld family's 12,000-acre Lulworth estate. The family have maintained the steps since they first bought the land in the 1600s. But in 2009, Natural England was handed responsibility for the country's coastal paths under the Coastal Access Act.\u00a0The government also announced a 630-mile path along the south west coast which was to be opened in time for the Olympics. However, Mr Weld says that Natural England 'shirked' its duty to reinstate the steps under the law for three years by claiming they did not form part of the coastal path. Calling the long-running dispute 'laughable and ludicrous', he also accused the organisation of ignoring advice given to them on how to manage tourist hotspots like the Lulworth Estate. The steps to access the iconic rock archway on the Dorset Jurassic coast had been washed away during storms in 2012. Natural England said they were happy the steps had been reopened but declined to comment on Mr Weld's claims. The estate took the decision to rebuild the 88 steps themselves after becoming 'utterly fed-up with the bureaucracy', Mr Weld said. Mr Weld, a chartered surveyor, said: 'For quite a number of decades now people have visited our coasts and beaches quite freely. 'About 20 or so years ago we decided to put in steps leading down to the beaches so they didn't have to scramble down the cliffs to get to them. In 2009 the Coastal Access Act came along and we had lots of meetings with Natural England about managing 'honeypot' sites like Lulworth. 'We had assurances from them that they wouldn't interfere with the Lulworth Estate because they were happy with the way we were running things. 'Then they announced their big idea, which was to open a 630-mile path along the south west coast in time for the Olympics - a path that had already existed for about 40 years - and duly spent a vast amount of money on it. The washed-away steps meant visitors were left to scramble up and down the dangerous crumbling cliffs to try and access the beach. The Government body had been granted responsibility for the country's coastal paths under the Coastal Access Act 2009. 'You can understand the idiocy of this plan. Our view was that if the coast path was now a public right of way under the Coastal Access Act and controlled by Natural England then Natural England should pay for it. 'One would have thought that would have been the logical answer but Natural England disagreed. 'Their response was that they were giving the public access to beaches but not the means to actually do it. 'In 2012 the steps down to Durdle Door were washed away in the heavy spring weather we had. It was clear the steps needed replacing but Natural England said they weren't responsible for them. 'We got to a stand-off with Natural England - we wanted them to accept their responsibility while they were saying 'it's nothing to do with us'. 'About six months ago we got utterly fed up with all the bureaucracy and took the decision to get on with it and pay for the steps ourselves. 'The cost was about \u00a315,000 - not a huge amount of money for a huge Government body like Natural England but a lot for us. Mr Weld says Natural England 'shirked' its duty for three years by claiming they did not form part of the coastal path, leaving him to pay the \u00a315,000 to rebuild the steps which have now been reopened (pictured) 'We have a very good relationship with Natural England in all other areas but with coastal access they have ignored all the advice right from the beginning about managing honeypot sites. 'The whole thing has been laughable and ludicrous and I've lost patience with it. 'In the end, regardless of who was officially responsible or the cost, we felt the need to step in to put Durdle Door back on the map for walkers and sightseers, and to help minimise the environmental impact to this extraordinary coastal feature. 'Durdle Door is a national icon as well as one of Dorset's icons so we're delighted to be able to reopen it, but it's sad it's taken so long.' The \u00a315,000 will add to the \u00a340,000 the Lulworth Estate currently spends each year maintaining paths on its land. A spokesman for Natural England said: 'It's good news that the Durdle Door beach steps have been reopened and that local visitors can have safe access to the beach to enjoy this wonderful stretch of the English coast. 'We're not going to be responding to those remarks made by Mr Weld.' Humphrey Weld, a direct ancestor of James Weld, bought Lulworth Castle and its sprawling estate in 1641 from politician Thomas Howard, 3rd Viscount Howard of Bindon. The Weld estate owns around five miles of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which includes Durdle Door and Lulworth Cove. Natural England said it was glad Durdle Door's beach steps have been reopened but would not comment on the landowner's claims. It has remained in the Weld family ever since. It was gutted by fire in 1929 and only fully restored in the 1990s by the Weld estate and English Heritage. The estate owns around five miles of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which includes Durdle Door and Lulworth Cove. The two beauty spots attract more than 500,000 visitors a year. Agriculture plays a large part in the estate, and it still produces 25 million litres of milk a year, much of which is sold to Marks and Spencer. In 2013 Natural England said claims made by Lulworth Estate owner James Weld that the 2009 Coastal Access Act handed them responsibility for the steps to Durdle Door were untrue. A Natural England spokesman said in 2013: 'Contrary to Mr Weld's statement, the legislation does not take land away from landowners or interfere with their freedom to manage it. 'Durdle Door beach still belongs to the Lulworth Estate and is managed alongside the estate's nearby holiday park, generating revenue from visitors to the park and more widely. 'The estate has always maintained the steps down on to the beach and remains able to do so now.'\n","right_summary":"James Weld had to stump up \u00a315,000 to restore steps to the beach  at Durdle Door which were washed away in 2012.

{"document":"Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq are being led by a highly secretive group of strategists and officials that were once senior figures in Saddam Hussein's army. Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the late Iraqi dictator's military. Almost all of the regional commanders appointed by ISIS' leader and self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, played prominent roles in the Baathist army before the 2003 invasion of Iraq and became involved with ISIS either in the resulting insurgency or after the dictator's 2006 execution. Influence: Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the military of Saddam Hussein (pictured) Militants: Almost all the highly secretive officials overseeing the day-to-day running of the Islamic State (pictured) are former members of Saddam Hussein's Baathist army. One of the most prominent former Iraqi Army generals within ISIS was Abu Muslim al-Turkmani\u00a0(left) who led the terrorists' operations in Iraq until he was killed in an American airstrike last November.\u00a0Abu Ayman al-Iraqi (right), a former colonel in Iraqi Air Force intelligence now plays a leading role in ISIS' military council. One former Syrian rebel who became an ISIS regional commander told the Washington Post that he found that almost all of the highly secretive officials overseeing all aspects to the terror group's day-to-day business were ex members of Hussein's Baathist army. During one meeting in which he dared to disagree with fellow commanders at an ISIS meeting, the man calling himself Abu Hamza was placed under arrest on the orders of a masked man who had sat silently and almost unnoticed at the side of the room, listening and taking notes. Although the enigmatic commander's real name was never revealed to him, Hamza said that he later discovered that the man had been an intelligence officer for the Iraqi army before joining ISIS. The same went for the other ISIS commanders Hamza met, who either used code names or no names at all in the hope of concealing their past as members of Hussein's army. As well as their extensive military expertise, another key element of the commanders' appointments has been the fact the ex-Baathists have extensive contacts among oil smugglers thanks to Hussein's efforts to avoid international sanctions in the 1990s. Crucially, oil smuggling is considered the most lucrative aspect of ISIS' \u00a32 billion-a-year income. Leader: Almost all of the regional commanders appointed by ISIS' leader and self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured), played prominent roles in the Baathist army before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Experience: Former Iraqi Army colonel Haji Bakr (left) was al-Baghdadi's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution at the hands of Syrian rebels in January 2014. Pictured right is\u00a0Abu Ahmad al-Alwani - a former Baathist soldier and now an ISIS military council member. The former Iraqi Army generals' connections with oil smugglers are crucial to\u00a0ISIS' \u00a32 billion-a-year income. Middle East analysts and experts believe one key reason why so many former Iraqi army commanders have joined ISIS is due to the\u00a0de-Baathification law brought in\u00a0L.\u00ad Paul Bremer - the American who served as temporary head of the Iraqi state following the ousting of Hussein. The law effectively meant that 400,000 members of the defeated Iraqi army could no longer be employed in government roles and were barred from drawing their military pensions. Many of these highly-trained commanders joined the insurgency in the country in the mid-2000s, which was dominated by ISIS who at the time were known by the name Al Qaeda in Iraq. When al-Baghdadi took control of the group in 2010, many of these commanders were given prominent leadership roles in the hope they might win the support of the Sunni tribes who dominate Western Iraq and who have been largely ignored by the country's Shia-led Baghdad government. The process had, however been started by\u00a0al-Baghdadi's predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi who was himself a former Iraqi Army officer and therefore more trusted by the military than the Jordanian criminal, former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded ISIS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Past: The process of giving former Iraqi commanders senior roles was started by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi (left) who was a former Iraqi Army officer and therefore more trusted than the Jordanian criminal, former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded ISIS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (right) Heartbreaking:\u00a0The highest estimate for the number of recruits killed in the Speicher massacre is about 1,700. Discovery: The graves were found last Wednesday on the late Saddam Hussein's presidential compound. One of the most prominent former Iraqi Army generals within ISIS was\u00a0Fadel Ahmad Abdullah al-Hiyali, who used the code name Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, and was in charge of all the terrorists' operations in Iraq until he was killed in an American airstrike last November. He had previously been a colonel in military intelligence and served in Hussein's Republican Guard. Other senior figures include Abu Ali al-Anbari, who currently acts as Baghdadi's deputy leader in Syria and is a former military general in Hussein's Iraqi Army, and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, a former colonel in Iraqi Air Force intelligence and now plays a leading role in ISIS' military council. Less prominent militants with an Iraqi Army backgrounds include Abu Ahmad al-Alwani - a former Baathist soldier and now an ISIS military council member, Abu Kassem - a former Iraqi officer and now in charge of ISIS suicide bombers and foreign fighters. Another former Iraqi Army colonel was Haji Bakr, who is widely considered to have been al-Baghdadi's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution at the hands of a rebel group known as the Syrian Martyr's Brigade in January 2014. It is widely believed that all of the senior ISIS figures killed over the past year - including Haji Bakr - have been replaced by former members of the Iraqi Army. Horror: Images like this one of the soldiers being led through Tikrit shocked Iraq and the world. This morning Iraqi forensic teams in the newly liberated city of Tikrit have started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain some of the hundreds of soldiers killed by ISIS last year. Kamil Amin, from Iraq's Human Rights Ministry, said the work on eight locations started yesterday inside Tikrit's complex of presidential palaces, where much of the killing is thought to have occured. ISIS overran Saddam Hussein's hometown last June, capturing around 1,700 soldiers as they were trying to flee Camp Speicher, an air base previously used by U.S. troops on the outskirt of Tikrit. The fall of Tikrit was part of the ISIS onslaught that stunned Iraqi security forces and the military, which melted away as the militants advanced and captured key cities and towns in the country's north and west. Later, ISIS group posted graphic images online that showed gunmen massacring scores of the soldiers after forcing them to lay face-down in a ditch with their arms tied behind their backs. After weeks of bitter clashes, Iraqi forces and allied Shiite militias, succeeded in retaking Tikrit from ISIS. Their victory was helped by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes.\n","right_summary":"ISIS leadership is dominated by former members of Hussein's Iraqi Army.

{"document":"Residents living near the new setting for Benefits Street have been left outraged by housing bosses who they say have given it a makeover to impress new visitors. Kingston Road in Stockton is the backdrop for the latest series of the Channel 4 documentary which divided opinion with its debut in Birmingham's James Turner Street. The programme follows the lives of a handful of benefits claimants and last year split public opinion with many accusing producers of promoting 'poverty tourism'. Workmen have been seen on Kingston Road in Stockton, the setting for the newest series of Benefits Street. Angry neighbours claim housing bosses have ordered the makeover in anticipation of the show's release. Filming has finished in Stockton, with the new series set to air in the coming weeks. But local people claim housing bosses are trying to perpetuate a false image of the area, by giving it a makeover before the programme is aired. Residents have slammed the face lift saying the estate - owned by local\u00a0housing\u00a0group Thirteen Group - will look 'completely different' to anyone who visits after watching the show. 'It\u2019s normally quite a grotty street. The front gardens were\u00a0filled with all sorts of rubbish. One house had a balcony with a sofa on it. 'There were bikes just lying in\u00a0the\u00a0street left there by children,' said Mike Swift, who lives nearby.

But while Dee found fame and fortune in taking part (she no longer claims from the state, a spokesman has insisted), others were disheartened by Channel 4's portrayal of their lives.

Ilford-born Benn, who now lives in Australia and works as a charity worker, looked as sharp as ever as he joined in a playful pad session with Ricky Hatton at his Manchester gym. Benn landed a series of punches, including one that saw Hatton's glove fly off, as he put the 36-year-old through his paces following his return to England.

Hatton watches on as Benn prepares his latest assault during some pad work at the Manchester gym. Benn secured 22 straight knockouts in just over two years as a professional and impressed on the pads. Hatton is now a boxing trainer and could train Conor when he arrives in Britain in June. The younger Benn will have to go some way before he manages to surpass the accomplishments of his Dad, though, a man remembered as one of the top 10 British boxers of all time. Benn secured 22 straight knockouts in just over two years as a professional and didn't taste defeat till he came up against the underrated Michael Watson. That rare taste of defeat led to the boxer taking a gamble on life in America and he quickly won the WBO middleweight title after stopping Doug De Witt in a brutal encounter. Benn stopped Iran Barkley in just one round in a title defending performance that shocked the world in his next bout as people began to discuss just how far he could go. Barkley had been in the ring with the likes of Roberto Duran and Thomas Hearns, but there was more to come from Benn as he returned to Britain to fight Chris Eubank. The bout against Eubank was a fight that well and truly grabbed the attentions of the British public as both fighters went hell for leather as soon as the bell went. Benn knocked Eubank to the canvas during that fight, the first time Eubank had ever been sent to ground during his career. However, Eubank came back to defeat Benn in the ninth to capture the WBO belt again before Benn went on to win his next 10 fights. Boxer Chris Eubank keeps his cool as Benn confronts him ahead of one of their bouts. Benn crouches low as he looks to avoid the powerful punch of Eubank during their bout in Birmingham. He recaptured the WBC middleweight title against Mauro Galvano and defended the belt three times before he was able to face Eubank in the ring again. That re-match was one of the biggest boxing events ever staged in Britain and was watched by almost 50,000 fans at Manchester United\u2019s Old Trafford Stadium. But there was to be no separating the pair as the fight ended in a draw. However, many fans ringside believed Benn was the victor of the fight and therefore both boxers kept their respective belts.

{"document":"After years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount, the NCAA now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered. On its website, the NCAA prominently states, \"It's our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn, play and succeed.\" And later, it says that \"in the collegiate model of sports, the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first, athletes second.\" But the NCAA is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former University of North Carolina athletes. The lawsuit claimed the students didn't get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in NCAA history. In its response, the NCAA says it has no legal responsibility \"to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student-athletes at its member institutions.\" Even with pages of online information about academic standards, and even though the NCAA has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly, NCAA attorneys wrote in this court filing that \"the NCAA did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student-athletes,\" and \"the NCAA does not have 'direct, day-to-day, operational control' \" over member institutions like UNC. \"It's nonsense. It's double talk,\" said Gerald Gurney, a former athletic-academic director who is now president of The Drake Group for academic integrity in collegiate sport. \"If you look at their basic core principles, it's all about academics, the experience, the integration of academics, and the education of the student is paramount,\" Gurney said. \"They seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths.\" The NCAA referred calls for comment to an online statement, which read in part:. The NCAA believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the NCAA's role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the NCAA has taken to assist student-athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field. \"This case is troubling for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the NCAA to ensure that every student-athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them,\" said Donald Remy, NCAA chief legal officer. In its response to the lawsuit, it also likened its role to that of the American Bar Association or American Medical Association, and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately. The scandal at UNC involved thousands of athletes who, over 18 years, were funneled into classes that never met, where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports. Mary Willingham, the UNC whistleblower turned NCAA critic, has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they're academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required. The system of eligibility that the NCAA brags about, she says, is a sham. \"Why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we can't legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway? It makes no sense,\" said Willingham, who recently wrote a book about the UNC scandal called \"Cheated.\" \"If they can't legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that, then why certify students semester after semester to play? It's lost its meaning for me.\" The NCAA's claim that it's hands-off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years, not just in the rhetoric on its website, but in speeches by its president, Mark Emmert, and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes. For example, before it lost a case filed by former UCLA player Ed O'Bannon, suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses, the NCAA stood on the pillar of amateurism, insisting that college athletes are paid with an education. That's the defense the NCAA is now using in another class action filed by big-time sports attorney Jeffrey Kessler, seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value. In response, the NCAA said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education: Consistent with \"its commitment to amateurism, member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with NCAA bylaws.\" Attorney Michael Hausfeld, who represented both O'Bannon and now the UNC athletes, said this:. \"This startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the NCAA's shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes. NCAA President Mark Emmert has repeatedly proposed that 'What we live for is the education of our athletes,' but the NCAA's record tells a far different story.\" But Rick Burton, professor of sport management at Syracuse University, said it's not realistic to think that the NCAA would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country. \"I understand, I think, where the NCAA is coming from. We would not let the NCAA come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at Syracuse University,\" he said. \"It sounds like someone is trying to say the NCAA should have been supervising that department at the University of North Carolina, and there's no logic to that,\" he said. \"The people who are saying the NCAA should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the NCAA.\" UNC, which was also sued, has admitted to the fraud, but also asked for a judge to throw out the case, saying the athletes waited too long -- seven years -- to sue and the \"educational malpractice\" theory doesn't apply. UNC claims it is protected by state law. This is reminiscent of another NCAA reversal. The NCAA, which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from \"dangerous and exploitive athletic practices,\" now says it does not enforce health and safety rules. In fact, in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011, the NCAA wrote: \"The NCAA denies that it has a legal duty to protect student-athletes.\" A CNN investigation found that the NCAA has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken. It has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions -- far behind even the NFL. Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association, and a leading thorn in the NCAA's side for decades, said this latest backpedaling from the NCAA leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all. \"There's nothing left the NCAA can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society. One has to wonder what does the NCAA do if it doesn't protect players? If it doesn't play a role in the education of college athletics? It begs the question of why does the NCAA exist -- and why does it have a tax exemption.\"\n","right_summary":"In response to lawsuit, NCAA says it doesn't control quality of education for student-athletes.

{"document":"Help for Heroes has launched a fundraising drive to keep World War II veteran Robert Clark in his own home after a London council refused to pay for his ongoing care. Brent Council said it was no longer able to afford to pay for a live-in carer to stay with the 96-year-old former prisoner of war, despite the fact that Mr Clark spent his \u00a350,000 life savings on contributing to his care. Now, the council want to move Mr Clark from the house he has lived in for the past 50 years into a care home because they claim it is cheaper. Scroll down for video. Help for Heroes has given Robbie Clark, pictured, an emergency grant so he can remain at home in London. The JustGiving paged more than half of the \u00a35,000 target within a couple of hours of it going live this morning. However, Help for Heroes has launched its own JustGiving page to help Mr Clark. The charity has already given Mr Clark and emergency grant to fund his immediate care needs, but they are seeking the public's help to secure his future. They have so far raised \u00a32,736.22 of the \u00a35,000 needed. Any extra money will go towards the care of other former servicemen and women in need of assistance. Linda Walton, head of grants at Help for Heroes, said: 'Help for Heroes is all about supporting those who have been psychologically or physically wounded in service of our country. 'Robbie suffered severe anxiety and distress as a prisoner of war during the Second World War, and it is wrong that he should be subject to these feelings once again. 'We will do everything we can to ensure Robbie gets the support he deserves.' Mr Clark is one of Britain's oldest surviving prisoners of war \u00a0- and one of the few British soldiers to survive Hitler's 1,000-mile death march - has been given the emergency grant through the Help for Heroes quick reaction fund. Having spent his savings on home care, Mr Clark, from Brent, north west London, faced being forced out of his home into a residential care home, something he said would 'remind me of being a prisoner of war'. Mr Clark is blind, deaf in one ear and dependent on a wheelchair, suffered 'severe anxiety' when he was a prisoner of war. A total of 165,000 people have signed a petition calling for home help, the charity said. More than \u00a32,500 has been donated on a JustGiving fundraising page. Mr Clark was a gunner in the Durham Light Infantry when he was captured by the Nazis in the North African city of Tobruk in June 1942. He spent the rest of the war in prison camps in Poland, before being forced to join the \u2018death march\u2019 in 1945. Hitler ordered thousands of PoWs to march west for four months in extreme winter weather as the Russians advanced from the East. Writing home: Veteran Robert Clark, pictured in 1940, when he was serving with Durham Light Infantry. Robert Clark (front row, second left) pictured on June 21, 1943 at prisoner of war camp Campo PG70 in Italy. After the war, the soldier married his sweetheart Rita and worked as a carpenter. In 1969 the couple moved into the house where he still lives in Burnt Oak, north London. Mrs Clark died in 2010 aged 91. Now a great-great-grandfather and one of Britain\u2019s oldest surviving PoWs, Mr Clark is registered blind, deaf in one ear and is dependent on a wheelchair. For the past two years he has used his \u00a350,000 savings to pay towards a \u00a3960-a-week live-in carer, while Brent Council contributed \u00a3350 a week. But as his money runs out, the council is refusing to increase its funding and Mr Clark may have to go into a care home instead. His son, Mike, who said his home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, is not suitable for the pensioner, added: \u2018This is causing my father to be very anxious and he is unable to sleep. \u2018He\u2019s as good as told me that if he has to move, he\u2019ll just give up on life. Whenever he\u2019s been in hospital, he \u2026 pulls the blankets over his head and stops talking. \u2018He hates being anywhere which isn\u2019t familiar \u2026 going into a care home will be like going back into a prisoner of war camp.\u2019 Despite tens of thousands signing the petition to allow Mr Clark to stay in his own home, Brent Council said they will not increase their funding for a live-in carer. The council\u2019s Phil Porter said: \u2018We recognise Mr Clark\u2019s contribution to this country and sincerely empathise with the situation that he and other older people \u2026 are in. \u2018However \u2026 the care package that Mr Clark is choosing is not affordable to council taxpayers given the constraints of local government funding and the need to be consistent for the 2,900 people we support.\u2019 He added: \u2018Mr Clark owns his home, so there is absolutely no question of Brent Council evicting him despite what has been suggested in this petition.\u2019 The council said Mr Clark\u2019s needs can be met in a care home for \u00a3451 a week. Alternatively, he could choose to receive the same weekly sum and stay at home, but would have to pay the extra amount necessary for a carer. Mr Porter said: \u2018We want to find a solution which meets his eligible social care needs, provides value for money for the taxpayer, but also reflects the choices he has made and the additional cost this creates.\u2019 He added that the council had offered \u2018a deferred payment which means he doesn\u2019t need to sell his house to pay for his care\u2019. After signatures hit the 127,000 mark this morning, a spokeswoman said: 'Our position hasn't changed since the petition was at 75,000.' Mr Clark\u2019s family reported the case to the Local Government Ombudsman, but the watchdog agreed with the council.\n","right_summary":"Great-grandfather Robert Clark has lived in the house for 50 years.

{"document":"They are the remnant of a bygone era, when Sultan's ruled one of the world's oldest empires, living in a forgotten age of\u00a0opulence\u00a0and\u00a0extravagance in India's\u00a0immense palace estates. But when the Duke of Wellington 's forces defeated and killed Tipu Sultan, the Tiger of Mysore, in 1799, troops plundered the city and the palace, returning to Britain with gold, jewellery, arms, armour, clothing and even Tipu's grand throne. This month, a collection of the historic\u00a0artefacts from this exotic empire will go on sale at London auction house Bonhams, and experts expect them to fetch a total of around \u00a31million. Pure opulence: A gem-set sword with pink, green and red stones and an ornate tiger's head pommel is expected to sell for \u00a380,000. This rare quilted helmet with a gold koftgari bar, incredibly artistic stitching and the wonderfully bright colours of India is set to sell for \u00a335,000. Great adversaries: The Tiger of Mysore, Tipu Sultan, left, and army general,\u00a0Arthur Wellesley, right, fought in India in 1799. War was waged after spies intercepted a letter from the Sultan proposing an alliance with the French. Wellesley went on to become the Duke of Wellington, defeating Napolean in the Battle of Waterloo. But he earned his stripes fighting in Mysore and rushed to check the sultan's pulse when he was killed. The item tipped to attract the biggest price is the Sultan's personal sporting gun, a four-foot-long rifle made by his own armoury, tipped to make \u00a3150,000 alone. It was given as a present to Lord Cornwallis, the Governor General of India, after the fall of Tipu and passed on to the Earls of Pembroke, staying in the family for 200 years. A gold-coloured gem-set sword with an artistic tiger's head pommel showing the craftsmanship of 18th-century Mysore is expected to sell for \u00a380,000. An archer's set, made for Tipu, includes a beautiful gold and red embroidered quiver and arm guards, a belt with a finely-forged buckle and seven decorated arrows. It's expected to sell for \u00a360,000. The collection also includes a rare quilted helmet with a gold koftgari bar, stitched with a finely detailed pattern and the wonderfully bright colours associated with India, which is set to sell for \u00a335,000. One of the prize pieces is an artistically carved hardwood tiger-paw from the foot of Tipu's throne - the only surviving piece of the once magnificent structure - which could make \u00a320,000. Bidders can buy a piece of history with a Mughal gem-set jade plaque, complete with a note stating it was found with the body of Tipu Sultan in 1799 after he died on the battlefield. Other items up for sale include pistols, helmets, swords, intricately embroidered clothing and even a bronze field cannon used to defend the fortress at Seringapatam. Atop of an empire: This historic picture shows what Tipu's magnificent throne would have looked like before he was toppled. On sale in the auction is the only surviving piece of the magnificent throne, a decoratively carved tiger foot with a silver plaque celebrating the victory. Foot of the throne: A carved wood tiger paw from the foot of the throne of Tipu Sultan, expected to sell for \u00a320,000. Medal of honour: The silver plaque atop the foot of the throne commemorates the victory over one of the greatest sultans in history. A golden age: This embroidered quiver and arm guards, belt and seven decorated arrows, made for Tipu, is expected to sell for \u00a360,000. The items were collected over 30 years by\u00a0British Tipu expert Robin Wigington, who even turned part of his house in Stratford Upon Avon into a museum and allowed some of them to be displayed in exhibitions worldwide. He sold his collection to a private collector in 2005 and they have now been put up for sale again. Claire Penhallurick, head of Islamic and Indian art at Bonhams, said:\u00a0'It is very unusual for there to be an auction of so many artefacts that once belonged to Tipu. It is the product of one man who collected for nearly 30 years. 'Robin Wigington was an arms and armour gentleman dealer who collected these pieces over three decades. He was obsessed with Tipu - he published pieces and loaned items to major exhibitions. 'In the end he built his own museum at his home in Stratford Upon Avon which was open for six years, during which time it won an award for the best British museum. 'One of the highlights of this sale is one of the feet that Tipu's throne rested on. 'Quite a few of the items are signed and dated by the manufacturer, making them incredibly important historical documents because it allows other items from the same era to be dated. 'Many of the pieces have previous metal inlays and incredibly decorative touches. It's very obvious they're Tipu's pieces. 'Wigington had an eye for quality and he collected the best of the best. These items are not just arms and armour but far more than that - they're works of art. Storming of Seringapatam under General Baird and death of Tipu Sultan, May 4, 1799, in the Mysore War.\u00a0Tipu Sultan was shot and killed in the onslaught. Wellington was a 30-year-old army general when he led troops to Mysore in the late 18th century. Then a young Arthur Wellesley, he earned his stripes and learned skills fighting Tipu, nicknamed the Tiger of Mysore, that would later prove vital in defeating French dictator Napoleon on the battlefields of Waterloo. His elder brother Richard Wellesley, the British Governor General, had waged war against the sultan after a spy intercepted a letter from Napoleon proposing an alliance. It was to be the fourth war between the Brits and the southern Indian kingdom of Mysore in just over 30 years. Wellesley led the British army into Tipu's stronghold of Seringapatam, the capital of Mysore, on April 5 1799 with the military planning and precision that came to be his strongest attributes. More than two decades letter Wellesley, by then the Duke of Wellington, used the same skills he had learned against Tipu Sultan to crush Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. After several weeks of besieging the city the Brits were able to breach the walls of its fortress. Tipu Sultan was shot and killed in the onslaught, and Wellesley dashed to the scene to check his pulse. Weelington went on to become one of the most famed leaders in military history. 'Tipu Sultan was one of the greatest rulers in Indian history, but interest in him comes from all over the world.' 'He was the first adversary of General Arthur Wellesley, who went on to become the Duke of Wellington. 'It would be fair to say Wellesley learned the skills he later displayed at the Battle of Waterloo fighting against Tipu, although Tipu gave the Brits a good run for their money. 'After the fall of Tipu the British took over his palace and some of his items were divided up among officers. 'A series of auctions were held over three days in Seringapatam where more treasures were sold. 'Some of these items we are selling could have come from these auctions, or they could have been gifted to officers at the time. 'Many of the pieces have 200-year provenances in the UK. 'Some were personal weapons of Tipu's - one such is a huge gun with a crouching tiger carved into the butt which was gifted to Lord Cornwallis after the fall of Seringapatam.

The Duke of Wellington's handwritten orders from the Battle of Waterloo and a pair of the original 'Wellington boots' are among items in two exhibitions to mark the 200th anniversary of the conflict. English Heritage is putting on new displays at Wellington Arch at Hyde Park Corner and nearby Apsley House, the London home of the first Duke of Wellington, who commanded the army that defeated Napolean in modern day Belgium in 1815. They mark the bicentenary of the battle in which British and Prussian forces finally defeated Bonaparte, bringing an end to conflict which had raged in Europe and the wider world for 20 years. At Wellington's former home, Apsley House, which dates back to the 1770s, visitors will be able see the Waterloo Gallery as it was when he hosted annual banquets to commemorate the battle. Josephine Oxley, keeper of the Wellington collection, said visitors would be able to find out about the man behind the battle and also see the scale of the banquets which took place every year from 1820 until the duke died in 1852. 'Once the Waterloo Gallery was finished in 1828, the banquets expanded and became very glamorous affairs, so much so there were crowds outside, it was the red carpet event of its day.'\n","right_summary":"30-year-old Duke of Wellington fought Tipu Sultan as an army general in 1799.

{"document":"A mother of a baby boy was arrested 27 years after his body was found wrapped in a blanket inside a Sainsbury's bag floating on a village pond. Police exhumed the boy's body from his grave in Norfolk last year after the case came up for periodical review. A DNA sample eventually led them to his mother. The woman, who has not been named, was arrested on suspicion of infanticide but the charge was dropped after she explained how the baby had been stillborn and that she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends. She explained how she had placed her dead baby in the pond in the village of Weasenham St Peter on June 5, 1988, just a few days before it was found by teenagers on a Sunday afternoon outing. Scroll down for video. Unsolved case: A police officer searches Windmill Pit, the Norfolk pond where the baby boy's body was found back in 1988. The boy's body was exhumed by officers as part of a case review, with DNA samples leading police to the boy's mother. He has now been reburied at Weasenham St Peter church, Norfolk. Police said they have ruled out any foul play and the woman remains on bail while the CPS decide whether to charge her with failing to register a birth and preventing a lawful burial. During the original investigation, police had been unable to identify the mother and villagers carried out a collection to raise money to pay for the baby's burial at 13th century St Peter's Church in the village. A report in the Eastern Daily Press from 1988 tells how the body was found floating on the pond. But after the body was exhumed in April last year, DNA taken from his leg bone was put through the national police database which found a match for a possible relative of one of the parents. Detectives examined that person's family tree and identified the woman who admitted being the boy's mother. A police spokesman said: 'In this case it was not clear how the baby died despite a post mortem examination and the circumstances surrounding the death remained the focus of the investigation. 'Thanks to advances in DNA we were able to trace the mother of the baby and during interview the woman revealed she had concealed her pregnancy from family and friends and delivered the baby by herself. 'Sadly the baby was delivered stillborn and we are satisfied there was no third party involvement or foul play.' Det Insp Andy Guy, of Norfolk Police who led the investigation said the DNA was compared to five million samples on the national database. He said: 'It came back with a match of a family member and by looking at that family we were able to find a lady of the right age. 'We went to see that individual and she told us she was mum. She was arrested on suspicion of infanticide. 'We were then given an account by the lady concerned who gave details about the birth and details only the mother would know to myself and the officer who interviewed her. 'The pregnancy was concealed from everybody. She didn't tell her family, her close friends, she gave birth in secret. The baby was stillborn.' The woman told officers how she placed her dead baby in the pond, known locally as Windmill Pit, before it was found by a group of teenagers. The boy was originally buried without a name but \u00a0a support group for parents of stillborn children raised the money for a new headstone giving his name as Peter after the name of the church. A second post-mortem carried out on the remains last year found no evidence of foul play. An inquest held in 1988 body also failed to establish a cause of death. The baby boy was re-buried in the churchyard on June 5 last year - the 26th anniversary of his discovery - he was named Peter after the name of the church. Det Insp Guy said police were now satisfied that nobody else had been involved at the time. He added: 'This has been unsolved for 27 years. By using the latest techniques, we've solved something which has been a mystery for a long time.' 'We don't ever give up. All the unsolved cases we have going back to the 60s are still on our books and they're reviewed at regular intervals.' Det Insp Guy said the small team of officers involved in the case had 'mixed feelings' after bringing the investigation to a final close. He said: 'From a police officer's perspective, it's fantastic. From a human perspective you can only have empathy for the woman and imagine how terrible it was for her.' The grave of the baby was originally marked by a simple wooden cross, which read: 'In loving memory of unknown baby boy. Born and died 1988.' A support group called Hana's Gift for families who have suffered a stillbirth has now paid for a new headstone giving his name as Peter. The inscription reads: 'In loving memory of baby Peter, June 1988. A sweet little child, lost but then found, to bloom and grow in Heaven's playground. There is no foot so small that it cannot leave an imprint on the world.' Tranquil: The pond in the village of Weasenham St Peter, Norfolk, as it is today. Karen Murray-Tye who set up Hana's gift charity after her daughter was stillborn in 2006, said: 'It was quite hard to find the right words, but I thought the 'lost but found' fitted the circumstances. 'I hope she sees we've tried to do the best for him as we have for Hana. It would be lovely if it made her think she could have some support if she came forward.' Norfolk coroner's chaplain Chris Copsey said: 'When the coffin was exhumed all that was left was a little plaque that said 'unnamed baby boy'. 'It seemed terrible to bury an unnamed baby boy so I took the name of the church, St Peter's church.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n","right_summary":"Baby boy's remains were exhumed last year after case came up for review.

{"document":"Is there anything laser can't do? From cutting diamonds to preserving endangered sites, all the way to building terrifying weapons and turning your eyes from brown to blue, there is apparently no end to the list of applications for laser. Swiss physicist Jean-Pierre Wolf is working on yet another impressive addition to that list: using focused laser beams to affect the weather. It sounds like black magic, but it's actually a cleaner version of cloud seeding, a form of weather modification that has been used for several years -- most famously by China in preparation for the 2008 Olympics, when they launched rockets to seed the clouds and prevent rainfall during the opening ceremony. But it's hard to tell how effective cloud seeding actually is, and it involves the spraying of chemicals into the atmosphere, something which it surely doesn't need. Laser is therefore a completely clean alternative to traditional cloud seeding: it's light, and nothing but light. How does laser actually affect the weather? Just like cloud seeding, it can create new clouds where there are none, by inducing condensation: naturally occurring water vapor is condensed into droplets, and ice crystals form, mimicking the natural process that creates clouds. That way, rainfall can be triggered to \"empty\" the atmosphere and increase the potential of dry weather later on: \"We did it on a laboratory scale, we can already create clouds, but not on a macroscopic scale, so you don't see a big cloud coming out because the laser is not powerful enough and because of a lot of technical parameters that we can't yet control,\" Professor Wolf told CNN's Nick Glass. That is not to say that the laser he's tested isn't powerful: at one terawatt, it has the same energy produced by all the nuclear power plants on Earth: \"Of course, it doesn't last very long,\" Wolf said. The technology is still in its infancy then, but once it's perfected, it could help us modulate the weather in areas of high contrast, such as California or Chile, where flooding and droughts occur in extreme vicinity. Through lasers, those effects could be smoothed to have less rain in flooding-prone areas and more rain in drought-prone areas: \"You can transport the water to a different location,\" Wolf said. Laser seeding can make more than clouds: it can also trigger lightning. \"We also showed that it's possible to trigger lightning in clouds, within clouds, but not to the ground, yet.\" Recent tests have shown promise: \" A few years ago, in New Mexico, we moved our big mobile terawatt laser to the top of a mountain and we shot it up into the atmosphere, trying to trigger lightning. We didn't, but we could see some small discharge, lightning, within the cloud. You know, 90 per cent of the lightning discharge are intra-cloud, not against the Earth. So, we are still working on that, but there is hope.\" Controlling lightning, or facilitating its discharge in a desired location, would help reduce the costs associated with lightning damage -- they run into the billions of dollars each year, adding to thousands of people injured or killed by lightning strikes. Affecting the weather could also turn out to be one of our best bets at limiting the impact of climate change. Professor Wolf reckons lasers could be used to \"repair\" the weather, reducing the occurrence of hurricanes, thunderstorms, flooding, and drought. But his laser technology can look way beyond the clouds: \"There are potential applications in the biomedical field: by changing the color of the laser, we could identify and selectively kill cancer cells, with little or no collateral damage.\" Yet another potential application to add to that list: \"Every time you think you have done everything you can with lasers, something new comes up: it's quite amazing.\"\n","right_summary":"Swiss Professor Jean-Pierre Wolf is pioneering the use of lasers to affect the weather. He suggests lasers could also be used to limit the impact of climate change.\n","hallucinated_summary":"With the use of focused laser beams, Swiss physicist Jean-Pierre Wolf hopes to control and redirect hurricanes, as well as selectively kill cancer cells with no human casualties."}
{"document":"A three-year-old boy has been accused of killing his mother by pushing her down a lift shaft in China by one of their neighbours. Xie Hong Feng was found dead after falling five floors down an empty elevator shaft in her apartment block in Ningbo City in China. Her neighbour and property manager Yang Shao told police the 45-year-old had been pushed by her toddler son, The People\u2019s Daily Online reported. Xie Hong Feng, pictured, died after falling down five floors through a lift shaft. Her three-year-old son has been accused of pushing her by the property's manager - but there is no CCTV evidence of the accident. CCTV image inside the lift shows Ms Xie with her three-year-old son. She dropped her keys in the gap between the elevator and the fourth floor, and went to the property manager for help retrieving them. The drama started when Ms Xie, in her mid-forties, went to Yang with her child for help after she dropped her key down the gap between the lift and the fourth floor, where she lived. All three got the lift to the fifth floor, and Yang, 52, pressed the button for the sixth floor. According to police statements, Yang said she used the triangular lock necessary to open the lift doors and told Ms Xie to be careful as she looked for her keys because it was very dark. When Ms Xie did not reply, Yang asked her son \u2018Where is your mother?\u2019 He answered \u2018Pushed down!\u2019, and Yang called the police. There is no CCTV outside the elevator, and police say Yang\u2019s statement is the only evidence. Ms Xie\u2019s husband was on a business trip when the tragic accident occurred, and one of Ms Xie\u2019s male relatives said they are not convinced that the child pushed his mother into the shaft. Property manager Yang said Ms Xie's three-year-old son pushed her down lift shaft to her death. Investigators have brought into question why she had the authority to open the lift doors and whether she acted properly. A lift maintenance engineer claimed that property manager Yang acted illegally by opening the lift doors manually. The relatives of victim Ms Xie said they are not convinced her son pushed and killed his mother. Yang told reporters outside her home: \u2018She [Ms Xie] told me that she dropped her keys in the gap. I said I will help her get it. \u2018The lift doors open when we were on the fifth floor and then the child pushed his mother down to the shaft.\u2019 The administration of work safety of Ningbo City was called in to help police investigate the cause of the accident, and they have already ruled out a malfunction of the lift. Officers are questioning why, if Ms Xie dropped her keys on the fourth floor, the group travelled to the fifth floor. Questions have also been raised over whether property staff have the authority to open the lift doors, and officers are looking at whether Yang was properly qualified to handle the lifts. Chen Zhewei, the Ningbo City Yinzhou property manager, told reporters from The People\u2019s Daily Online that because of a lack of lift maintenance companies 10 years ago, some residential areas decided to train their staff on the use of elevators so they could deal with emergency situations. Nowadays the majority of lift maintenance and safety is outsourced to specialist companies. The fact that Yang opened the lift doors with a triangular lock is illegal, a lift maintenance engineer added, and there are very strict procedures that should be adhered to when manually opening a lift doors. These include turning off the electricity supply to the lift and keeping the triangular lock in a secure place.\n","right_summary":"Three-year-old accused of murder by the apartment block manager.

{"document":"Raheem Sterling is earning less than Mario Balotelli. In fact he's earning less than half of what Balotelli is on at Liverpool. Puts a few things into perspective doesn't it? Liverpool Football Club have made some poor decisions in terms of signings and contracts since Luis Suarez departed, and those mistakes look set to cost them their place in the top four. For Brendan Rodgers' sake whoever is in charge of sorting out Sterling's new contract this summer needs to get it right. If they think they can afford to lose Suarez, Gerrard and Sterling in the space of 12 months they are very much mistaken. Raheem Sterling's contract negotiations have dominated the headlines in the past fortnight. Sterling shares a laugh in training ahead of Liverpool's FA Cup replay with Blackburn on Wednesday. Mario Balotelli earns more than double Sterling at present despite failing to perform in a Liverpool shirt. Sterling's agent has been accused of giving him bad advice. Apparently what people want his agent to tell him is that he's not particularly good, he's too young to earn big money, and he should sign whatever contract Liverpool offer him because he should be grateful just to even be there. The advice the agent gave was to turn down the contract offer and focus on football until the summer. Sounds reasonable to me. The big problem here is not the tired old narrative of a young greedy footballer. It's that Liverpool, through Rodgers, have repeatedly told the press and the fans that there would be no problem and Sterling would sign the new deal. In the middle of December, Rodgers described Sterling as 'a talisman' and told us he was confident he would stay. At the end of January, Rodgers told us the contract would be 'concluded imminently'. Last month he described the new offer to Sterling as 'incredible'. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has always insisted that the Sterling talks would be concluded soon. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal, admitting he was 'flattered' by their interest. Rodgers has repeatedly insisted that Sterling will not be moving anywhere this summer. Liverpool find themselves seven points adrift in the race for the Champions League places. Rodgers has said things there he had no right to say, but those assurances he gave have now served to make Sterling and his agent out to be the bad guys. The astonished response of hypocritical ex-pros and pundits stuck in an era where the maximum wage still exists was blown up beyond proportion. 'How dare this greedy young man who's won nothing, scored less goals than Jon Walters (who thought that one up?) turn down this incredible offer from this great club. He should be grateful to be at such a club.' This was the standard response from people out of touch with the modern game. The 'incredible' deal was actually an offer which put Sterling on a par with Balotelli. Liverpool Football Club should be embarrassed by that offer to Raheem Sterling, a player who kept quiet last summer when he watched Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Balotelli all walk through the door and sign deals worth more than double what he was on. He then stayed quiet while his performances were being scrutinised more than most in the absence of Suarez and Sturridge, with Lallana injured at the start of the campaign and with Gerrard fading fast. Adam Lallana has been hindered by injuries since he arrived at Anfield from Southampton last summer. Dejan Lovren also arrived at Liverpool from Southampton in the summer and earns more than Sterling. The departure of Steven Gerrard to the MLS this summer will free up space on Liverpool's wage bill. Meantime Rodgers said there would be no issue with Sterling signing again, so when it turned out there was a problem, Sterling was instantly the bad guy, along with his agent. Now the message from those who want to bring Sterling down is that he's not very good. 'He's not good enough to move to a bigger club' (since when were Liverpool a small club by the way?) 'He would be stuck on the bench if he moved.' 'Coutinho is better.' 'Let him go, Jordan Ibe is coming through.' If people want to believe all that it's up to them, but it won't alter these facts:. Steven Gerrard and Glen Johnson are set to leave this summer which will free up a huge amount of the wages budget at Anfield. Philippe Coutinho would provide an alternative should Sterling depart Anfield in the summer. The emergence of teenage winger Jordon Ibe also suggests there could be life beyond Sterling at Liverpool. Sterling should be playing Champions League football - something Liverpool may not offer next season. Gerrard knows all about contract situations not being addressed, and that's why he said two months ago that the club need to sort out the futures of Sterling and Henderson 'before it's too late'. It was an important message from the captain that got lost in all the negative spin aimed at bringing Sterling and his agent's credibility down. The last two defeats have brought the debate back to where it should be: the mistakes made by Rodgers and Liverpool. Ramping up the hate towards a young English player who wants to play in the Champions League and wants to earn significantly more than a total waste of space like Mario Balotelli will hopefully now be seen for what it is \u2013 a way of deflecting from the real issues at Anfield. What's really disappointing is that a young talented player has had to put up with all this criticism. It's classically English I'm afraid. Those critics should be ashamed of themselves. Seriously - imagine if Real Madrid do want Sterling this summer, as Liverpool prepare for a Europa League campaign. Would it be good advice to turn down that move?\n","right_summary":"Raheem Sterling is currently earning less than half Mario Balotelli's salary. Even signing new \u00a3100,000-a-week deal would only take him to parity. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has insisted Sterling will put pen to paper. But he has assumed he'll stay at Liverpool when he has other ambitions. Sterling should be playing in the Champions League. And Liverpool, seven points off fourth place, may not be able to offer that. Adrian Durham: Arsenal only turn it on when the pressure is off. Durham: Rooney and Carrick are Man Utd's only players with the 'football intelligence' demanded by Louis van Gaal. CLICK HERE for all the latest Liverpool news. Raheem Sterling is a very good player. He's been performing at a high level consistently for two seasons. If a club is prepared to pay \u00a350m he would play regularly for them. There would be no shortage of clubs wanting to sign him \u2013 Real Madrid have already said they are monitoring his situation. Rodgers says they won't sell this summer, but it's more bluster I'm afraid. Common sense dictates they can't afford to let his contract run down to its final year. The situation needs to be addressed. Sterling wants to play Champions League football. What's so wrong with that?\n","hallucinated_summary":"Raheem Sterling's contract situation has caused a rift between the player, his agent, and Liverpool management. Despite being offered an 'incredible' deal, Sterling has turned down the contract offer and the club's future with the player is uncertain. The club's recent mistakes in terms of signings and contracts have cost them their top spot and Liverpool should be embarrassed by their offer to Sterling, especially given players like Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, and Mario Balotelli are earning significantly more than him. With Steven Gerrard's departure from the club, there may be space on Liverpool's wage bill for Sterling, but there's no guarantee that he will stay. Sterling deserves credit for standing up for himself and wanting to play Champions League football, and Liverpool should reconsider their offer to keep a talented young player happy."}

{"document":"Ed Miliband last night repeatedly refused to admit he had got it wrong over the past five years about jobs, crime and the effect of tuition fees. Labour has previously confidently predicted that the Coalition's austerity programme would see unemployment and crime soar, and the number of poor students going to university fall. But, in each case, the opposite has happened \u2013 and last night the party's leader was challenged over whether this called into question the judgment of him and his team. Scroll down for video. The Labour leader rejected a string of statistics read out by Evan Davis on how the situation in all three cases had improved \u2013 saying these facts were not what voters were talking about. Mr Miliband repeatedly refused to admit he had got it wrong over the past five years about jobs, fees and crime. Mr Miliband replied: 'I don't think that's a judgment that people are going to make at the election.' The refusal to accept that he had been proved wrong since the election came in a combative interview with Evan Davis on the BBC's Newsnight. The Labour leader rejected a string of statistics read out by Mr Davis on how the situation in all three cases had improved \u2013 saying these facts were not what voters were talking about. Mr Miliband also refused to say how much Labour would be borrowing by the end of the next Parliament, saying: 'The way you get credibility is not by picking out an arbitrary number in six years' time.' And he gave the strongest indication yet that Ed Balls would be Chancellor in a Labour-led government. Mr Davis brought up the subject of Mr Balls' comment four years ago that it was 'fantasy' to think Britain would get job growth with all the cuts being made in the public sector. He asked the Labour leader: 'What's happened to jobs over the last five years?' Mr Miliband replied: 'What Ed Balls was doing was quoting what the Office of Budget Responsibility were saying, which is there'd be a very, very big impact on public sector jobs, and there were deep questions about whether the private sector jobs could make up the shortfall.' The Newsnight presenter challenged Mr Miliband on jobs, crimes and fees - but the Labour leader refused to admit he had got it wrong on each occasion. In the interview, Mr Miliband\u00a0refused to say how much Labour would be borrowing by the end of the next Parliament. When Mr Davis said he wanted to 'focus on the number of jobs', Mr Miliband had to admit: 'The number of jobs has gone up, but you know, I'm going to let people in this election make the judgment about whether that means the economy's fixed or not.' Mr Davis interjected: 'It's gone up by two million, hasn't it? About a thousand a day.' The presenter then moved on to crime; quoting shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper who said earlier this Parliament that the cuts are 'risking public safety and the fight against crime'. When asked what had happened to crime, Mr Miliband at first answered: 'Violent crime's actually up. So there are worries about violent crime. And there are big questions about what's going to happen to policing in the next parliament.' Mr Davis then asked him twice: 'What's happened to crime overall?', forcing Mr Miliband to reply: 'You're definitely right that there are a number of statistics that the Government cites to say everything's fine in the country and everything's doing well. Certain areas of crime have gone down; certain areas of crime have gone up. But let's go to the big argument of this election.' Mr Miliband gave the strongest indication yet that Ed Balls would be Chancellor in a Labour-led government. Chuka Umunna said he believed one in seven company directors should be from ethnic minority backgrounds \u2013 reflecting the population. The shadow business secretary told the London Evening Standard he would support an official target for boardroom diversity. During an LBC Radio phone-in he was asked if he would either stand as a candidate for Labour leader or London Mayor. He said he had 'no interest' in being mayor. Pressed on the leadership, he replied: 'I'm not getting into that conversation at all.' The presenter interrupted him again to point out that the crime survey of England and Wales showed it was at its lowest level since 1981. Mr Davis then moved on to the rise in tuition fees, quoting Chuka Umunna saying in 2010: 'How can these proposals do other than deter people from poor backgrounds from going to university?' Mr Miliband said: 'What I know is that there are 12 times more people from advantaged, privileged backgrounds going to university than disadvantaged backgrounds. And that isn't good enough for me and the country.' After the Labour leader declined twice to say what had actually happened to rates of enrolment from poorer students, Mr Davis told him the number had in fact increased by around a third. Mr Miliband replied: 'There are some more people going to university from different backgrounds. So the problem's fixed is it?' Asked: 'The judgment that was made was wrong?', he replied: 'No, it wasn't wrong. It isn't good enough for me that you're 12 times more likely to get to university from an advantaged compared to a disadvantaged background.' Mr Davis asked: 'So on issues about jobs, crime, social mobility, comments, predictions made by people in your team turn out to have been wrong. These are important areas. 'These are not minor quibbles are they? These are huge issues that have had a large part to play in the last five years.' \u25a0Fuel duty would rise 'in line with inflation' under Labour, climate change spokesman Caroline Flint said yesterday. The last Labour government introduced the fuel duty escalator which saw the price of a litre of unleaded petrol rise by RPI inflation plus one pence. However, under the Coalition it was frozen for a fifth year in succession, allowing the Chancellor to boast that motorists have had '\u00a310 off a tank with the Tories'.\n","right_summary":"Ed Miliband refused to accept he had been proved wrong in BBC interview.

{"document":"A married dentist forced his practice nurse to resign after she rejected his attempts to kiss her, a tribunal heard. Colin Cromie told Xara Grogan, 29, they should jet to Barcelona for a break and claimed they were both stuck with the wrong partner. But when she turned down his advances their working relationship soured and Mr Cromie, 49, became increasingly hostile and unfriendly. He would also snatch instruments from her in the surgery and be \u2018abrupt and rude\u2019 and blamed her for a fall-out with another dental practice. Married dentist Colin Cromie (left), 49, forced practice nurse Xara Grogan (right), 29, to resign after she rejected his attempts to kiss her, a tribunal heard. When Miss Grogan complained about having to wear a uniform, including culottes, Mr Cromie, a former major in the Royal Army Dental Corps, told her she would be \u2018out on her ear\u2019 if she joined a union, it was alleged. On another occasion as she was helping a dental technician to organise a quote for dentures, Mr Cromie shouted at her and told her she should \u2018know her place\u2019. And on a separate occasion Mr Cromie gave Miss Grogan a dressing-down for failing to set up the practice\u2019s reception, when a colleague who arrived late went unpunished. Mr Cromie made life so unpleasant the nurse was later forced to quit the job she had held for more than five years. The tribunal found Miss Grogan was constructively dismissed by Mr Cromie and his conduct towards the nurse did amount to sex discrimination. But she failed in her bid to prove further allegations of harassment and victimisation against the dentist. She was awarded \u00a316,500 compensation for the dismissal and \u2018hurt feelings\u2019 as well as back pay that she was owed. Workplace: Mr Cromie hired Miss Grogan to work at Petre Dental, pictured, in Lancashire. The hearing was told Miss Grogan had worked for Mr Cromie in two spells from 2008 in two separate practices he had set up. She had been in a relationship with Mr Cromie\u2019s stepson, Paul Talbot, and the pair had lived with the dentist and his wife. But relations between the dentist and his nurse began to change when Mr Cromie began sharing \u2018sexist\u2019 jokes with her via text message and then offered to take her to Barcelona. He told Miss Grogan, who had been arguing with her partner, that they were each with the wrong partners and attempted to hug and kiss her. Miss Grogan (above) initially complained to the practice manager, Diane Talbot \u2013 Mr Cromie\u2019s wife \u2013 and became frustrated when no action was taken.

Mr Cromie denied trying to kiss the nurse but employment judge Katherine Ross said: \u2018Mr Cromie absolutely denied the allegation. The claimant said it occurred. The tribunal finds that the incident occurred.\u2019 The tribunal was told that shortly after the incident Miss Grogan was so shocked she told a fellow dental nurse, Louise Clail. In her ruling Judge Ross added: \u2018Although there had been a high degree of familiarity between Mr Cromie and the claimant, based on her position in the extended family, their close working relationship and the sexual language which passed between them, attempting to kiss the claimant was an action which was physical and sexual.\u2019 After the case Miss Grogan said on Facebook that the case had represented \u2018a tough couple of years\u2019 and she was looking forward to moving on. She added: \u2018He will do it again I don\u2019t doubt it. I would hope he treats the girls he works with now with a little more respect.\u2019 Mr Cromie said Miss Grogan had only succeeded in \u2018two out of six\u2019 claims and this was reflected in her \u2018modest\u2019 pay-out.\n","right_summary":"Colin Cromie hired his stepson's girlfriend Xara Grogan as a dental nurse.

{"document":"David Cameron has brushed off criticism that he is too posh, insisting he will not change the way he acts or speaks to win voters. The Prime Minister is apparently so proud to be posh he was happy to be pictured eating a hotdog with a knife and fork. The bizarre dining etiquette during a campaign visit to Dorset was almost certainly designed to avoid a repeat of Ed Miliband's disastrous attempt at eating a bacon sandwich. Scroll down for video. David Cameron ate his hotdog with cutlery as he enjoyed lunch with Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota in the sunshine during a visit to Poole in Dorset. It seems likely that Mr Cameron was trying to avoid the fate of Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was much mocked for his attempt to eat a bacon sandwich on the campaign trail last year. Few people can appear attractive while eating in public, but on the campaign trail a combination of hunger and not wishing to cause offence to hosts means it can be tricky to avoid. Mr Cameron's pitstop at a garden in Poole, Dorset yesterday include a spot of a lunch. The Tory leader loaded his plate with potato salad, cucumber, tomato and a hotdog before settling down next to Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota. But he surprised onlookers with his eating style, picking up a knife and fork to chop the hotdog. The PM has a chequered history with hotdogs. In 2010 he caused offence on a visit to New York when he asked for a plain sausage, without even onions.

Colin Barnett, the Premier for Western Australian (pictured), has sparked outrage after saying 'some good' has come out of the year-long search for missing Malaysia Airline. Search parties have not been successful in recovering MH370 since it disappeared on March 8 last year. Its more than a year since the day Perth father Paul Weeks (right) boarded the Beijing-bound flight in Kuala Lumpur. But his wife Danica Weeks (left) is still at a loss about what to tell her young boys. 'Sometimes knowledge can come from unexpected sources,' Mr Barnett said yesterday. 'While that [the MH370 disappearance] is a great human tragedy there will be some good come out of it and the knowledge of the deep sea, and the seabed conditions will probably exceed anywhere in the world.' He continued to say that volcanoes have been discovered as well as fresh water lakes and waterfalls. Mr Barnett also added the search has helped uncover 'features of the marine bed that many did not believe was likely to exist'.

{"document":"Manchester  City manager Manuel Pellegrini has admitted his club will have to buy young talent because the Academy's youngsters are not ready for first-team action. Liverpool star Raheem Sterling has already had his name linked with the defending Premier League champions after his contract stalemate at Anfield. Part of the pressure on City to land fresh young talent comes from FA chairman Greg Dyke's proposal to increase the quota of homegrown players to 12 in Premier League squads. Manuel Pellegrini doesn't believe his current crop of Academy players are up to joining Yaya Toure and Co. Manchester City keeper Joe Hart makes a save during training on Wednesday. Wilfried Bony is more likely to be joined by a young star such as Raheem Sterling than an Academy player. And, with the Blues having failed to produce any regular homegrown first team squad members since Micah Richards and Dedryck Boyata, Pellegrini admits the short-term answer to the need for the new talent does not lie within the squad. Pellegrini said: 'I think about the Academy, we must be patient. This club build all these things because young players are important. 'Maybe it's not so easy for young players, especially at big clubs, to play in the first team, with the professional squad. 'I'm sure in the future we will have very important players coming from the Academy, they will be part of the squad. 'But it's important to be patient, important to have years of working the same way. But you never know. Maybe some talented young players can do it before.' Pellegrini says he is sure the Academy will produce players worthy of his side but urges patience for now. Sterling (here with Brendan Rodgers) would fit the bill for City if his impasse with Liverpool isn't resolved. Sterling would obviously fit the bill and qualify as one of Dyke's homegrown quota if his impasse at Liverpool proves unsolvable. Pellegrini refused to comment directly about the Liverpool and England forward. But he said: 'I think it's important for big clubs to bring in the best players, that's the most important thing. 'If they're all good players, of course I agree with the quota. All the big leagues - especially the Premier League - need the best players to play.' City's need to add 'homegrown' or 'English' players to their squad has seen them linked with a host of top stars, including Arsenal's Jack Wilshere and Ross Barkley of Everton. Arsenal's Jack Wilshere, who's coming back from injury through the reserves, has attracted City's interest. Everton and England midfielder Ross Barkley is another 'homegrown' player to have caught their eye. The City manager is not in action until Monday when he takes his team to Crystal Palace and with Chelsea in an apparently commanding lead at the top, Pellegrini admits his side faces eight cup finals. He said: 'I hope we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end. We will see the way we play. I hope the way we finish against West Brom is the way we must continue. 'It is not easy to make a clear analysis because they play with one player less. I hope in these eight games we continue playing that way.'\n","right_summary":"Manuel Pellegrini said Man City's Academy players aren't up to standard.

{"document":"A humble wooden deckchair recovered from the doomed Titanic has sold for \u00a3100,350 at auction. The Nantucket wooden chair, which once sat on a first-class promenade of the ill-fated ship, was salvaged by a search team from the Atlantic Ocean after the Titanic sank in 1912. Dubbed 'one of the rarest types of Titanic collectable', the chair is too fragile to sit on, but has been carefully preserved, having been owned by a British collector for the past 15 years. A 103-year-old deckchair recovered from the wreck of the Titanic is expected sold for \u00a3100,000 at auction. The ship's log records six or seven deckchairs being picked up and taken back to port in Halifax, Nova Scotia. One was given by a crew member to Captain Julien Lemarteleur, who had previously worked on board the Mackay-Bennett. The anonymous seller kept it by a large window overlooking the sea at his home on the south coast, never sat on it due to its fragile state and instead used it as a display item. It was sold yesterday at Henry Aldridge and Son auction house in Devizes, Wiltshire, to a UK buyer. Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son, described the piece as one of 'the most important [bits] of Titanic memorabilia around'. He said: 'It is incredibly rare to find something of that size that was on Titanic, was salvaged and that still exists today. Six or seven recovered deckchairs were stacked on the deck of the Mackay-Bennett as it arrived in Nova Scotia. Titanic (above) sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14. It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the Titanic. He said that he was 'very, very pleased' with the price. The chair is made of teak wood and has an adjustable footrest at the front. It is 57 inches long, 23 inches wide and 35 inches tall. It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the Titanic. Upon his death in 1973, Capt Lemarteleur gave the chair to colleague Captain Robin Lee. The current owner acquired it in 2001. Sold with the chair was an in depth 'provenance package' that authenticates history and association with Titanic. Captain Julien Lemarteleur (above), who collected the chair from the Mackay-Bennett more than 100 years ago. It includes a signed affidavit from Margarete Pennington, who was Mr Lemarteleur's housekeeper in the 1960s. In it she states: 'I personally saw the deckchair that Captain Lemarteleur told me about on many occasions. He said that various pieces of debris taken from the ocean including this Titanic deckchair he acquired. 'I recognise the chair as the same chair I saw in the captain's garage and of which the captain identified as coming from the Titanic.' Craig Sopin, 57, a lawyer from Philadelphia, owns one of the world's largest collections of Titanic memorabilia. He also authenticated the chair and said: 'It isn't often that one has the opportunity to acquire such an important part of Titanic's story. 'For such a significant item to have such a meticulous chain of custody is nothing short of astonishing. Its history can be traced from the auction house back to Titanic itself.' Titanic sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14. A ship, the Carpathia, picked up more than 700 survivors in lifeboats hours later and took them back to New York.

{"document":"A woman who works as a professional \u2018humiliatrix\u2019 has revealed how she earns more than one dollar per minute indulging the subservient fantasies of men around the world. Ceara Lynch, from Portland, Oregon, takes the more traditional dominatrix idea a step further, not just dominating her customers but demeaning, shaming and generally humiliating them. And the 28-year-old entrepreneur says that making money this way\u00a0\u2014 which she has been doing since she was 17\u00a0\u2014 has been a dream. Risqu\u00e9 business: Ceara Lynch, 28, says her career began when she realized how much money she could make from selling her used underwear online; her first pair sold for $70. In a recent interview with Salon, Ceara explains that she got started in the industry by accident. When she was 17, Ceara was on a dating website when one particular suitor intrigued her; the meaner she was to him, the more interested in her he became. She went on to seek out similar men, eventually finding a website called Ebanned where she could sell her used underwear. Her first pair sold for $70. A tame entrance into the world of humiliating men for money soon escalated to selling more personal items online, taking provocative phone calls, and performing live webcam shows. Taking control:\u00a0'Guys really like the idea of me ruining them in this way,' Ceara says. Real-life dating: Ceara says she's up-front about her job when she's dating, and she's had three serious relationships over the course of her career. 'I make most of my money from videos,' she says, adding that custom videos cost $1 per minute and subscribers pay a monthly fee of $39.99 for access to her site. 'They are [point of view]-style videos, which means it\u2019s just me and the camera, and I am looking at the camera and talking to the camera so that the viewer feels like I\u2019m talking to them.' 'I just tap into various fetishes and they\u2019re all just under the umbrella of [female dominance]. I always play a dominant role, and I tap into things like cuckolding, small penis humiliation, foot fetish, toilet slavery, giantess \u2014 which is this fetish where guys imagine this giant woman that\u2019s going to come and crush them with her feet or swallow them whole \u2014 different stuff like that.' Besides paying for subscriptions and purchasing the personal items that Ceara sells online, customers can also mail Ceara cash, buy her gift cards to Amazon, Southwest Airlines, or a massage parlor, or purchase items off her Amazon wishlist, which includes a $399.99 GoPro,\u00a0$1,295 Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, and a $23 Pikachu adult cosplay costume. No secret: Friends and family know what Ceara does for a living, and her dad thought she was a 'genius' when he learned how she was making money. While such interests might scare off some people, Ceara likes the fact that she is privy to intimate knowledge that her customers don't necessarily reveal in their personal lives. 'I think it\u2019s fascinating and I think it\u2019s also flattering, in a way, that guys are telling me things that they don\u2019t tell anyone else,' she says. Ceara also isn't quite as excited about humiliating her customers as they are about being humiliated, which she says makes it easy for her to compartmentalize and separate her job from her personal life.

{"document":"Jakarta (CNN)An Indonesian court has rejected a bid by two Australian drug smugglers -- members of the \"Bali Nine\" -- to challenge their planned executions. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are awaiting death by firing squad on Indonesia's \"execution island\" for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot. A panel of three judges in the state administrative court in Jakarta on Monday confirmed an earlier ruling that it lacked the jurisdiction to hear challenges against President Joko Widodo's refusal to grant clemency. Lawyers for the pair had argued that Widodo had failed to individually consider their cases. One of the condemned men's lawyers, Leonard Aritonang, said he was disappointed with the rulings but would respect the court's decision. He said his team would file a further review, asking the Constitutional Court to explain Widodo's obligations regarding granting clemency. \"I'm hoping the government still respects... any ongoing proceedings,\" he said. Tony Spontana, a spokesman for the Indonesian attorney general's office, told CNN that the state administrative court's ruling was \"a relief.\" \"We had predicted it will be rejected because clemency is a prerogative right of the President, as head of the government, not an object of a suit at the administrative court,\" he said in a message. \"With this decision, it's a step closer towards the scheduled execution.\" Australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair and has unsuccessfully proposed a prisoner swap with Indonesia as a way of avoiding their deaths. Indonesia has long taken a hard line on drug smugglers, and since assuming office in October, Widodo has made it clear he intends to be tough on those found guilty of such crimes. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour in January, he said there would be \"no compromise\" on drug dealers. \"Indonesia is in a drug emergency, so we need to have something that's firm,\" said Widodo. \"They can ask for amnesty from the President. ... But I'm telling you there will be no amnesty for drug dealers.\" In December, six prisoners convicted of drug offenses were killed by firing squad, including five foreigners from Brazil, the Netherlands, Malawi, Nigeria and Vietnam. Chan and Sukumaran have been jailed since April 2005 for a failed bid to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin from Bali to Australia. The Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Chan, 31, was called the ringleader of the plot, while Sukumaran was described as Chan's collaborator. Seven other people who participated in the plan are serving lengthy prison sentences. Police caught four people at the Denpasar airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies. Another four -- including Sukumaran -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta. Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney; he wasn't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot. Opinion: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war. Sukumaran and Chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars, according to fellow inmates and the jail's chief warden. Sukumaran is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates. Chan has found spirituality, which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has said that their rehabilitation is genuine.

{"document":"A benefits cheat who claimed he could barely walk while starring for his pub football team has avoided jail. Raymond Billam illegally pocketed \u00a315,000 of taxpayers' money after he said he was severely disabled due to back and knee problems. But fraud investigators secretly filmed the 40-year-old midfielder taking to the pitch for a Sunday League team after being tipped-off about his fraudulent claims. The grandfather-of-four admitted benefit fraud and was sentenced to 26-weeks in prison suspended for two years. Cheat: Raymond Billam, 40, claimed he was unable to walk more than a few metres, but was filmed running and jumping as he took to the pitch for his pub football team. Shaven headed Billam claimed he was unable to walk more than 20 metres without falling and needed crutches to get around. But between September 2008 and April 2014 he pulled on the green and black shirt of Ingsfield Lane football club and two other teams in the Mexborough and District Sunday League. In total Billam of Bolton-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, played over 87 games while dishonestly claiming incapacity benefit, Barnsley Magistrates Court was told. Julie Grant, prosecuting, said: 'Over three consecutive Sundays he was playing football, running, jumping and participating fully showing no signs of discomfort.' His appearances and goals were even posted on the internet, magistrates' heard. 'Clearly this is not consistent with somebody unable to walk without aids,' the prosecutor added. When Billam was arrested he said he had 'good days and bad days' and he was so well-known in the league that others could have been playing under his name. But he could not provide investigators with a list of names. Billam admitted defrauding the Department of Work and Pensions by pocketing \u00a315,066 through dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances which affected his disability living allowance. Chris Peace, defending, said Billam, who has four grandchildren, had worked as a contractor for Yorkshire Water for 16 years until he suffered a serious back injury in 2006 which needed surgery. He initially  made a legitimate claim and went from 13 to 18 and a half stones and had problems with drinking and gambling. 'He was in a bit of a state,' said Mr Peace. The court heard that playing football helped Billam recover from the\u00a0the low point in his life. Billam had claimed more than \u00a315,000 in incapacity benefit when the Department of Work and Pensions were tipped off. Unknown to the grandfather-of-four he was secretly filmed by fraud investigators donning his green and black shirt. Billam was sentenced to a 26-week suspended prison sentence after he admitted benefit fraud. Billam, who was taking jobs as a self employed plumber by October 2013, accepted that he should have notified the Department of Work and Pensions earlier that he was fit to work. 'The allowance was a regular source of income and he had three children at home and it was very difficult to do without that,' his lawyer said. 'It was difficult to wave goodbye to that when you have lots of bills.' The court heard Billam was repaying the money and the whole amount outstanding would be paid off. Billam was given a 26-week jail term suspended for two years, ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and he will be subject to an electronically monitored daily curfew for four months. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: 'Billam was very brazen about what he was doing. 'It's hard to believe someone can think they are entitled to incapacity benefits because they claim they can't walk far without assistance. 'Yet we observed him on three consecutive Sundays, running around, jumping and heading the ball and putting in some strong tackles.'\n","right_summary":"Raymond Billam defrauded the Department of Work and Pensions. 40-year-old claimed he had severe problems with his knees and back.

{"document":"Sevilla coach Unai Emery is one of the more eccentric characters in La Liga but the Andalusian club's success this season suggests there is plenty of method in the Basque-born 43-year-old's apparent madness. Prowling the touchline during games, Emery's frantic arm gestures, wild eyes and bellowed commands clearly inspire his players rather than distract them. Sevilla are fifth in La Liga ahead of the visit of leaders Barcelona on Saturday. Sevilla coach Unai Emery has guided the club to fifth in the La Liga table ahead of the visit of Barcelona. Emery is one of the most animated coaches in La Liga and is often seen gesturing on the touchline. 'Since he arrived there has been a clear upwards trend,' midfielder Vicente Iborra said of Emery, who joined Sevilla in January 2013, on the club's radio station on Wednesday. 'Those who know him know that he lives for football and for his club, with all the responsibility that brings. 'And the important thing is that it rubs off on us. Having a coach and training staff like that is to be valued, it's not easy and we have to, and will, make the most of it.' Jose Antonio Reyes (centre) is congratulated after scoring the winner in Monday's victory over Levante. Emery roars with delight as his Sevilla side claimed a 2-1 victory at the Ciutat de Valencia Stadium. After a run of five straight victories they are well placed to secure at least a berth in the Europa League, the competition they won last season and are still alive in this term. They may even pip Atletico Madrid and Valencia to a Champions League berth. Barca lead on 74 points with eight games left, with Real Madrid, who play at Eibar on Saturday, second on 70 and Atletico, who are away at Malaga, third on 65. Valencia and Sevilla each have 61 points in fourth and fifth, although Valencia have played one game fewer and have an away match at Athletic Bilbao later on Thursday before hosting city rivals Levante on Monday. Emery took over at Sevilla in  2013 and has overseen a 'clear upwards trend', according to Vicente Iborra.

Police in Rhein Erft, received a bizarre phone call explaining that a large kangaroo was spotted 'happily' hopping through a field.

{"document":"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's wine from their French vineyard has gone on sale in a British supermarket for the first time after winning rave reviews from critics. Marks and Spencer is stocking a limited supply of the 2014 Miraval Rose and has urged those seeking a taste of the superstars' Provence vineyard to 'get in quick'. The \u00a318-a-bottle wine is produced at the couple's Chateau Miraval estate, where they married in August last year after having purchased it for \u00a341million in 2012. Brad and Angelina's 2014 Miraval Rose wine (pictured) right has finally reached the High street after receiving rave reviews from wine critics. The wine is produced at the couple's Chateau Miraval estate (pictured), where they married in August last year. Wine Spectator ranked the first vintage at number 84 in its list of the top 100 wines of 2013, making it the only rose to be included, while Decanter magazine described it as having 'a sense of power alongside the elegance ... with a delicious mouth-watering finish'. The wine has sold previously in the UK through specialist wine merchants but M&S is the first to offer it up on the High street. The retailer describes it as an 'intriguing pale pink rose with strawberry, white pear and floral aromas' with summer berry, wild herb and tangy tangerine flavours balanced by a refreshing acidity.' Helping Pitt and Jolie take over the vineyard was Marc Perrin, a famous Provence winemaker who was introduced to the Hollywood stars by friends last year. According to Perrin, his family and the famous couple came together with the business venture over a few bottles of wine when the stars invited him over to the Chateau in June 2012. M&S drinks buyer Emma Dawson said: 'We're excited to be launching what could well be the most famous rose in the world. 'Not only does Miraval boast A-lister owners, it's a really lovely crisp rose, perfect for summer drinking.' She added: 'This rose is best enjoyed lightly chilled, while young and fresh, and makes an excellent aperitif or matches with many Provencal style dishes such as fish, vegetables and salads.' The 2014 Miraval Rose is available in selected M&S stores now. Helping Pitt and Jolie take over the vineyard (pictured) was Marc Perrin, a famous Provence winemaker.

{"document":"Court battle: Lord Janner's alleged victims could sue him for \u00a32.5million after the CPS dropped a prosecution against him for the fourth time. Lord Janner's alleged victims could sue him for \u00a32.5million after being denied justice for the fourth time in 25 years when the CPS refused to prosecute him. Police have identified 25 people who claim the Labour peer attacked them and each could claim for up to \u00a3100,000. One man, allegedly attacked by Janner when he was living in a  children's homes between 1981 and 1988, has already instructed lawyers to sue him and Leicestershire County Council for damages. His solicitor Peter Garsden, president of the Association of Child Abuse Lawyers, has said that after a string of bungled investigations suing 'may be the only way the alleged victims are going to get some sort of justice'. Several of those who claim to have been sexually abused say Janner got to them through paedophile Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children's homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. The CPS last week said the 'core allegation' was that Lord Janner befriended Beck to access children 'to allow him to perpetrate serious sexual offences' on them. Beck died in jail in 1994. Mr Garsden said: 'We are preparing a claim for this man against Lord Janner and Leicestershire County Council. 'The allegations involved the most extreme abuse. Our case is that Frank Beck was running the home where this man was introduced to Greville Janner. 'Perhaps this is the only way the alleged victims in this case are going to get some sort of justice.' A compensation scheme for Jimmy Savile's dozens of victims was agreed at the High Court last year where those abused were paid out of his \u00a33.3million estate. Last seen: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July\u00a08 2014, when he was last seen in public. Test cases: Victims abused by Jimmy Savile and Liberal MP Cyril Smith also sued after they were denied justice. Liz Dux, whose law firm Slater & Gordon respresents 168 of Jimmy Savile's victims and 10 of former Liberal MP for Rochdale Cyril Smith, says that Janner's alleged victims could be handed \u00a3100,000 each. Campaigners, police chiefs and MPs have accused Alison Saunders, the director of the CPS (above), of ignoring the rights of victims. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, who made the decision not to prosecute Lord Janner, claimed \u00a313,400 in expenses last year including almost \u00a37,000 on business-class flights. Her most recently published expenses show she flew business class to Washington, Dubai and New York in the year that the CPS was forced to cut its budget by 27 per cent. Mrs Saunders, pictured, has been heavily criticised in recent weeks over corruption charges against journalists and deciding not to prosecute Lord Janner over alleged sex offences. The publicly funded trips included one to the Caribbean for an \u2018official meeting\u2019 last September which cost the taxpayer \u00a33,105 for hotels and flights. A CPS spokesman said: \u2018The DPP\u2019s travel overseas helps the CPS to join forces with other countries so we can reduce serious crime both in the UK and around the world.\u2019 The CPS said the DPP travels standard fares unless there is a long-haul trip and a requirement to work immediately at the other end. Mrs Saunders, who earns \u00a3200,000 a year, charged the taxpayer \u00a3102 for one taxi journey. The CPS said they have strict rules on when taxis should be used, including when heavy baggage has to be carried or when there are no other suitable methods of transportation. She said: 'If the victims of Lord Janner are successful, damages could be sizeable. 'Civil redress is the next logical step after the CPS decision.' Lord Janner's family has said he is 'entirely innocent of any wrongdoing' and 'is a man of great integrity'. A Leicestershire County Council spokesman said: 'We have been co-operating with the police on aspects of their investigation that relate to historic abuse involving the former county council children's homes in the 1970s and 1980s. 'Since then, the council has introduced a series of safeguards and procedures to minimise the chances of this kind of abuse from happening again. All relevant documents have been provided to the police. 'We have not been approached so far regarding compensation claims and so cannot comment further at this time.' The CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. However, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. She spoke of her 'deep regret' as she announced that Lord Janner will not face trial and admitted he should have been charged three times before in 1991, 2002 and 2007 but was left off the hook. Last night it emerged that Lord Janner signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges. Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. Leicestershire Police, who disagree with the decision not to charge Janner having investigated him for the past two years, have admitted they may contact the House of Lords about the letter. MailOnline revealed yesterday that\u00a0at least 19 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010, including ten in the past year.

{"document":"Labour leader Harold Wilson secretly lobbied the BBC to change the time of popular comedy Steptoe and Son on the night of the 1964 election because he feared working class voters would stay at home and watch the show instead of supporting his candidates. According to new archive footage held by the BBC, Mr Wilson went to the home of BBC Director General Sir Hugh Greene and told him the show could cost him 20 seats. Mr Wilson was leader of the opposition and was seeking to oust the Conservative Prime Minister Alec Douglas Home. The Labour leader thought the planned repeat of the sit-com starring Harry H Corbett and Wilfrid Brambell would hit them badly. Scroll down for video. The Labour Party was afraid that its supporters would stay at home and watch a repeat of Steptoe and Son featuring Harry H Corbett, left, and Wilfrid Brambell, right, instead of coming out to vote in 1964. Labour leader Harold Wilson, centre, approached the BBC directly to delay the show's repeat broadcast. So he approached Sir Hugh at his home to express his concerns over the broadcast. The BBC is releasing an archive interview with Sir Hugh recorded in 1982 as well as a 1981 interview with the former Prime Minister. The joint project between the BBC and the University of Sussex, which is being published today, shows the corporation's involvement in elections since 1922. According to Sir Hugh's 1982 interview: 'He came around to have a drink. He had been very much upset because the BBC had planned the beginning of a series of repeats of a very popular light entertainment programme, Steptoe and Son, on the evening of polling day. He thought that would keep away particularly Labour supporters from the polls.' At the peak of the show's popularity, some 28 million people tuned in. Sir Hugh continued: 'Harold Wilson that evening began by accusing the BBC of plotting against him. I told him that he must really know in his heart of hearts that that was untrue, and unless he withdrew that remark there was no point in our discussing anything. We could just have a drink and that could be that. 'He did withdraw and we talked about the Steptoe and Son problem. The next day I discussed the matter further with the controller of BBC One and we thought a good idea would be to shift it from early in the evening until nine o'clock, when at that time the polls closed. 'I rang up Harold Wilson and told him about this decision and he said to me he was very grateful - it might make a difference of about 20 seats to him. 'He won, I think, by four, and I've sometimes wondered what effect my decision had on British political history.' Former BBC Director General Sir Hugh Greene, pictured, said Mr Wilson feared broadcasting Steptoe and Son on the 1964 election night could end up costing the Labour Party 20 seats - they won the election by four. Mr Wilson also gave an interview on the subject which has been published as part of the archive. He said: 'Polling then ended at nine o'clock and a lot of our people - my people, working in Liverpool, long journey out, perhaps then a high tea and so on, it was getting late, especially if they wanted to have a pint first. 'I said I didn't want a popular programme between eight to nine o'clock. It was the equivalent of bringing Morecambe and Wise back. Hugh didn't think much of this argument. He said: \"What would you prefer to put on between eight o'clock and nine o'clock?\" 'I said: \"Greek drama, preferably in the original.\"'\n","right_summary":"Harold Wilson feared the popular sit-com would cost him 20 seats in 1964.

{"document":"It looks, and sometimes acts, like a huge sponge floating in space. But this crumpet-like rock is in fact one of Saturn's outer moons, measuring 255 by 161 miles (410 by 260km). Named Hyperion, the moon's porous surface can be seen in incredible detail in this image taken by Cassini as it performed a flyby of the satellite. The floating bath sponge: This image shows one of Saturn's outer moons, measuring 255 by 161 miles (410 by 260km).\u00a0Cassini was around 38,500 miles (62,000 km) from Hyperion when the image was taken. Hyperion is shaped like a potato and is one of the largest bodies in the solar system known to be so irregular. Its odd, almost 'bubbly' appearance, can be attributed to it having a very low density for its size, according to Nasa.\u00a0This low density also means that it is composed largely of water ice with only a small amount of rock. Because of these properties the entire moon is porous, like a sponge, with well-preserved craters of various sizes packed together across its surface.\u00a0Scientists believe around 40 per cent of the moon is empty space. Cassini was around 38,500 miles (62,000 km) from Hyperion when the image was taken almost a decade ago. Esa has just released a refined, false-colour perspective of the moon in which its surface features were highlighted by toning down its natural redness. During the flyby, the probe got more than it bargained for as Hyperion unleashed a burst of charged particles towards the spacecraft, effectively delivering a giant 200-volt electric shock. It appears that Hyperion's surface becomes electrostatically charged as it is bathed in charged particles. These particles are constantly streaming out into space from the sun, but Hyperion also has to deal with ones trapped within the magnetic field of its host planet, Saturn. While astronomers expected many bodies throughout the solar system to be charged, the Cassini data represents the first-ever experience of a charged natural object in space other than our moon. 'This is comparable to what happens when you rub your hair against a balloon, or when a shirt or blouse rubs against a sweater,' said Professor Tom Nordheim at University College London. Hyperion is shaped like a potato and is one of the largest bodies in the solar system known to be so irregular. Its odd, almost 'bubbly' appearance, can be attributed to it having a very low density for its size.

{"document":"A writer has revealed why she stopped washing her hair six years ago after embarking on a quest to try and control her greasy, limp locks - by avoiding shampoo. New Yorker Sarah Theeboom was inspired to give up using products on her hair after she ran into an old friend whose once dry, frizzy locks were smooth and shiny. When Sarah asked for her secret, her friend explained that she had simply stopped shampooing, opting to partake in the apparently-popular 'no poo' movement, which Sarah had never heard of until that moment. 'I wasn\u2019t in love with it, and I just didn\u2019t really know what to do,' she told Seventeen. 'I wanted to try my friend\u2019s trick and stop shampooing.' Scroll down for video. Natural beauty: Sarah Theeboom (pictured) hasn't washed her hair in six years after a friend told her that giving up shampoo was the secret to gorgeous locks. Although her friend warned her that her scalp and hair would go through a nasty adjustment period, Sarah wasn't prepared for the dandruff and excessive amounts of grease that she first experienced after she first started shunning shampoo during a three-week vacation to Thailand. Sarah recalled that during those first few weeks her hair was the 'greasiest' it had ever been. 'I was so embarrassed that I didn\u2019t want to show my head to anyone,' she explained. Despite the fact that she 'almost cracked' and went back to shampoo, she forged on with her mission. After vacation she started wrapping her hair with headbands every day. When she showered she would wet her hair and scrub her scalp with her fingers. And even though her boyfriend was critical of the idea, Sarah explained that, by this point, she 'felt committed' to her cause. New woman: The writer from New York City said her hair is now silkier and 'totally frizz-free' since she gave up using shampoo. It took six weeks for her hair to feel somewhat normal again and then another six weeks of her hair looking 'so-so' before the 'magic happened'. 'I started to see what my natural hair was like when I wasn\u2019t constantly doing stuff to manipulate it,' Sarah explained. 'It was silky and wavier and totally frizz-free.' The 'no poo' movement has gained popularity over recent years because of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Shailene Woodley, Adele and Jessica Simpson who have revealed that that they avoid washing their hair for days - and sometimes months - on end. Because it is no longer considered a ludicrous concept, Sarah said that she typically doesn't have a problem sharing her hair secret, but she did note that sometimes she will come across someone who just doesn't get it - including one hair stylist who didn't understand why she couldn't shampoo her hair. Sarah explained that her although her current regimen sounds like a 'beauty philosophy', she was really just experimenting to see what worked for her. 'I don\u2019t think shampoo is evil or bad for your hair...' she said. 'I still have good hair days and bad hair days, but overall, my hair looks and feels so much healthier.'\n","right_summary":"Sarah Theeboom, from New York City, gave up using hair products as a part of the 'no poo' movement.

Ten-year-old Martha had been with her owner on the beach in Leasowe in Merseyside and was paddling in the water when she was caught out by a strong current.

Khan hasn't fought since his win over Devon Alexander in December and has struggled to find an opponent. Broner has been relentless in his calling out of Khan since his comfortable win over John Molina Jr. But in the shorter term, the Bolton fighter has held talks with American Broner, who tweeted a video of himself and Khan talking via video.

{"document":"Fans of the late actor Paul Walker knew that watching him in \"Furious 7\" would be bittersweet. Even so, many moviegoers said the final scenes of the new film, which earned a record $146 million over the weekend, still packed an emotional wallop. \"Not gonna lie, I shed a few tears at the end of Furious 7. The tribute to Paul Walker was very well done,\" one woman said Monday on Twitter. Hers was just one of a flood of messages on social media from people who said they got choked up during scenes featuring Walker, who died at 40 in a car crash in November 2013, before filming on \"Furious 7\" was completed. To finish Walker's scenes, the makers of the movie used body doubles, computer-generated images and even the actor's brothers. But it was the ending that really got to moviegoers. In finishing \"Furious 7,\" the film's producers sought to retire Walker's character, Brian, while paying homage to his role in the blockbuster \"Furious\" action franchise. But they felt that killing him off might appear exploitative. \"If they had gone down the other path, I think I would have refused to finish making this movie,\" director James Wan told BuzzFeed. Instead, the movie's makers chose to \"retire Paul's character in the most sincere and elegant way (they) could,\" Wan said. Their idea was to have Brian retire from his dangerous, high-octane lifestyle out of a sense of responsibility to his growing family with girlfriend Mia, who is pregnant with their second child. A scene late in the movie shows him and Mia playing on a beach with their son while the crew looks on -- essentially saying goodbye. Then his longtime buddy Dom reminisces about their years together, leading to a montage of Walker scenes from the first six movies. The song that plays over the montage is  \"See You Again,\" a collaboration between Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth. Co-star Vin Diesel shared the video for the song late Sunday on his Facebook page, where it has more than 1.5 million likes. Fans on Twitter and Facebook mostly praised the movie's ending as a fitting tribute -- and an emotionally wrenching one. \"Man I don't care how tough u are or how gangsta u claim to be . ...the last five minutes had me choked up in the movie theater ... I saw it 3 times in one day ... ...the ending is the deepest ending I've ever seen,\" one man wrote on the movie's Facebook page.\n","right_summary":"Moviegoers are tearing up during the emotional ending of \"Furious 7\" The movie's end is a tribute of sorts to actor Paul Walker, who died during filming.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Paul Walker, the star of the \"Furious\" action franchise, returned from the dead in the latest installment, \"Furious 7,\" thanks to some clever CGI and other technological advances.

Reds captain Gerrard is set to feature for Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley on Sunday, looking to lead his hometown side into the final against Arsenal. Should Liverpool emerge victorious against Villa, Gerrard will sign off his Anfield career in the final which takes place on his birthday of May 30, before moving to LA Galaxy.

Gerrard is aiming to end his Liverpool career by making the FA Cup final and beating Arsenal. Skrtel (right) has praised the impact and example Gerrard has set during his time at Liverpool.

Skrtel was signed by Rafael Benitez from Zenit St Petersburg seven years ago and despite some indifferent form upon arriving in England, the Slovakia international has gone on to become a mainstay in Liverpool's defence. Skrtel revealed that Gerrard helped him to settle at the beginning of his time at the club. 'I can say only good things about him,' Skrtel said.

{"document":"Ed Miliband has been getting a lot of praise for admitting that he \u2018blubbed\u2019 while watching Pride, a British film released last year. It\u2019s a rose-tinted, nostalgic look back at a critical moment in 20th-century British history. Every drop of sentiment is wrung out of the story, with brave young men and women risking their lives to take on an evil dictator. So what is it about, this heartwarming tale of British derring-do? The Battle of Britain? The Falklands crisis? The Iraq War? Scroll down for video. Labour leader Ed Miliband confessed that he 'blubbed' during the British film Pride that centres on the 1984 miners' strike. No. It centres on the 1984 miners\u2019 strike and the plucky underdogs are a London-based group of gays and lesbians who travel to South Wales to express their solidarity with the local branch of the National Union of Mineworkers. Needless to say, the evil dictator who they\u2019re fighting is Margaret Thatcher. Miliband received a lot of praise for admitting that he had a weep. What a surprise that such a storyline led the Labour leader to exclaim: \u2018Justine [his wife] and I watched it recently and blubbed.\u2019 I\u2019m sure Pride isn\u2019t the only British film that the right-on Milibands will have cried their way through. For there have been so many over recent years that mythologised the \u2018brave and downtrodden\u2019 workers whose lives are made miserable by the Tories. In truth, these movies \u2014 Pride, Billy Elliot (also a piece of miners\u2019 strike propaganda that depicted Thatcher as the Devil incarnate), Made In Dagenham (about a car factory strike) and The Full Monty (about a group of redundant Sheffield steelworkers forced to strip naked to make money) \u2014might as well have been party political broadcasts for Labour. For the keystone of these Left-wing propaganda films is a pernicious rewriting of history, portraying Britain\u2019s recent past as a battle between heroic trade unionists, fighting to defend the poor and the vulnerable, and unfeeling bosses, bulldozing everything in their path in the ruthless pursuit of making money for their capitalist overlords. There is no acknowledgment by the film-makers that the unions\u2019 greed and bully-boy tactics all but destroyed the British economy, or that their beloved welfare state (which has actually created a terrible dependency culture in many parts of the country) relies on a strong, unsabotaged economy to keep it afloat. The film Pride achieves a double whammy by venerating not one but two sacred cows of the Left: bolshie unions and minorities (in this case, homosexuals). Naturally, it doesn\u2019t take long for the union bosses to recognise that the life-and-death struggle faced by gays and lesbians is very similar to that of their Welsh colliery members. Scroll down for video. Wringing every drop of emotion from Left-wing audiences, the director ends the film with a scene showing bus-loads of miners turning up to support a gay pride march in London\u2019s Hyde Park, as singer Billy Bragg\u2019s There Is Power In A Union comes blasting over the soundtrack. Strangely absent from the story, of course, is any reference to the role the NUM played in bringing down successive British governments \u2014 both Conservative and Labour alike \u2014 and its contribution to the terrible industrial unrest that gripped Britain in the Seventies and culminated in the Winter of Discontent. Nor is there any mention of the attempt by Arthur Scargill, the loony-Left leader of the NUM, to persuade communist Russia \u2014 not to mention Colonel Gaddafi \u2014 to bankroll the strike, which his members hadn\u2019t even had the right to vote for in a fair ballot. Billy Elliott is another film about \u2018brave and downtrodden\u2019 workers whose lives are made miserable by the Tories. The same historical revisionism is exhibited in Made In Dagenham, about women workers walking out on strike at the Ford car factory in East London in 1968, demanding equal pay with male employees. As with Pride, the dramatic heart of the story is a conflict between two groups of Left-wing activists who gradually learn to make common cause \u2014 in this case, male and female shop-floor workers. At no point in the film is any sympathy shown towards the employers struggling to keep the firm competitive. The viewer is expected to assume that the demands of the strikers are completely justified. Made In Dagenham\u2019s political message couldn\u2019t be clearer, and it ends on a triumphant note with the passing of the Equal Pay Act by a Labour government in 1970. A more honest assessment of the British car industry would have featured the way union firebrands such as Derek Robinson \u2014 \u2018Red Robbo\u2019 \u2014 at British Leyland helped to destroy it and did so much damage to the economy at large. Indeed, a more realistic ending to Made In Dagenham would have pointed out that the Ford factory which once employed 40,000 people now has fewer than 4,000, thanks, in part, to rising labour costs \u2014 pushed up by militant unions. Brassed off starring Pete Postlethwaite and Ewan McGregor portrayed Margaret Thatcher as an orge. Then again, that would have meant acknowledging the inconvenient truth that the trade unions played a big role in the postwar decline of Britain\u2019s industrial base. Perhaps the most glaring omission from such Left-wing propaganda movies is any concession that the policies of Margaret Thatcher were a necessary corrective to the chaos and pessimism of the Seventies. The fact is that her government inherited a country on the brink of political and economic collapse and restored it to rude good health, able to hold its head up high again in the world. But in so many Left-inspired British films of the past 25 years, whether Brassed Off (about a colliery band facing the closure of their coalmine by a Tory government), The Full Monty or Billy Elliot, Thatcher is portrayed as a wrecking ball determined to destroy traditional working-class communities and replace nice Left-wing values with nasty Right-wing ones. Inevitably, the period before Thatcher is depicted as a golden age, a pastoral idyll straight out of a Hovis commercial, while the Britain she left behind is portrayed as a money-grubbing spiritual wasteland. Is it any wonder that such films make Ed Miliband, brought up by a Marxist academic father, \u2018blub\u2019? The only exception to this disgraceful series of truth-twisting films was The Iron Lady, in which Britain\u2019s first female Prime Minister was shown in a more nuanced light, almost in spite of its makers\u2019 Left-wing instincts. Made In Dagenham is about women workers walking out on strike at the Ford car factory in East London in 1968, demanding equal pay with male employees. It is broadly unsympathetic \u2014 there are plenty of scenes in which she is seen to be suffering from dementia, which suggests an element of hostility \u2014 but actress Meryl Streep brings such depth and humanity to the lead role that Baroness Thatcher emerges as a more complex figure than the bogeyman of Left-wing mythology. Not surprisingly, The Iron Lady was condemned by many in the British film establishment for being \u2018shallow\u2019 and \u2018superficial\u2019, an example of \u2018self-important\u2019 film-making. No doubt if it had depicted Thatcher as a cruel monster, the same critics would have acclaimed it an out-and-out masterpiece. But not to worry. This mistake was corrected the following year by Labour-supporting Danny Boyle. In his lavish \u00a327 million opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympics he made no direct reference to Britain\u2019s greatest postwar Prime Minister \u2014 which was odd in itself \u2014 but left viewers in no doubt about his view of Thatcherism. Once again we were treated to the familiar Left-wing version of Britain\u2019s history, in which top-hatted Tory industrialists, determined to despoil the country with dark satanic mills, are stopped in their tracks by an alliance of suffragettes, trade unionists and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender activists. Boyle\u2019s collaborator, Frank Cottrell Boyce, condemned Thatcher for being \u2018insufficiently British\u2019 and said \u2018although she draped herself in the Union Flag, she never seemed to understand this country\u2019. The Iron Lady was condemned by many in the British film establishment for being \u2018shallow\u2019 and \u2018superficial\u2019, an example of \u2018self-important\u2019 film-making. The truth is, it\u2019s the Left that doesn\u2019t understand contemporary Britain. We are not a drab, depressed country, riven with class divisions and grotesque inequality, as you would think from watching films such as Pride and Billy Elliot. On the contrary, crime is lower, life expectancy higher and the standard of living better than at any time in our past. The rights of women, gays and ethnic minorities are all robustly defended by politicians of both Left and Right, and our schools and hospitals have never been better (or more lavishly funded). Britain now has the fastest-growing economy in the Western world, with more jobs being created last year in Yorkshire \u2014 ironically, the county where so many of these Left-wing propaganda films have been set \u2014 than in the whole of France. Couldn\u2019t we have just one home-grown film that celebrates the miracle that is modern Britain and brings a tear of pride to us all, rather than Left-wing drivel that triggers \u2018blubbing\u2019 from Ed Miliband?\n","right_summary":"Ed Miliband has admitted that he cried watching the British film Pride.

After their first meeting she said: \u2018I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me. 'For the duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn\u2019t get over her face. \u2018And some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, \u201cOh my God that\u2019s my face\u201d. I can\u2019t remember the number of times I said \u201cthis is so freaky\u201d. It was truly amazing. \u2018I would say Karen is the shyer of the two of us,\u2019 said Miss Geaney. \u2018But then you have to remember this was an even more surreal experience for her than it was for me. I\u2019m the weirdo that contacted Karen and asked her to meet me.\u2019 Uncanny:\u00a0Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old student from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' in Karen Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends. 'For the entire duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn\u2019t get over her face,' said Niamh (left) Miss Branigan, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Miss Greaney has two sisters, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Since meeting, Miss Greaney and Miss Branigan - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly'. Karen (right) turned out to be a fellow Ireland native who lived just an hour down the road from Niamh (left), making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together. She added, 'Some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, \"Oh my God that\u2019s my face\"' While Miss Geaney appears to have beaten her fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry and 22-year-old Terence, hands down, the search isn't over until April 27. 'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry English said. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence Manzanga. 'Must be a guy thing. They tend to be a bit too shy to participate. Not sure if being originally from sub-Saharan Africa has anything to do with it!' Niamh (right) said she and Karen (left) got on 'very well' as they both applied make-up before the shoot, swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities (pictured) Friends for life? Since meeting, Niamh (right) and Karen (left) - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly' Feedback: Shocked reactions to Karen and Niamh's story have flooded in from far and wide. Challenge: Niamh's (right) fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry (left) and 22-year-old Terence (centre), are still looking for their doppelg\u00e4ngers, and the search isn't over until April 27. Miss Geaney, who is still promoting the project across social media with Harry and Terence as interest spreads, says there will be no prize for the winner, just 'pride'. They are inviting others from around the world to join in too now, by adding users' photos to their Facebook album. 'There is a huge human curiosity element to it,' She said. 'Can you imagine how surreal it would be to meet someone who looked exactly like you?' Only last month the Mail revealed how retired priest Neil Richardson was greeted with waves and \u2018hello John\u2019 greetings when he moved to Braintree, Essex, 18 months ago because residents mistook him for 74-year-old lookalike John Jemison.\n","right_summary":"Niamh Geaney, 26, found her\u00a0doppelg\u00e4nger through social media.

Billy Thompson was last seen on Saturday at Sugar Bear's home in McIntyre, Georgia, where Mama June's daughter Jessica was preparing to go to prom. Since then Billy hasn't been seen and he isn't returning any phone calls or texts. Scroll down for video. Reality star 'Mama' June Shannon and her estranged husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson have filed a missing persons report after his older brother disappeared three days ago. Billy Thompson, center, was last seen on Saturday at Sugar Bear's home in McIntyre, Georgia, where Mama June's daughter Jessica was preparing to go to prom. The family have filed a report with the local police department and are especially worried because Billy has been struggling to find work and recently suffered a difficult split from the mother of his children, reports TMZ. The family's popular reality show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, was cancelled by TLC after photos emerged of Shannon spending time with convicted child molester Mark McDaniel. June's oldest daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, has accused McDaniel of repeatedly abusing her when she was just a child. In the wake of the cancellation, Thompson's younger brother - Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson \u2013 revealed to The National Enquirer  that Shannon had indulged in a 'threesome' with Sugar Bear and older brother Billy back in 2007. 'June said all of the kids were out of the house and Billy came over to visit them,' Uncle Poodle told the Enquirer\u00a0in December. 'Billy happened to see her in her undergarments. He then told June, \"If you are dressed like that when I get back, I'm going to have sex with you.\"' Billy, pictured with June's daughter Jessica on the day of Mama June and Sugar Bear's wedding in May 2013 hasn't been seen since April 11 and isn't returning phone calls or texts. Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson, above, claimed in December that Mama June had enjoyed a 'threesome' with Sugar Bear and his older brother Billy. Poodle then says that when Billy came back June was 'naked in bed and they ended up having a threesome.' When asked about the incident, Billy said he 'couldn't remember.' In the wake of the Enquirer's revelation, Poodle posted a text message exchange he had with June in which she reportedly told him; 'IM GOING TO CONFRONT EVERYONE ON EVERYTHING BCYES YOU HAVE STARTED SOME LIES.' She then reportedly wrote; 'OH AND YEAH YOUR FAKE DATE WITH NATIONAL ENQUIOR WHEN YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT ME BILLY AND SUGAR BEAR IT'S OKAY BC THAT IS MY PAST.' Mama June didn't respond officially to the claims, and Uncle Poodle refused to back down. 'I would be more than happy to take another polygraph test (based) on what June told me,' he said. 'If she denies it.'\n","right_summary":"'Mama' June Shannon and Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson have filed a missing persons report after his older brother disappeared three days ago.

{"document":"A Columbia University student who was accused of rape is suing the New York City school for allowing his accuser to publicly brand him a \"serial rapist\" According to the lawsuit, Paul Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in Emma Sulkowicz's 2013 rape claim, as well as others that came to light after Sulkowicz went public with her allegations in various media interviews. Her case drew national attention after she started carrying a mattress around campus to protest the school's handling of the complaint, saying she hoped to show how \"flawed\" the university disciplinary system is when it comes to sexual misconduct cases. CNN does not usually name individuals in sexual assault cases, but in this instance, both parties have spoken publicly about their experience. They have also both said in separate interviews with The New York Times that Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in a disciplinary hearing. Nungesser, an international student from Germany, filed a federal discrimination lawsuit last week against the school; its president, Lee Bollinger; and the visual arts professor who oversaw Sulkowicz's mattress project, \"Carry That Weight,\" as part of her senior thesis. The lawsuit alleges the defendants violated Nungesser's right to an education free of gender-based discrimination by allowing Sulkowicz to speak out against him after he had been cleared of wrongdoing. During an April 2014 news conference at Columbia University, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand stood alongside Sulkowicz as she called Nungesser a \"serial rapist\" and said she fears for her safety while he's still on campus. The harassment continued, the lawsuit claims, when Columbia visual arts professor Jon Kessler let Sulkowicz \"transform her personal vendetta\" into a \"Columbia-sponsored calumny\" by supporting \"Carry That Weight\" for her senior thesis, allowing her to earn school credit through \"this outrageous display of harassment and defamation.\" Bollinger also commented on the case in a 2014 New York Magazine profile of Sulkowicz, now a senior at Columbia. \"This is a person who is one of my students, and I care about all of my students. And when one of them feels that she has been a victim of mistreatment, I am affected by that. This is all very painful.\" The defendants \"had the power, as well as the legal and contractual obligation\" to protect Nungesser, who is also a senior, the lawsuit claims. \"By refusing to protect Paul Nungesser, Columbia University first became a silent bystander and then turned into an active supporter of a fellow student's harassment campaign by institutionalizing it and heralding it.\" Columbia University declined to comment on the lawsuit. The school also declined to confirm the outcome of Nungesser's disciplinary proceedings. \"As we have said consistently, we do not and have not commented on individual students or disciplinary cases not only because of federal student privacy law, but also because of our ethical responsibility to ensure all current and future students have confidence that the university will never publicly discuss private matters they share when interacting with counselors and support staff, the campus disciplinary process or other resources we provide to them,\" spokesman Robert Hornsby said in statement. Kessler also declined to comment on the lawsuit. The case has produced dueling narratives from both sides in national media outlets. The most recent came from Nungesser in a Daily Beast article titled, \"Columbia Student: I Didn't Rape Her,\" in which he shared a long exchange of Facebook messages to support his claim that their sex was consensual. Some of those exchanges were included in the lawsuit, but Sulkowicz told CNN they were taken out of context in the suit. She also balked at the idea that Nungesser would sue the school or her professor \"for allowing me to make an art piece.\" \"It's ridiculous that he would read it as a 'bullying strategy,' especially given his continued public attempts to smear my reputation, when really it's just an artistic expression of the personal trauma I've experienced at Columbia,\" Sulkowicz wrote in an email. \"If artists are not allowed to make art that reflects on our experiences, then how are we to heal?\" The project essentially consists of Sulkowicz carrying a twin-size mattress wherever she goes on campus, but not off campus. She's allowed to accept help carrying the object but does not allow herself to ask for help.\u200b. Nungesser's complaint seeks damages to be determined at trial for harm to his reputation, loss of educational opportunities and future career prospects. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia and Camille Cava contributed to this report.\n","right_summary":"Paul Nungesser says he was target of gender-based harassment campaign.

{"document":"A 46-year-old man was sentenced to life in prison on Monday after shooting dead a father and son because they were related to a driver who killed his nine-year-old sister in a crash 45 years ago. Alfred Guy Vuozzo swore loudly as\u00a0he was told he would not be eligible for parole for 35 years for murdering Brent McGuigan, 68, and his son, Brendon, 39, on Prince Edward Island last August. As he was escorted from the courtroom, he screamed: 'You've sentenced me to life and I sent them to death', while the judge called the brutal double-murder an act of 'hatred and misdirected vengeance'. Vuozzo was two years old when his older sister, Cathy, was killed in a crash in 1970. Brent's father, Herbert, who was behind the wheel, later received a nine-month sentence for dangerous driving. Scroll down for video. 'Revenge': Alfred Guy Vuozzo, 46, has been sentenced to life in prison after shooting dead Brent McGuigan, 68, and his son, Brendon (both pictured), 39, because they were related to a driver who killed his nine-year-old sister in a crash 45 years ago. The defendant was told that he will not be eligible for parole for 35 years. Crash: Vuozzo was two years old when his older sister, Cathy, was killed in a crash in 1970. Brent's father, Herbert, who was behind the wheel, received a nine-month sentence. Above, a newspaper photo of the crash. After more than 40 years of torment, Vuozzo confronted the driver's son, Brent, and grandson, Brendon, in their home on St Mary's Road, near the town of Montague,\u00a0CTV News reported. He shot them both in 'execution-style' killings to avenge his sister's death - despite neither victim having had anything to do with the crash that had claimed the life of his sibling all those years ago. In February, Vuozzo pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of Brent and the second-degree murder of Brendon. At the time, he told the court that when Cathy was killed, 'Our lives were ruined'. He added he had needed to do something for her. 'Call me a cold-blooded killer, but I'm not,' he said. Before his sentencing on Monday, Vuozzo said Herbert's 'short' sentence 'has haunted me all my life', saying: 'That's all her life was worth. She only had nine years in this world. And nobody cared.' Shooting: After more than 40 years of torment, Vuozzo confronted the driver's son, Brent, and grandson, Brendon, in their home near Montague, Prince Edward Island, and shot them. Above, police at the scene. Emergency vehicle: He killed both in 'execution-style' slayings to avenge his sister's death - despite neither victim having had anything to do with the car crash that claimed the life of his sibling all those years ago. However, Crown lawyer John Diamond told the provincial Supreme Court in Charlottetown that Vuozzo was a 'cold-hearted' murderer who had shot his victims with a handgun to get 'revenge'. 'It was revenge. He was a cold-hearted and calculated individual,' he told the court,\u00a0CBC reported. Mr Diamond also called the double-murder on August 20 'callous', 'pointless', and the worst crime in the Island's history, adding that it has caused life-long pain for surviving McGuigan family members. In a victim impact statement, Brent's wife and Brendon's mother, Marie McGuigan, who was home at the time but was not targeted by a hell-bent Vuozzo, said 'a part of me died with them that night'. Attack: In February, Vuozzo pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of Brent and the second-degree murder of Brendon. He said that when Cathy was killed, 'Our lives were ruined'. Above, the scene of the killings. Meanwhile, Brent's only daughter, Donna, said she has been consumed by hatred. 'I feel so much anger and hatred that it scares me. I hate that they died this way and it haunts me,' she sobbed. At an earlier hearing, Gerald Quinn, prosecuting, explained how Cathy had been fatally thrown from a car being driven by her father when it was struck by Mr McGuigan, who was driving a truck, in 1970. The youngster's father and two other children also received minor injuries in the crash, but Herbert was not injured,\u00a0The Eastern Graphic\u00a0reported.\u00a0Cathy died on the scene near Commercial Road. Mr McGuigan has since passed away. Referring to Brent and Brendon, Quinn said: 'These two men, by all accounts, were good hard-working men, had no involvement whatsoever in the motor vehicle accident years ago, at all. He added: 'This gentlemen [Vuozzo] had no familiarity with them other than knowing who they were.\u00a0He walked into the home and he shot them both multiple times and killed them.' Thane MacEachern, defending, argued that the defendant had no previous criminal record and had suffered from depression and mental illness prior to the shootings, according to\u00a0CBC. Vuozzo, of Lower Montague, will be 81 by the time he is\u00a0eligible\u00a0for parole. The first 25 years' ineligibility are for his first-degree murder charge, while the other 10 years are for killing Brendon. In 2011, federal legislation was passed allowing courts to impose consecutive periods of parole ineligibility in cases where defendants have been convicted of multiple murders.\n","right_summary":"Alfred Guy Vuozzo, 46, shot dead Brent McGuigan and his son, Brendon.

{"document":"The Justice Department said Tuesday it has opened a civil rights investigation into the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who suffered a fatal spinal-cord injury under mysterious circumstances after he was handcuffed and put in the back of a police van. Baltimore police officials, meanwhile, released the names of six officers who were involved in the arrest and the van transport of the 25-year-old and who've been suspended pending an investigation. But the developments were cold comfort to hundreds of residents who on Tuesday evening took to the streets of West Baltimore to protest the police force in Gray's name. Taking to the streets: Protestors again took to the streets of Baltimore on Tuesday to demonstrate against city police following the death of Freddie Gray, 25. Federal investigation: The protets erupted just as the Justice department announced it had launched an investigation in the the 25-year-old's mysterious death. Vigil: Rev. Jamal Bryant leads a rally outside of the Baltimore Police Department's Western District police station during a march and vigil for Freddie Gray on Tuesday. A woman reaches for a lighter as she and other protestors light candles spelling out the name of Freddie Gray during a vigil at the intersection of Gray's arrest. The protesters rallied site of Gray's arrest and then marched to a police department a couple of blocks away, chanting and holding signs that read: 'Black Lives Matter' and 'No Justice, No Peace' - slogans that have come embody what demonstrators believe is widespread mistreatment of blacks by police. The crowd outside the Western District Police Station on Tuesday included 53-year-old Pricilla Jackson, carrying a sign reading, 'Convict Freddie's killers.' The sign lists the names of the six officers, who've been suspended with pay. The suspended officers were identified as:. Freddie Gray died Sunday after he 'had his spine 80 percent severed at his neck' during an arrest in Baltimore last Sunday. Also on Tuesday: City officials released the names of six cops who were involved in Gray's arrest. They've all been suspended with pay as the investigation continues.

Gloria Darden, at center in hood, mother of Freddie Gray, leads a march with supporters to the site of Gray's arrest. Rev.

Brian Rice, 41, with the department since 1997. Sgt. Alicia White, 30, with the department since 2010. Officer Caesar Goodson, 45, who has been there since 1999. Officers William Porter and Edward Nero and Garrett Miller, who all joined in 2012. Police on horseback were helping to control the crowd and at least one person was detained - an activist who jumped past police barriers - as protesters filled a street the length of a city block. Gray was taken into custody April 12 after police 'made eye contact' with him and another man in an area known for drug activity and the two started running, Baltimore police said. Gray was handcuffed and put in a transport van. At some point during his roughly 30-minute ride, the van was stopped and Gray's legs were shackled when an officer felt he was becoming 'irate,' police said. Protestors raise their fists and candles in solidarity on the streets of West Baltimore to protest the police force in Gray's name. Children and adults alike gather to protest over the death of Gray, 25, who died from spinal injuries on April 19, one week after being taken into police custody. Rev. Jamal Bryant uses a megaphone as he speaks during a vigil and march for Freddie Gray. Protesters link arms as they participate in a vigil for Freddie Gray down the street from the Baltimore Police Department's Western District police station. A protester holds up a sign which read: 'Black lives matter. Justice 4 Freddie' Two people walk towards Baltimore Police Department's Western District police station during the march while one holds a sign which says 'Justice 4 Freddie' Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said that Gray asked for an inhaler, and then several times asked for medical care. He was eventually rushed by ambulance to a hospital. Gray died Sunday - a week after his arrest - of what Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez described as 'a significant spinal injury.' Exactly how he was injured and what happened in the van is still not known. Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said investigators are 'gathering information to determine whether any prosecutable civil rights violation occurred.' It's not uncommon for federal investigators to look into allegations of excessive police force. Justice Department investigations in the last year include probes into the fatal shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri - a case that resulted in no charges against the officer - and an ongoing review of a police chokehold death of a New York City man. There's a high threshold for bringing federal civil rights charges against police officers in such cases. Federal investigators must show an officer willfully deprived a person of his or her civil rights by using more force than the law allows, a standard that's challenging in rapidly unfolding confrontations in which snap judgments are made. Three Baltimore Police Department officers stand behind a barrier while protestors gather nearby. Officers lined up to face the crowd while one protester held up a sign which read: 'Black lives matter' Hundreds of residents took to the streets outside the Baltimore Police Department's Western District station during the march and vigil. Police face the baying crowd who had joined together to protest for Gray, 25, who died from spinal injuries on April 19, one week after being taken into police custody. Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (right, with Police Commissioner Anthony Batts) said that she is frustrated by the lack of answers given in the police report. In the Baltimore case, six police officers have been suspended with pay while local authorities also look into the death. The officers have been on the force anywhere from three years to 18 years. According to court documents, Officer Garrett Miller accused Gray of carrying a switchblade, which was discovered in Gray's pocket after he was stopped. The lawyer for Gray's family said he believes the police had no reason to stop him. 'They've made concessions on lack of probable cause,' attorney Billy Murphy said. 'Running while black is not probable cause. Felony running doesn't exist, and you can't arrest someone for looking you in the eye.' Kim Deachilla, a spokeswoman for the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3, said a law firm that contracts with the union is representing them. The officers' specific roles in the arrest were not released by city officials. Bystander video of the arrest shows officers on bicycles, in patrol cars and outside the transport van. Batts said the reason for Gray's stop is 'a question we have to dig into.' Gray's death has prompted daily protests and a vigil was planned Tuesday evening at the spot where he was arrested. About 100 people had gathered around the start of the rally. Video shows Gray screaming out in pain as he is taken to the van. Spectators thought he had broken legs though police said an autopsy showed he did not. In a video of the arrest, it appears the officers dragged Gray to a police van while he screamed out in pain. Gray died on Sunday morning at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center from his spinal injuries. Harold Perry, 73, a retired small businessman who is nearly blind, said he heard the arrest through his bedroom window. A young man was screaming 'You're hurting me! Get your knee off my back,' Perry said. He said he also heard the young man say, 'I'm an asthmatic.' In the bystander video, Gray is screaming, but it's not clear what he is saying. Capt. Eric Kowalczyk, a department spokesman, said Batts met with all six officers involved in Gray's arrest on Monday. The Baltimore Sun first reported the meeting. At a news conference Monday, officials vowed transparency and pledged to hold those found responsible accountable. Batts said the investigation will be completed by May 1 and the results will be sent to the state attorney's office to determine whether criminal charges will be filed. Batts also said he is ordering that police review and rewrite 'effective immediately' its policies on moving prisoners and providing them with medical attention. News crews meet protesters holding up homemade signs with slogans such as 'Black lives matter' and 'Justice 4 Freddie' Citizens and groups including Justice League of NYC took to the streets Monday to protest following the death of Gray.

{"document":"Brendan Rodgers has met with Raheem Sterling to remind the him of his responsibilities as a role model - but the Liverpool starlet has escaped club punishment after being pictured holding a shisha pipe. Sterling was critcised by Rodgers after being caught on video inhaling nitrous oxide before pictures emerged of him holding a shisha pipe alongside young team-mate Jordon Ibe. However, the midfielder has once again not been fined after the Liverpool boss spoke to him as well as Ibe on Thursday and the club insist the case is now closed. Brendan Rodgers has met with Sterling to remind him of his professional responsibilities at Liverpool. Rodgers and Sterling were locked in discussions at the Melwood training ground on Friday. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe have been pictured holding a shisha pipe. This is the second time Sterling has been pictured with a shisha pipe in the last week. Jordon Ibe has also been warned by Rodgers after the youngster was pictured alongside Sterling. Sterling, 20, and Ibe, 19, were pictured during what is believed to be a visit to a shisha cafe in London earlier this season. Sterling met Liverpool manager Rodgers and he was reminded of his professional responsibilities and warned about the consequences of taking a drug that has been called \u2018hippy crack\u2019. It has been a controversial week for Sterling, who has 14 caps for England, all coming in the wake of his interview with the BBC in which he revealed why he had rejected a \u00a3100,000-a-week deal at Liverpool.

{"document":"A recent college graduate diagnosed with genital herpes is stepping into the limelight in attempt to destigmatize STIs. Ella Dawson, a recent graduate of Wesleyan University who resides in New York City, was diagnosed with herpes two years ago and says she's been dropping the 'herpes bomb' about\u00a0six months after she had her first outbreak. In her essay for\u00a0Women's Health Mag, Dawson recalls meeting a boy at a party who offered her a sip of his beer. I have herpes: Ella Dawson has genital herpes and she is sharing her story so that less people with the virus can feel the guilt and shame that sometimes accompanies the common skin condition. 'Don\u2019t worry,' she remembers him saying. 'I don\u2019t have herpes or anything.' His words hit a sore spot for her and she felt compelled to share her sexual health status. '\"That\u2019s funny,\u2019 I said, with as warm a smile as I could manage. \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s really funny. Because I have genital herpes.\u2019 His face crumbled. Not because I grossed him out \u2014 I could practically see the wheels turning in his brain as he realized he\u2019d made an ignorant joke at someone else\u2019s expense. The guy started apologizing profusely,\"' she wrote in her essay. Dawson said that even though herpes is often the bud of the joke in popular culture, it's a real issue affecting at least one in six Americans. Dawson said that she felt empowered after telling someone she had herpes because it humanized the STI in a way that made it less of a stigma. 'I had seen in the flesh what a simple \"I have herpes\" could do when said fearlessly, without shame,' she wrote. 'Because when a real person \u2014 a woman you know and respect \u2014 casually mentions having herpes, it stops being a punchline and starts being someone's reality.' Don't strain: Dawson says that people who have herpes should not feel 'dirty or wrong' and should be aware that the virus is manageable and more common than people would expect. According to the CDC about 17 per cent\u00a0of people ages 14-19 have genital herpes caused by HSV2. That percentage is only of people who choose to get tested and the actual number of people who have the virus is likely much higher. Even having sex with a condom does not protect someone from the highly contagious virus that only needs skin to skin contact to spread, even if there are no sores present. The Washington Post reports that according to an advocacy group called Project Accept Herpes didn't become a stigma until after the 1970s. '[Herpes] was merely a cold sore in an unusual place until the 1970s,' the group says on their web site. Dr. Peter Anthony Leone, medical director of the North Carolina HIV\/STD Prevention and Control Branch told The Washington Post that the stigmatization of the virus was fueled by conservatives after the 'free love era.' Courage: Ella Dawson has the courage to tell people about \u00a0her virus because it will humanize the problem for sufferers worldwide. 'Herpes was seen as this marker of being promiscuous or bad or evil,' he said. 'But unless you\u2019re in a mutually monogamous relationship with someone who has never had sex, you\u2019re at risk.' Leone said that the sex scare campaign was both emotionally traumatizing and also gave false information about the virus. A study in the Journal of Health Psychology conducted in 2011 found several survey respondents with STIs reported feelings like 'less of a person.' Leone said that safe sex is very important but that herpes is not merely a sexual condition but it primarily a skin condition. 'The way you remove stigma is by bringing something to light,' he said. 'We need a push coming at the federal level to talk about sex in terms of health and move away from the disease model. Sex should be seen as part of being an adult, a healthy thing you can do and just part of your routine healthcare.' Dawson told the Washington Post that she will continue to blog about the virus and her dealings with it. She said that ever since her article on herpes was published she has received several emails from people around the world sharing their own story. Don't sit in the dark: Ellas Dawson says that people should communicate openly about herpes since so many people have it.\n","right_summary":"Ella Dawson, 22, a recent graduate of\u00a0Wesleyan is revealing her genital herpes status in an attempt to destigmatize the STI.

{"document":"A telescopic tube that scans the lungs for cancer is being used by NHS doctors, cutting diagnosis time from days to just 30 minutes. When tumours in the lungs are suspected, patients can face a raft of tests and even surgery to find out if they have the disease, often resulting in an agonising wait before they start lifesaving treatment. Now doctors at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH) are able to start vital treatment much sooner using a single procedure. It even allows them to assess instantly the type and severity of the cancer. Scroll down for video. A finger-width flexible tube called an endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) allows doctors to see inside the lungs and take a tissue sample in one go. The procedure involves inserting the EBUS down the throat, guided by a tiny camera fitted to the tube. An ultrasound scanner attached to one end of the tube takes a scan while a small needle takes a tissue sample. Findings from a three-year trial at UCLH reveal that the method halves the time it takes between a patient\u2019s first hospital appointment and for a decision to be made on the best course of treatment. EBUS patients wait an average of 14 days for a decision, compared with 29 days for those diagnosed via more conventional techniques. And as well as getting a quicker diagnosis, patients who have undergone EBUS survive for longer. Doctors at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (pictured) are able to start vital treatment much sooner using a single procedure. They survive for 503 days after diagnosis, compared with 312 days for people assessed through more traditional methods. This is probably due to the fact that EBUS can more accurately diagnose the type of cancer involved and therefore the type of treatment needed. Consultant Dr Neal Navani, who has been testing the technique, said the results had been so impressive that he now hoped the procedure would be rolled out across the NHS. \u2018EBUS routinely prevents the need for scans, tests and operations and speeds up the route to the correct treatment,\u2019 he says. He adds: \u2018The trial showed that the new procedure is quicker and better \u2013 it halves the time to the start of treatment at no additional cost.\u2019 BBC political editor Nick Robinson announced that doctors found a tumour on his lung earlier this year. More than 40,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer in the UK every year, yet the disease is notoriously difficult to treat as it is often spotted at a late stage. The BBC\u2019s political editor Nick Robinson announced earlier this year that doctors had found a tumour on his lung, and he has since undergone a successful operation to remove the growth. Diagnosing lung cancer can be a challenge \u2013 X-rays are not always definitive as it is hard to distinguish between cancer and other lung conditions. A biopsy is the traditional way to check conclusively whether a patient has lung cancer. However, obtaining a tissue sample can be difficult as lung cancer often spreads to the lymph nodes in the chest and these are hard to reach. This means that surgery may be necessary before a doctor can be sure that the disease is present, resulting in a wait for results. The health of many cancer patients can deteriorate because these delays mean they are not started immediately on lifesaving treatments such as chemotherapy. By comparison, the EBUS allows doctors to look directly into the windpipe and breathing tubes, while the ultrasound scanner can check the lymph glands in the centre of the chest for cancer. One patient who received faster treatment thanks to the EBUS technique is retired sales worker Maureen Mullen. The 65-year-old from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, had already had a tumour removed from her lung in September 2013, and underwent a double mastectomy the following March after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Then in June last year, she began to feel breathless while on holiday in Spain. When she returned home to Britain, she was given the devastating news that she had a new lump behind her breastbone. Her doctors could not be sure what type of cancer it was without investigating further, so they recommended she have the pioneering EBUS procedure. \u2018They said I was a very sick lady,\u2019 reveals Maureen. \u2018My consultant explained the procedure to me and I was taken into the operating theatre and sedated. It was all over so quickly \u2013 there were no side effects from the procedure, no dry mouth or sluggishness, and I felt really positive about the whole process.\u2019 The EBUS revealed Maureen had small cell carcinoma, a form of lung cancer that can spread quickly, and she needed a course of chemotherapy immediately. She started treatment the next day, and after six months of chemo, the tumour was gone. \u2018The EBUS was brilliantly efficient,\u2019 adds Maureen. \u2018By 4pm that day, my cancer had been diagnosed and the appropriate chemotherapy was ordered for me to start the next day. \u2018Had I had a traditional biopsy, who knows where I\u2019d be.\u2019\n","right_summary":"When tumours in lungs are suspected, patients can face a raft of tests.

{"document":"Ronny Deila hailed ultimate impact sub Leigh Griffiths for his hat-trick performance in Celtic\u2019s comeback Premiership win over Kilmarnock. And then Parkhead manager said the striker\u2019s desire to prove him wrong should serve as an example to any player left out of his starting XI. Griffiths took just 19 minutes to score a treble that takes Celtic ever closer to a clean sweep of domestic honours, staking an obvious claim to start in Sunday\u2019s Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness at Hampden. Deila, asked if he thought the forward was trying to prove a point, said: \u2018It looks like that - and that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to do it. That\u2019s what I expect from the other subs as well. You can be angry but the way to get back into the team is to prove you deserve to play - like Leigh did today. Ronny Deila celebrates after Celtic came from behind to beat Kilmarnock at Parkhead on Wednesday. \u2018He was fabulous. You can\u2019t do any better than three goals. His contribution was excellent. And his left foot? He could be a kicker in American football \u2013 he\u2019d be very good, I think. \u2018He\u2019s improved a lot in my time here. He\u2019s training well and as a 24-hour athlete he\u2019s been getting better and better, even though he eats cakes on the bench sometimes. But it\u2019s just a start \u2013 he needs to keep working on small things and he\u2019ll get even more goals. \u2018He and John Guidetti played well together today and that\u2019s something to think about when we play with two strikers.\u2019 Asked if Griffiths is now a certain starter for Sunday, Deila said: \u2018He played very well today so we\u2019ll see.\u2019 Deila shakes hands with Leigh Griffiths, who collects the match ball after his hat-trick. Celtic came back from the loss of a goal early in the second half to crush Killie, Deila saying: \u2018Defensively we were very good for the first 60 minutes, we had the ball all the time and they didn\u2019t have a shot on target. \u2018Our attacking play was too slow, too many square passes and we didn\u2019t create anything. We said at the break we needed to take more risk and get behind them. With Leigh coming on we had a lot more movement and we opened them up and got our goals.\u2019 Celtic could now win the title against closest rivals Aberdeen on May 10 \u2013 if both teams win all their games beforehand. But Deila hopes his team won\u2019t even need to beat the Dons in their own back yard to be crowned champions. Griffiths completes his hat-trick against\u00a0Kilmarnock on Wednesday at Parkhead to move eight points clear. Wednesday\u2019s win took Celtic eight points clear with six games remaining. Should both teams win their remaining league games, an away win at Pittodrie would finish the race. Yet Deila said: \u2018We could win it before Pittodrie. Hopefully we will. It\u2019s possible \u2013 if they lose a game and we win we can do that. \u2018We want to win the title as early as possible and today was a very important win and we\u2019re in to a very important week. If you can get into the last five games eight points ahead we have a very good chance. \u2018. The Parkhead side have two Friday night fixtures against Dundee and St Johnstone \u2013 and won\u2019t play another game on Saturday at 3pm this season. Substitute Griffiths came off the bench to spark Celtic into life after lacklustre first-half. If Celtic wrap up the league flag they will be presented with the trophy before their final home game against Inverness Caledonian Thistle on May 24, the final day of the season. Aberdeen will play St Johnstone in their final game, with the top six completed by a Dundee derby. The final round of bottom six ties could be held on the night of Friday, May 22. The team which finishes 11th will be consigned to a two-leg play-off against the winners of the Championship play-off. With St Mirren 10 points adrift at the foot of the table with just 15 points left to play for, Motherwell will begin their quest to leapfrog Ross County out of the play-off spot with a local Friday night derby against Hamilton. The Fir Park side face Partick Thistle on the final day of the season, while St Mirren face Hamilton.\n","right_summary":"Leigh Griffiths came off the bench to score a hat-trick at Parkhead.

{"document":"Aaron Lennon has finally found something to smile about but Roberto Martinez carried the frown of a man down on his luck as he headed for the bus home. That\u2019s not to say this was a bad day for Everton. They have had plenty of those in this long season over land and sea and could yet finish in the lower half of the Premier League for the first time since 2006. But this one frustrated the Spaniard. His side have found a degree of freedom since their European travels came to an end and in winning three on the trot they started to resemble the side that blitzed their way through last season. Jonjo Shelvey converted from 12 yards to rescue a point for Swansea after Seamus Coleman handled in the penalty box. Shelvey made no mistake from the spot as the former Liverpool midfielder sends Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard the wrong way. The midfielder salutes the home crowd after netting the equaliser for Swansea in the Saturday lunch-time kick-off. Seamus Coleman falls over under the challenge from Marvin Emnes and handles the ball, according to the watching Michael Oliver. Coleman appears to apologise to the visiting section at the full-time whistle. This game, in the mind of Martinez but not many others, should have been the fourth win of a streak. The contentious moment came in the second half when, having led through Lennon\u2019s first-half strike, they conceded a penalty. Seamus Coleman was under pressure from Marvin Emnes, fell forward under marginal contact and then handled the ball. Martinez called for a foul on Coleman; Michael Oliver called a penalty for handball and Jonjo Shelvey buried the kick. Everton\u2019s manager seethed as three points became one and then gave the kind of comments that suggested this fixture was not the dead rubber it appeared to be. \u2018We feel like it was a defeat,\u2019 he said. \u2018It is difficult to take. I am very satisfied with the performance because they are a difficult side to play. Look at the way they open teams up like Arsenal and Manchester United. \u2018For the first 20 or 25 minutes of the second half it was too easy. We just couldn\u2019t find the second goal. You are exposed at 1-0 and something happened. \u2018Seamus felt there was contact. Seamus loses his balance and as he falls he ends up touching the ball with his hand. There was no goalscoring threat whatsoever. The referee in those moments can make his own decision but I think it was very harsh. \u2018He should have applied a bit of common sense. From my point of view, seeing it in a biased way, I would have wanted to see a free-kick awarded. Two or three actions straight after it was exactly the same and given as a free-kick. That is disappointing.

Lennon, on loan from Tottenham for the remainder of the season, fires in his second goal in three games for Roberto Martinez's side. Lennon's strike in the 41st minute came against the run of play with Swansea having dominated much of the opening half. While an argument could be made for the penalty, the comments on performance were less easy to accept. Swansea did not deserve to win but they certainly did not deserve to lose a game in which Garry Monk felt Arouna Kone might been sent off. There was also a wonderful goal from Shelvey disallowed in the first half because Wayne Routledge was adjudged to have fouled Leighton Baines. It appeared to be a harsh call. Monk said: \u2018I was disappointed with the disallowed goal. I thought it was very harsh on what could have been one of the goals of the season.\u2019 So, one referee and two disgruntled managers. Monk at least had the consolation of watching Shelvey have one of those days when the correct parts of his brain are in operation. He is capable of winning matches and losing matches - a blessing and a curse dictated by his emotions. But he was excellent here, driving Swansea early in the game before Lennon put Everton in front on 41 minutes. Fittingly it was Shelvey whose penalty ultimately claimed Swansea's 47th point of the season \u2013 equalling their Premier League record from 2012. Monk said: \u2018The plan was three points and to get it (the record) in front of our fans.

Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer said on\u00a0Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor on Monday night that\u00a0Bowe Bergdahl 'had Afghan contacts and he was actually trying to offer himself up with the Taliban.' The former military intelligence officer said he had been told the information by  two senior sources who knew about a 2009 Naval Criminal Investigative Service investigation into Bergdahl's\u00a0activities. Scroll down for video. Bowe Bergdahl, the U.S. Army Sergeant who left his post in Afghanistan and was held by the Taliban for five years was found to have be 'going over to the other side with a deliberate plan,' according to a former military intelligence officer. The investigation reportedly included a forensic review of Bergdahl's\u00a0computer which showed his apparent intent to travel to Uzbekistan. 'He had made contact with local Afghans and wanted to be moved to Uzbekistan and then made contact with the Russians because he wanted to talk to Russian organized crime,'\u00a0Shaffer told O'Reilly. 'Clearly he was not all there relating to what he was doing. I think we're going to see more and more, as this report is made public that there were a number of disconcerting things within Bergdahl.' Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer (pictured) \u00a0said on Fox News ' 'The O'Reilly Factor' on Monday night that Bowe Bergdahl 'had Afghan contacts and he was actually trying to offer himself up with the Taliban. Both are very severe' He said the NCIS investigaiton, \u00a0which included interviews with squad mates, indicated that\u00a0Bergdahl made contact with an Afghan in an attempt to prepare for his departure. Bowe\u00a0Bergdahl will face charges under articles 85 and 99 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 'Desertion with Intent to Shirk Important or Hazardous Duty':. Article 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he 'quits his unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service.' It can carry a death sentence but the military won't seek that option in the Bergdahl case. MAXIMUM SENTENCE: 5 years in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay. 'Misbehavior Before the Enemy by Endangering the Safety of a Command, Unit or Place':. Article 99 charges a servicemember with running away from a fighting enemy, throwing down his weapons, abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit, or otherwise purposely failing 'to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy.' MAXIMUM SENTENCE: life in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay. Army officials announced Thursday that his Article 32 hearing will be held July 8 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas -\u00a0he is charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. That proceeding is similar to a civilian grand jury. From there, it could be referred to a court-martial and go to trial. His attorney says Bergdahl was trying to find a U.S. general officer to report a disturbing situation when he left his combat outpost. Eugene Fidell, the attorney leading Bergdahl's defense, said in a letter released this week that the Army major general who investigated Bergdahl's capture in Afghanistan found he did not intend to remain away from his base permanently. Bergdahl disappeared in June, 2009 from a combat post in Paktika Province in eastern Afghanistan and was captured by the Taliban. He spent five years as a prisoner of war before he was freed last summer in a prisoner swap that angered members of congress members and some members of his unit. After an investigation of the circumstances of his capture, Bergdahl was charged this week with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, counts that could lead to life in prison. Documents released by his defense lawyers suggested the tack they may take in defending Bergdahl. The papers also included a statement from Bergdahl about his attempts to escape from his Taliban captors and his beatings while a prisoner. In a March 2 letter to Army General Mark Milley, who was responsible for deciding how to proceed with the case, Fidell said an investigation by an Army major general had concluded that Bergdahl did not plan to desert. 'While hedging its bets, the report basically concludes that Sergeant Bergdahl did not intend to remain away from the Army permanently, as classic 'long' desertion requires,' Fidell wrote. 'It also concludes that his specific intent was to bring what he thought were disturbing circumstances to the attention of the nearest general office,' he added. Bowe Bergdahl, shown before his handover to US troops in May 2014. Fidell declined to elaborate further on Friday. Bergdahl was released in exchange for five Taliban leaders held at Guantanamo Bay. They were sent to Qatar and had to remain there for a year. Some U.S. lawmakers were angered by Bergdahl's release because they were not given 30 days notice before the transfer of the Guantanamo prisoners, as required by law. Some fellow soldiers also said he had deserted. 'While many Americans have taken a broader and more sympathetic view, the depth and breadth of the current hostility to Sergeant Bergdahl are extraordinary and have enveloped the case with a lynch mob atmosphere,' Fidell said. 'Taliban five': The terror leaders traded for Bergdahl were (top, from left): Abdul Haq Wasiq, Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mohammad Nabi Omari; and (bottom from left): Mohammad A Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori. He faces up to life in prison if convicted of misbehavior before the enemy. A former platoon-mate of Bergdahl told Daily Mail Online that Bergdahl is trying to win a public-relations battle with new claims about his defense strategy. CNN reported based on a Pentagon leak, that Bergdahl told Army investigators he left his forward operating base in 2009 so he could report 'a breakdown in discipline and order' to military higher-ups \u2013 not with desertion in mind. 'This is clearly just a stunt to build sympathy before they go to trial,' said retired Sgt. Jordan Vaughn, who spoke for the first time since the Army announced Bergdahl would be court-martialed. 'No logical person would ever take the actions he undertook for the reasons he is now saying,' Vaughn told Daily Mail Online. He said the claim broadcast by CNN is 'ridiculous,' and that the Army's decision to charge Bergdahl with desertion is 'in direct conflict' with any claim that he intended to be a whistle-blower. CNN reported that a Defense Department official said Bergdahl had 'concerns about leadership issues at his base. 'He needs to be held responsible for what he did, for abandoning his post, for abandoning his platoon, for putting thousands of American soldiers, Marines and the whole United States military, thousands of members, in more danger, putting us into spots we wouldn't already have been in, had he not walked away,' he said. President Barack Obama announced the return of Bergdahl on May 31, 2014 in a White House Rose Garden press event as the soldier's parents Jani (left) and Bob (right) looked on. Vaughn also noted that his decision 'cost the US multiple soldiers' lives, five Taliban POWs, and the incredible monetary expense of searching for him.' However, both Cornelison and Buetow, who have left the US Army, stopped short of demanding that Sgt Bergdahl face prison. 'I don't want to ruin his life,' said Buetow. 'He does need to be dishonorably discharged, have all his ranks taken away, and he does not need to receive any benefits or back pay.' He added that he was proud the military had reached its decision despite the fact it would heap further pressure on the Obama administration for negotiating with the Taliban over a man accused of deserting. 'You can't get around the fact this makes some people look bad,' he said. But they had little sympathy for Sgt Bergdahl's account of being beaten and tortured during his time in Taliban captivity. 'He wouldn't have been put in that position, he wouldn't have been tortured, he wouldn't have been put through all that hardship if he'd never walked away,' said Cornelison. The punishments suggested by the veterans are within the range open to the court. It can reduce him to E-1, forfeit his pay and give him a dishonorable discharge.\n","right_summary":"Lt. Col.

The extremist group's first English bulletin aired on Tuesday on its al-Bayan radio network, which already boasts updates in both Arabic and Russian. The nine-and-a-half minute broadcast, which begins and ends with traditional sounding Arabic music, is hosted by a man with an American accent, who takes the listener through the main events of the day. Round up: The broadcast, hosted by a man with an American accent, boasted of ISIS victories during the day. Pictured: Fighting in Yarmouk was high on the agenda of the radio broadcast. It provided an overview of the militants activities in Iraq, Syria and Libya, discussing a range of topics \u00a0- including the alleged death of an ISIS commander in the Yarmouk refugee camp in the Syrian capital, Damascus, a suicide bombing in the Iraqi city of Kirkuk and mortar attacks on militias in Sirte, Libya. It also boasts of ISIS fighters 'roasting the flesh' of their opponents, car bombs killing people and destroying an 'idol' and so-called 'martyrdom operations'. It ends thanking the listener for 'tuning in'. But the radio station is not the only option ISIS commanders are using to reach out to English-speakers: they already have a monthly propaganda magazine, Dabiq. The magazine - named after the Syrian town where a 'malahim', the equivalent to an Armageddon, in which the Muslims ultimately prevail - has so far issued eight editions, covering events like those in Paris and Sydney. It also boasts about some of its worst atrocities in the pages of the glossy booklet - which has even outlined a religious justification for slavery.

Exactly why ISIS commanders have decided to branch out from print to radio now is not known, but it comes within days of it being revealed a new school of nursing in the militants' de facto capital Raqqa would only accept English-speaking applicants. Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after they finish training.

{"document":"Celtic's title prospects 'look great' following their 2-0 win over bottom side St Mirren in Paisley on Friday night, according to Stefan Johansen. The Norway midfielder clinched the points with a 79th minute penalty after wide-man James Forrest had finished off a well-worked Hoops move from close range to open the scoring. It took the Parkhead men eight points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the Scottish Premiership with both clubs having played 29 games albeit the Dons can reduce the deficit against Partick Thistle on Saturday. Celtic midfielder\u00a0Stefan Johansen believes his side's title aspirations 'look great' after their 2-0 win at St Mirren. Ronny Deila's side have only lost one league game this year and take four successive victories into the home match against Partick Thistle on Wednesday night which encouraged Johansen, 24, to say: 'It looks great for us now. It's nine games left in the league and it's going to be difficult to take us now. 'This was another important win and we just need to keep focusing now on every game over the next couple of weeks. 'I don't think we're unbeatable but you can say there is a huge confidence in the team now. 'I think we are starting to look fitter and we have much more of the ball because we are playing with a higher tempo and that's the way the manager wants us to play.' Johansen scored Celtic's second goal at St Mirren from the penalty spot on 79 minutes. Deila criticised the 'terrible' pitches in Scottish football after the game, claiming the surface at St Mirren was another that was difficult to master. The visitors were certainly not at their best but Johansen was glad the international break had not upset the Hoops' rhythm too much. The former Stromsgodset player said: 'Some of the guys have had a few days off and some of the guys were away with the international teams so it was good to be back together and be prepared for the rest of the season. 'St Mirren frustrated us for a while. They played well, especially in the first half and credit to them for that. The victory for Celtic manager Ronny Deila's side now means they have won four successive league matches. 'But we know that we had the ball so much that they would need to run. It was going to be difficult for them over 90 minutes so we knew it would open up.' Gary Teale is hoping his St Mirren side, who ended the game still four points behind Motherwell, are not cut adrift before the split, which comes after they play the Steelmen on Tuesday night and third-bottom Ross County the following Monday. He said: 'We need to make sure we're within three points of Ross County or Motherwell after the next two games. 'If we can do that then that will give us a fighting chance.'\n","right_summary":"Celtic won 2-0 away  St Mirren on Good Friday in the Scottish Premiership.

The Queen's Guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera. He lost his footing and slid sideways, knocking his bearskin on the side of the box and dropping his rifle. The Queen's Guard (pictured) slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace last week. Unfortunately for him, the entire incident was caught on a tourist's camera. The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened. But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment. Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon. Mr Meadwell, 50, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards. Tourist David Meadwell shot this footage of the Changing of the Guard last week when the incident unfolded. The moment it all started to go wrong: The guard leans heavily to the side as he appears to slip. The unidentified young guard's legs appear to get a bit tangled as he tries to turn to march away. The guard, wearing full regalia, falls heavily to the floor still clutching his rifle following the slip up. 'The first group changed successfully, without any problems, and so I decided to video the next group doing it. 'I didn't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying. There were quite a few people around and there were a lot of gasps as he went down. 'I think he just slipped on a manhole cover, he looked so embarrassed.' The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots. Tourists gather in their thousands to watch the changing of the guard outside Buckingham Palace at 11.30am every day in the summer and every other day in the winter. The Guard comprises two detachments, one each for Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, under the command of the Captain of The Queen's Guard.

{"document":"Tough stance: Health minister Marisol Touraine wants to impose fines and prison sentences for inciting binge drinking. They look down on our food, our weather and even our language. Now France has cocked a snooty nose at our drinking habits, too \u2013 and is blaming us for exporting them across the Channel. French health chiefs say the UK is responsible for causing a sharp rise in the number of youngsters who binge-drink. It has slammed the practice of going out to get drunk as an 'Anglo-Saxon phenomenon' and says it is being copied by increasing numbers of youths on the continent. But critics have said it's a case of double standards for a country where children are encouraged to drink wine at the table from a relatively early age. The latest figures reveal that almost half of French 18 to 25 years olds have consumed alcohol with the sole aim of getting drunk \u2013 compared to 33 per cent ten years ago. The rise in binging is particularly high among young women, soaring from eight per cent who admitted they had done it in 2005, to three times that number by 2015. Now France's state health watchdog has claimed the sharp increase is due to French youths copying the English. Francis Bourdillon, head of the National Institute of Prevention and Health Education, said: 'This is an Anglo-Saxon phenomenon that's starting to creep into the generation of the 15-24-year-olds. 'Consumption of alcohol in France is particularly worrying among young people and especially among young women. 'Besides the obvious health concerns, binge drinking can also lead to violence against women, sometimes fatal drunken accidents, and unprotected sex.' Bad influence: French officials claim binge drinking is an Anglo-Saxon phenomenon, pictured here on TV programme Booze Britain. Sophisticated: French officials would prefer youngsters to move back to the more traditional pastimes such as a picnic lunch, after new figures revealed more youths are drinking solely to get drunk. The slur on the British comes in the same week that Health Minister Marisol Touraine presents her new health bill to the government, which includes reforms to crack down on France's binge-drinking culture. Ms Touraine said: 'We have to put a stop to drunkenness that does such damage to young people. 'This trend is a risk to their own health, and as a result puts an extra strain on the health service. 'Some may accuse the government of wanting to arrest people for having fun. But it is our job to encourage citizens to moderate their alcohol intake.' Her new law would impose fines of up to \u00a312,000 for inciting someone under 18 to get drunk, and fines of \u00a35,000 or six months in prison for inciting someone of any age to binge-drink.

{"document":"Michael Shepard, 35, allegedly molested at least seven children within 18 months of his release. A serial pedophile in Florida has been arrested for molesting at least seven young children in his apartment complex just 18 months after he was released from prison by officials who voted to give him a second chance. Michael Shepard, 35, conned parents into letting him babysit their kids and was frequently seen riding around the neighborhood with children on his scooter, authorities say. When asked about the sex offender notification he gave to his neighbors, he claimed that he had been in prison for a 'Romeo and Juliet romance' with a preacher's daughter. Police now say he did everything he could to win the confidence of the parents at Cedar Hollow apartments in Pinellas Park so that he could prey on their children. He is accused of horrific sexual attacks on seven children, both boys and girls. His youngest alleged victim is five years old. All of them were age 12 or younger. Detectives say he tempted them with video games, candy and trips to McDonald's. He also drove young children to his 'hideout' in the woods where he allegedly forced them to perform sexual acts on him and raped them. Parents even let their children sleep over at his apartment. The Tampa Bay Times\u00a0reports that Shepard, who has a history of molesting children dating back 20 years, served 15 years in prison for molesting two boys, age six and nine, at a roller rink in 1998. As his term in prison neared its end, authorities filed petitions to keep him locked up under the Jimmy Ryce Act, a Florida law that allows sex offenders to be kept behind bars past their sentences if they're likely to re-offend. Shepard posted these sex offender notifications around his apartment complex, but told parents he was convicted of sleeping with a preacher's teenage daughter. Parents soon began to trust Shepard and even let him babysit their kids, authorities say. Two psychologists examined Shepard and found that he wasn't likely molest children again after his release, the Times reports. Dr Karen C. Parker testified on behalf of Shepard at a hearing. Dr\u00a0Martin Falb, the state's expert, diagnosed him with\u00a0pedophilia, depressive disorder and adult antisocial behavior. He said Shepard was likely to re-offend. But at a hearing, he said he was 'straddling the fence' on whether Shepard should be kept locked up or be released, according to the Times. According to the newspaper, Shepard had been caught having sex with other inmates in prison and had a confrontation with his live-in lover, his step-brother, after his release. When he  moved into Cedar Hollow, he was required to post flyers to his neighbors informing him that he was a convicted sex offender. He still managed to win the trust of parents in the neighborhood. Within a month, a young boy was allowed to spend the night with him.

The Mayor of New York is allegedly entering the race as a 'leftist' alternative to Clinton in the hopes that this will see him represent the party in the 2016 elections. This claims come in the wake of a television appearance last week, just hours before Clinton announced her candidacy, where de Blasio refused to back her. Scroll down for video. The Mayor of New York is allegedly entering preparing to run for president as a 'leftist' alternative to Hillary Clinton, according to a source within the Democratic Party. De Blasio's intentions to throw his hat in the ring as Democrat presidential candidate comes from a 'national party operative', according to the New York Post. The mayor's bid for presidency is backed by the Working Families Party, and he hopes that left-leaning 'progressive activists' will join them in supporting him over the coming months, the source claims. 'De Blasio and his advisers are trying to position the mayor as the 'draft' candidate for the left in 2016. That's why he refused to endorse Hillary last week,' the party operative told the Post. The 53-year-old has yet to back Clinton, despite the fact that he was campaign manager of her U.S. Senate bid in 2000, an indication that the rumours of his intentions to run for president may be true. The New York City mayor, known to be more liberal than Clinton on most issues, surprised many Democrats when he declined to endorse his former boss during an interview last week. Behind her back? Bill de Blasio has yet to endorse Hillary Clinton as the Democrats' presidential candidate, despite the fact that he was campaign manager of her U.S. Senate bid in 2000.

'She's a tremendous public servant,' the mayor continued. 'I think she is one of the most qualified people to ever run for this office. And by the way, thoroughly vetted, we can say that. But we need to see the substance.' De Blasio has taken several steps to raise his profile in recent weeks, including making a bid for the 2016 Democratic National Convention, hosting a meeting of liberals at Gracie Mansion this month and traveling to Nebraska and Iowa \u2014 site of the first nominating caucus \u2014 \u00a0last  week to champion the fight against income inequality.

{"document":"Arsene Wenger insists his woeful record against Jose Mourinho will have no bearing on Arsenal's top-of-the-table clash with Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Wenger has failed to win in 12 games against Mourinho across the Portuguese coach's two spells at Stamford Bridge, drawing five and losing seven of their clashes. But the Arsenal manager says the past shared between the two managers on the touchline in Sunday's 4pm kick-off will be irrelevant as the Barclays Premier League's top two sides face off. Arsene Wenger has drawn five and lost seven of his 12 clashes with Jose Mourinho ahead of facing Chelsea. Wenger and Mourinho rowed on the touchline in October's 2-0 win for Chelsea in the reverse fixture. 'I think we have not always lost in 12 attempts. We have been close,' Wenger said. 'Having said that, the result on Sunday will just be down to the performance on the day. We are on a good run and we have an opportunity at home to beat them and we want to take it. 'We have a good run of form and good belief and solidarity. We have passed many tests recently when we were questioned. We have another test on Sunday that we want to pass. 'Chelsea's strengths are they have been very efficient on counter attacks and set-pieces as well. We have to nullify their strengths.' Asked about his frosty relationship with Mourinho, Wenger said: 'I do not want to talk about that. What is interesting for people is when the game starts at 4pm we have a great game. It is not about the relationship between the managers.' The managers of London's two biggest clubs have long had a frosty relationship in the opposing dugouts. Cesc Fabregas set up Diego Costa to seal a 2-0 victory for Chelsea against Arsenal earlier this season. Arsenal are 10 points behind Chelsea but come into the game on the back of excellent form. Wenger said: 'Look, mathematically it will be possible, yes, but Chelsea has their future and the championship in their hands. We can get closer and we have an opportunity to do that at home and want to take it.' Wenger added: 'They have been very consistent until now. They have fewer losses than any team. The Premier League rewards consistency. On that front they gave been defensively very strong and consistent.' Fabregas gets ahead of his now-team-mate Branislav Ivanovic to score against Chelsea for Arsenal in 2010. Sunday's game marks the return of former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who will be wearing Chelsea blue at the Emirates for the first time. Fabregas left for Barcelona in 2011. Arsenal supporters are expected to give their former hero a hot reception after he joined their fierce rivals, but Wenger has asked for some respect for one of their best players of the last decade. 'I want every player to be respected, and Cesc Fabregas when he comes to the Emirates on Sunday to be respected like he deserves,' he said. Asked if he regretted not signing Fabregas in the summer when he had the option to, Wenger added: 'The regret I have is that he wanted to leave here. 'This club and myself had a very positive influence on Cesc\u2019s life, so I would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here. I believe I would rather it was the other way around.' Wenger is without Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mikel Arteta on Sunday, while Per Mertesacker is rated as '50-50' by his manager having not trained at all this week. Gunners fans welcome back Fabregas\u00a0with Barcelona, but the reception is likely to be more frosty this time.\n","right_summary":"Arsenal face table-topping Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.

{"document":"Malala Yousafzai's stellar career has included a Nobel Peace Prize. Last week, she made it into outer space. A NASA astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from Pakistan, who was gravely wounded by a Pakistani Taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls' to go to school. It took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens. Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. \"My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color),\" Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. \"It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner.\" As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical. When girls around the world also get educations, it increases human potential. \"We desperately need the brainpower of all smart people to solve some of humanity's most difficult problems, and we can't afford to reject half the population's,\" Mainzer wrote.\n","right_summary":"Astrophysicist Amy Mainzer says she was was touched by Malala's story of determination.

{"document":"Nasa has selected a variety of companies to work on projects to create advanced space technologies, including faster methods of propulsion. Other projects to be worked on include improved habitats for humans, and small satellites to explore deep space. And one of the companies in the 12 Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextStep) says they have an engine that could get humans to Mars in just 39 days. Scroll down for video. Nasa has selected a variety of companies to work on projects to create advanced space technologies, including a faster method of propulsion known as Vasimr (illustrated), which could apparently get to Mars in a matter of weeks, not months. The Vasimr engine - which uses plasma as a propellant - is being developed by the Ad Astra Rocket company in Texas. Their engine shot to fame a few years ago when it was revealed that it could drastically reduce the journey time to Mars from months to weeks - although it may require a nuclear power source. And following the successful test of a prototype in 2013, it seems Nasa is now considering it for use on a future mission to Mars. Short for Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, Vasimr works with plasma, an electrically charged gas that can be heated to extreme temperatures by radio waves and controlled and guided by strong magnetic fields. The magnetic field also insulates nearby structures so exhaust temperatures well beyond the melting point of materials can be achieved. In rocket propulsion, the higher the temperature of the exhaust gases, the higher their velocity and the higher the fuel efficiency. Plasma rockets feature exhaust velocities far above those achievable by their chemical cousins, so their fuel consumption is extremely low. \u2018We are thrilled by this announcement and proud to be joining forces with Nasa in the final steps of the technology maturation,\u2019 said Dr Franklin Chang Diaz, Ad Astra\u2019s Chairman and CEO, in a statement. \u2018We look forward to a very successful partnership as we jointly advance the technology to flight readiness.\u2019 Over three years, Nasa will give the company about \u00a36.8 million ($10 million) to get the engine almost ready to fly in space. This will be achieved with a demonstration of their new prototype, the VX-200-SS, which will be able to fire continuously for more than 100 hours. A previous test in 2013 saw Ad Astra complete 10,000 successful high power firings of a Vasimr prototype. However, this involved short duration bursts for less than a minute. Proving the engine works for more than 100 hours will be key to it one day being used on a spacecraft. The Vasimr engine is seen here being tested.\u00a0Short for Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, Vasimr works with plasma, an electrically charged gas that can be heated to extreme temperatures by radio waves and controlled and guided by strong magnetic fields. In rocket propulsion, the higher the temperature of the exhaust gases, the higher their velocity and the higher the fuel efficiency. Plasma rockets like Vasimr (illustrated) feature exhaust velocities far above those achievable by their chemical cousins, so their fuel consumption is extremely low. The Vasimr engine could be part of the entire spacecraft that will ultimately take astronauts to Mars. The rocket that will send them on their way will be the Space Launch System, illustrated, which will complete an unmanned flight in 2019 - and it will have room for some secondary payloads to go to deep space. Owing to the orbits of Earth and Mars, there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place. Our planets come as close to each other as 33.9 million miles (54.6 million km), but can be as distant as 250 million miles (400 million km). For this reason spacecraft to Mars, such as the Curiosity rover, have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned. The next window is open from January 2016 to April 2016, and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet. For a future manned mission, they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in another. Just getting there will take up to nine months. The astronauts will then be there waiting for a year until they can come back, again taking up to nine months - a total of around three years. Whether an engine such as Vasimr could shorten the time it would take to cover the distance, though, remains to be seen. With this and other technologies, Nasa said in a statement they want to develop exploration capabilities around the moon, and at Mars. \u2018Commercial partners were selected for their technical ability to mature key technologies and their commitment to the potential applications both for government and private sector uses,\u2019 said William Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for Human Exploration and Operations at Nasa Headquarters. \u2018This work ultimately will inform the strategy to move human presence further into the solar system.\u2019 Three advanced electric propulsion projects, including Vasimr, will develop engines that operate in the 50 to 300 kilowatt range. By comparison, current electric propulsion used by Nasa - such as the ion engine on the Dawn spacecraft - operates at less than five kilowatts. Meanwhile, seven companies have been picked to work on the habitats that will house astronauts as they make their way to Mars in the 2030s. While the Orion capsule will take astronauts to and from Earth, it can only sustain a crew of four for 21 days. To make the journey to Mars, expected to last anywhere from several months to three years, astronauts will need to live in some other structure. Nasa will be hoping one of the projects it is funding will find a way to house the astronauts for the grueling journey to and from the red planet.

To make the journey to Mars, expected to last anywhere from several months to three years, astronauts will need to live in some other structure. Previously, Boeing outlined the six steps needed to land and return on Mars (illustrated). Two are already in production - the Orion spacecraft and SLS rocket. The other four things needed are a large 'tug' spacecraft, a habitat, lander and an ascent vehicle - all of which Nasa is hoping to develop in the next decade or so. Nasa is also asking companies to development capabilities to sustain a crew of four for 60 days in cis-lunar space - between Earth and the moon - with the ability to scale up to Mars missions. The companies selected include Bigelow Aerospace, who are creating an inflatable habitation module - a prototype of which will be attached to the ISS in 2018. And finally, two companies have been selected to develop small satellites - CubeSats - to launch as secondary paylods on the first flight of Nasa\u2019s huge Space Launch System rocket in 2019. As the rocket is so powerful, it will give these CubeSats a rare opportunity to explore deep space, as opposed to remaining in Earth orbit.

The theft happened sometime between April 1 and 7. The man said the only time he and his hired hand were away from the farm was on Easter Sunday, according to the Austin Daily Herald. Police have no suspects. Chief Deputy Mark May said that there is a market for bull semen because it helps farmers on transportation costs of putting a bull and a cow in the same pen to breed. 'A lot of people purchase bid on it or purchase it instead of transporting their animals to and from a site,' he said. 'They can just purchase a vial of bull semen and inseminate their cow and I guess it's just more reliable that way.' Mark May, chief deputy of the Mower County Sheriff's Office said that there is a market for bull semen because it helps farmers reduce transportation costs of animals.

{"document":"Various types of renewable energy such as solar and wind are often touted as being the solution to the world\u2019s growing energy crisis. But one researcher has come up with a novel idea that could trump them all - a biological solar panel that works around the clock. By harnessing the electrons generated by plants such as moss, he said he can create useful energy that could be used at home or elsewhere. A University of Cambridge scientist has revealed his green source of energy. By using just moss he is able to generate enough power to run a clock (shown). He said panels of plant material could power appliances in our homes. And the technology could help farmers grow crops where electricity is scarce. Dr Paolo Bombelli will present his research as part of the Pint of Science festival, which is running from 18 to 20 May in 50 cities across nine countries. His idea is relatively simple - by wiring up plants to an electro-chemical system, he is able to harness the waste electrons and energy produced during the photosynthesis process. And the results are surprisingly efficient. He demonstrated how a smartphone-sized block of moss could be used to power a digital clock. The Pint of Science festival is taking place from Monday 18 to Wednesday 20 May 2015. It sees scientists of various disciplines give talks in pubs around the world, with topics ranging from the brain to space, that the public can attend for \u00a33 - the \u2018price of a pint\u2019. Dr Paolo Bombelli, with his moss-powered clock, is one of the scientists taking part. This year more than 600 science evenings will take place in 50 cities across nine countries. Cities in the UK include Bristol, London, Manchester and Southampton. A full schedule can be found on their website. An A4-sized area of leaves - about 93 square inches (600 square centimetres) - could charge four AA batteries in one hour on a typical sunny day. Dr Bombelli said his inspiration came from the movie The Matrix. \u2018In that movie, they try to generate electrical energy, power, from humans,\u2019 he explained. \u2018And although it was a bit crude, the concept is actually correct. \u2018But there are perhaps less ethical issues if you take electrons from photosynthetic organisms than humans.\u2019 The apparatus required is also relatively simple - cables, some water and a plant. At the moment, Dr Bombelli is trying to find a way to increase the \u2018flux\u2019 of electrons emitted by a plant, making more energy available. \u2018If we can crack this, we can get a very large flux of electrons coming out, then we can build a biological solar panel,\u2019 he told MailOnline. Dr Bombelli said his inspiration came from the 1999 movie The Matrix. \u2018In that movie, they try to generate electrical energy, power, from humans,\u2019 he explained, shown in this image from the movie. 'But there are perhaps less ethical issues if you take electrons from photosynthetic organisms than humans' An A4-sized area of leaves - about (93 square inches (600 square centimetres) - could charge four AA batteries in one hour on a typical sunny day. The ultimate goal is to develop panels that generate five watts per square metre (11 square ft). By comparison, a solar panel generates 150 to 200 watts per square metre. Dr Paolo Bombelli  presented his research at a preview  of the Pint of Science festival (left). He is adamant that regular moss (stock image right) could provide an additional source of renewable energy to complement others that are available. For example, he said people could have one of these panels on the roof of their house to power certain appliances in their home. The goal is to generate up to five watts per square metre (11 square feet). By comparison, a solar panel generates 150 to 200 watts per square metre. The uses are not just in the home, though.\u00a0Dr Bombelli said in regions where people don\u2019t have access to energy, biological solar panels could be useful for tasks such as growing crops. People could be shown how to build the simple systems and, unlike solar panels which require technical expertise to fix, the biological solar panels can be fixed easily. \u2018To assemble one is not too difficult,\u2019 he explained. And to demonstrate just how useful the technology can be, Dr Bombelli is gearing up to deploy a plant-powered system in London Zoo. A trap camera powered by moss will be installed in the next four to eight weeks, and ultimately the same camera could be used to capture images of animals in the wild. Rice farming is one area Dr Bombelli sees his technology being useful. It could help power technology in areas where electricity is scarce, possibly increasing yields. Shown is a stock image of rice paddy fields in India, one region Dr Bombelli said his technology could be useful. He noted that there are limitations: the technology is not very mobile, and its power output is low compared to other renewable energies. Nonetheless he thinks it could be part of a \u2018portfolio of renewable technology\u2019 to generate electricity. \u2018We don\u2019t really think the world is going to be powered by this technology, but it could play a role,\u2019 he said.\n","right_summary":"University of Cambridge scientist has revealed his green source of energy.

{"document":"Teller Lake has become a giant fish bowl. The lake in Boulder, Colorado, has been invaded by thousands of gold fish, which wildlife officials say started as someone dumping 'four or five' of their pets in the water two or three years ago. The animals have now multiplied to over 3,000 or 4,000, it's believed, and are threatening to over-run the natural species in the lake, by eating up all their resources and spreading unnatural diseases. 'Dumping your pets into a lake could bring diseases to native animals and plants as well as out-compete them for resources,'Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) spokeswoman Jennifer Churchill told ABC News. Scroll down for video. Invasion:\u00a0Lake Teller in Boulder has been invaded by 3,000 to 4,000 goldfish, which wildlife officials say started as someone dumping 'four or five' of their pets in the water two or three years ago. Overrun: Goldfish are not a native species in Colorado and are very harmful to the local aquatic ecosystem. Threat:\u00a0Fish that are native to the lake that are now being threatened by the invasive goldfish include channel catfish, blue gill fish and sun fish. In danger: Local officials are now considering two options - electroshocking the fish or draining the lake. Worried:\u00a0Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) spokeswoman Jennifer Churchill has warned people against dumping their pets into local environments, saying it can be incredibly dangerous. 'Everything can be affected. Non-native species can potentially wipe out the fishery as we've put it together.' Crews now face the arduous tasking of attempting to get rid of all the gold fish, but there are only two options. One is to drain the 12-acre lake completely, or use electrofishing, where the fish are stunned by an electrical current and removed while they are paralyzed. The latter is the most likely option. Problem: The consequences of introducing a foreign species is far-reaching, officials say. Scene: Teller Lake stretches about 12 acres in Boulder, Colorado. An electrical current is put in the water in sections and the stunning brings the fish to the surface. It was a successful method used in November 2012 at Thunderbird Lake, also in Boulder, to remove koi goldfish from the water that had been improperly introduced. Some 2,275 fish were removed in the process. 'Most people don't realize the far-reaching effects of introducing exotic species to the environment,' Ken Kehmeier, senior aquatic biologist for CPW, told The Denver Chanel. 'Nonnative species can be devastating to native populations by causing disease outbreaks and creating competition unbalance. Removal: In November 2012, over 2,000 koi goldfish were removed from the nearby\u00a0Thunderbird Lake by 'electrofishing', where the fish are shocked with an electric current and paralyzed, causing them to float. Effective: With electroshocking, crews go out in a boat and stun the fish to paralyze and then collect them. 'It's an issue that anyone concerned with our environment should know about.' Despite the amount of fish in the lake, officials have warned locals against retrieving some of the fish and taking them home as pets.

{"document":"Two years ago, Rafa Benitez was in charge of Chelsea and John Terry's glittering career at Stamford Bridge was in danger of fizzling out. In April 2013, the Spanish manager declared that Terry could no longer play two games a week and that controversial decision, twinned with a persistent knee injury, meant the former England international made just 14 appearances for his beloved in the 2012-13 campaign. Fast forward to 2015, the Blues captain has one hand on the Premier League trophy after arguably his most impressive season at the club - during which he has played a part in each of their 33 games so far. Chelsea captain John Terry is on course to appear in all 38 Premier League matches for his side this season.

If Terry manages to make appearances in all of Chelsea's remaining fixtures against Leicester, Crystal Palace, Liverpool, West Brom and Sunderland, he will beat the 37 domestic appearances he made during his side's last title-winning season in 2009-10. And he made 36 in 2004-05 and again the following season - his other two Premier League title triumphs. During his time as Blues boss, Rafa Benitez (left) believed Terry couldn't play two games in a week. Terry had to settle for a place on the bench under Benitez and made just 14 Premier League appearances. Speaking after the 0-0 draw with Arsenal on Sunday, manager Jose Mourinho said: 'I told John Terry in the dressing room that he made fantastic performances with me in six years but for me this was the best I have seen from him. 'It was the best JT has ever played. His defensive performance was absolutely amazing.' This season, Terry has played 2,970 minutes, scoring three goals along the way as Chelsea sit at the Premier League's summit, 10 points clear of second-placed Manchester City having already collected the Capital One Cup in March. The 34-year-old celebrates with the Capital One Cup after Chelsea's 2-0 victory against Tottenham in March.

{"document":"David Cameron will launch a multi-billion pound sale of Lloyds Bank shares if he wins the Election \u2013 in what would be the largest privatisation bonanza since the Thatcher era. The Prime Minister will today pledge that if he is returned to Downing Street he will offer the public \u00a34 billion of Lloyds shares still held by the Government after Gordon Brown\u2019s \u00a320 billion panic bailout with taxpayers\u2019 money during the 2008 economic crisis. Individuals will be allowed to buy up to \u00a310,000 worth of Lloyds Banking Group shares, which were worth 78.7p when the stock market closed on Friday \u2013 comfortably above the 73.6p paid by Mr Brown\u2019s government. Scroll down for video. David Cameron will launch a multi-billion pound sale of Lloyds Bank shares if he wins the Election. The shares will be offered at a discount of at least 5 per cent on the market rate at the time, with the proceeds used to help pay down the national debt. It is the latest \u2018retro\u2019 Conservative policy to hark back to the 1980s, following Mr Cameron\u2019s revival in the manifesto of the Thatcherite \u2018Right to Buy\u2019 offer for housing association tenants. But while investors 30 years ago took overnight profits on their stakes in privatised companies such as British Gas and British Telecom \u2013 leading critics to claim that it encouraged \u2018carpetbaggers\u2019 \u2013 Lloyds shareholders will be encouraged to hang on to their holding. A loyalty bonus will be offered of one free share for every ten held for at least a year after the sale, up to a maximum bonus value of \u00a3200. The sale of Lloyds shares would be the biggest privatisation since the 1980s when Mrs Thatcher\u2019s government sold \u00a33.9 billion of BT shares and \u00a35.6 billion of British Gas shares in the famous \u2018Tell Sid\u2019 campaign. Thirty-three major companies were privatised under Mrs Thatcher between 1984 and 1991, which supporters said led to a dramatic improvement in their efficiency and a boost to tax revenues for the Treasury. Like Right to Buy, it also helped to entrench Tory support among voters who benefited from the windfalls. No 10 strategists hope Mr Cameron\u2019s pledge will remind voters of the economic problems that blighted the country under Mr Brown\u2019s premiership. The recovery under Chancellor George Osborne has allowed him to sell \u00a39 billion of shares in Lloyds to City investors for more than the price that former chancellor Alistair Darling paid in 2008. CLAIM: Jesse Norman and the chocolate cake he allegedly gave out while campaigning for re-election. Police are investigating a Tory MP over claims he attempted to bribe voters with chocolate cake. Jesse Norman allegedly gave out cake while campaigning for re-election at an Asda supermarket in his Hereford constituency. West Mercia Police last night said it was investigating reports of a breach of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which bans Election candidates from providing food, drink or entertainment in a bid to win votes. The probe follows would-be Ukip MP Kim Rose, who is standing in Southampton Itchen, being grilled by police for giving out sausage rolls at a party event earlier this year. Detectives are expected to speak to Mr Norman after he was photographed with trays of baked goods on April 2. He described the allegations as \u2018nonsense\u2019, saying: \u2018We had a couple of small boxes of chocolate muffins ... we may have given out one or two to children, who are not even voters.\u2019 There have been two sales to big pension funds and City institutions in 2013 and early in 2014. Late last year, UK Financial Investments, the Treasury body that manages the Government stake, hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to sell a few million Lloyds shares in the market every day over a six month period \u2013 a practice known as a \u2018dribble-out\u2019. The Government still owns \u00a312.5 billion of Lloyds shares and experts expect \u00a34 billion worth to be offered to the public, with the rest sold to City institutions. With the share price currently above 78p, the Tories will be able claim they have banked a profit running into billions for the taxpayer. However, while Lloyds has been a success story, the Government\u2019s other big bank investment \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 has not. The Treasury under Mr Brown paid an average of 502p a share for RBS when it was rescued. They were changing hands on Friday for 349p. In Mr Cameron\u2019s announcement today, he is expected to say: \u2018The \u00a320 billion bailout of Lloyds Bank by the last Labour government became a symbol of the crisis that engulfed the British economy under Labour. After the public bailed it out, people feared they wouldn\u2019t see their money returned. Today they are. \u2018Today\u2019s announcement marks another step in the long journey we have been making repairing our banks, turning our economy around and reducing our national debt, only made possible by our long-term economic plan. \u2018That\u2019s why it is so important that we don\u2019t put all that progress at risk, but instead build on what we\u2019ve done so we can deliver a brighter, more secure future for our country.\u2019 COUNTRY LIFE: A 'beater' at work and below, \u00a0a bottle of Sipsmith Dry Gin. The Prime Minister indulged his love of country sports by taking part in a secret country shoot near his Oxfordshire constituency home. And he celebrated with a nip of a specially prepared \u2018Chipping Norton\u2019 cocktail. But witnesses say that David Cameron did not himself use a gun \u2013 despite his reputation as a skilled marksman. Instead, he acted as a \u2018beater\u2019 to flush out the game. The event took place on New Year\u2019s Eve but until now has been kept a closely guarded secret. It took place near Chipping Norton, the Oxfordshire town which has given its name to the \u2018Chipping Norton set\u2019 of high-profile local residents from the world of politics, media and showbusiness such as Mr Cameron and Jeremy Clarkson. Last night, the man who served Mr Cameron the cocktail said other people on what he described as a \u2018country walk\u2019 had no idea there would be a VIP guest. Jared Brown, master distiller at the West London \u2018artisanal\u2019 gin company Sipsmith, said: \u2018No one but the landowner knew the Prime Minister would be joining us.\u2019 He fought shy of describing the event as a shoot, but added: \u2018I can say with utter certainty that Mr Cameron did not handle a gun.\u2019 Mr Brown confirmed, though, that the PM did sample the cocktail, based on Sipsmith London Dry Gin. Last night, the drink, also containing manuka honey, raspberry tea and extract of echinacea, was being dubbed the \u2018Chipping Norton cocktail\u2019.\n","right_summary":"David Cameron will pledge to sell Lloyds shares if he wins the election.

{"document":"When you consider 80 per cent of our information about the outside world comes through our eyes, it's hardly surprising studies show eye contact to be the most effective way to signal sexual interest. Eighteen times more sensitive than our ears, our eyes are capable of responding to one and a half million simultaneous messages. So finely tuned, they'll subconsciously spot when someone starts looking at us - even if we haven't noticed - and start taking mental notes. Scroll down for video. Tracey Cox says that it takes more than just simple eye contact to get someone's attention here she gives her advice on how to use your peepers to get someone's attention. If that person is checking everyone out, they'll stop registering the information; if it's just us they're interested in, they'll signal the brain to give us a nudge that someone's watching. Spring is the season for flirting so the perfect time to find out the five eye contact techniques that are scientifically proven to get you noticed! THE FOUR-AND-HALF SECOND SCAN. A normal face scan lasts three seconds, scan for four-and-a-half and it's clear someone has 'caught your eye'. Eye contact of more than ten seconds between two people means one of two things: you're about to fight or have sex (well, you want to anyway). Prolonged eye contact produces intense emotional reactions regardless of whether it's a fist or a pair of lips heading your way. It activates the nervous system, raises our heart rate and blood flow and stimulates the production of certain hormones. On average we scan a face for three seconds, scan for four and a half to register your interest. THE SLIDE AND SETTLE. Studies have shown this to be an almost foolproof way to find out if a stranger is interested in you. Let your eyes settle on someone so they're aware you've noticed them, then as they're still watching you, slide your eyes around the room before settling back on them again. This effectively says, 'You instantly attracted me and you're still the pick of the room even after I've checked out the competition.' If they're interested, most people drop their eyes straight down, then directly up again to lock eyes after a few seconds. If someone's eyes instead slide away from yours and don't return after a minute or two, they're almost definitely not interested. Tracey says the simple act of blinking can also make someone aware that you're attracted to them. It's a quick movement - the whole thing's over in ten to 15 seconds \u2013 but it's impressively accurate. THE FLIRTING TRIANGLE. Eye movement studies show we look at different parts of other people's faces depending on the situation and level of attractiveness. When looking at strangers or in business situations, we make a small triangle by moving our eyes from eye to eye, dipping them as we move across the bridge of the nose. With friends, the triangle widens as our eyes drop below eye level to include the nose and the mouth. With lovers and people we fancy, the triangle broadens even further, dropping below the mouth to include the breasts and other good bits like the genitals. As flirting becomes more intense, eye to eye contact becomes fast, furious and constant, seconded by long periods spent staring at the mouth. Our eyes spend the rest of the time making little side journeys to the bits at the bottom of the triangle. THE BLINK. It's easy to see where the term 'batting your eyelashes' originated from: if someone looks at us and likes what they see, they tend to blink more. Because the brain associates rapid blinking with finding someone sexually attractive, the more you blink at someone, the more attracted you feel to them. The function of blinking is to clean the eye and keep the moisture level constant. As intense emotion almost always produces tears, it stands to reason our blink rate increases when we're incredibly happy, sad, attracted or excited as the eye tries to clear excess liquid. THE LOVER'S GAZE. Staring directly into someone's eyes triggers an arousal reaction. Sadly, this doesn't mean you boring a hole into Poldark's smouldering brown pair will guarantee he'll gallop you off into the sunset. How the arousal develops depends on who is staring at who. If it's an unattractive stranger, it will turn into a fear response. But if you like the look of the person looking at you, the brain interprets it as a sexual signal and responds by getting your body ready for sex.

{"document":"Kim Richards was arrested early Thursday morning after allegedly attacking a police officer. Law enforcement were called  to The Beverly Hills Hotel at approximately 1:30am where the 50-year-old reality star was hanging out at the Polo Lounge. Radar reports that at some point after midnight the mother-of-four was refused service by a bartender after she'd had a few too many vodka tonics. The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star then became very angry and reportedly shouted 'Don't you know who I am?' Scroll down for video. In jail: Kim Richards was arrested on Thursday morning after becoming belligerent while intoxicated at the Polo Lounge in The Beverly Hills Hotel. Kim - who has struggled with substance abuse in the past - then headed to a bathroom and refused to come out \u00a0- which was when cops were called. A source told the website: 'She eventually locked herself in a bathroom and was refusing to come out and causing a scene. Cops had to be called at that point.' According to Beverly Hills Police Department spokesman Lt. Lincoln Hoshino, Kim appeared 'belligerent with slurred speech and wreaking of a strong odor of alcohol.' Kim allegedly cursed at officers and 'passively resisted arrest,' Hoshino said. Where is went down: After drinking vodka tonics all night a bartender at The Polo Lounge refused to serve the former child star and she then became angry saying 'Don't you know who I am?' Taking a turn for the worse: After resisting arrest Kim - who apparently smelled strongly of booze - was eventually booked into a local jail where she kicked a police officer. TMZ\u00a0reports the reality star had to be dragged out of the restrooms and taken to a nearby jail where she kicked a police officer. The reality star was issued a citation for trespass, resisting arrest, battery on a police officer and drunk in public and was later released on $20,000 bail at around 10:30am in the morning. She is due to appear at the Los Angeles Superior Court on May 10. Sources close to Kim's family tell People that they are heartbroken at the star's behaviour which has become more erratic in recent months. 'It will never get better. \u2026 She's been a mess, showing up late to events and social gatherings and acting bizarre or belligerent or both.' 'They of course love [Kim] and want to help, but no one can talk any sense into her because she is so out of it.' Really friends? Kim's supposed BFF Brandi Glanville took to her Twitter shortly after hearing the arrest news. Cast support: Kim's RHOBH cast mate Lisa Rinna tweeted her support despite questioning Kim's sobriety throughout the latest season. Empathy: Eileen Davidson also shared her reaction on Twitter shortly after news of Kim's arrest. The news may be unsurprising for some of her loved ones, however, as Us Weekly reported that she has been treating friends and family members terribly as a source said: 'Kim has been on the outs from her family recently. 'Things are so bad that nobody can deal with her. You can\u2019t even talk to her for two seconds -- she turns horrible to everybody.' This type of reported behaviour is so alarming that some experts believe it would be best for Bravo to dismiss the television personality from the reality programme according to People. 'This is one of those moments when her painfully public problem can become a personally promising opportunity to turn her life around,' said William C. Moyers from the Hazelden Betty For Foundation, 'But only if she takes seriously the reality of what's happened, by stepping away from the limelight and instead putting her attention on the help she needs and deserves to get better.' 'There is nothing funny or appealing about the reality of Kim's situation,' the expert added. 'She owes it to herself to step away from the limelight to get help. Her costars and Bravo should encourage Kim to take the first step or next step to recover.' Her on-screen group: Kim's sobriety was a major plot point during the fifth season of the hit reality series (pictured at the reunion in February) All talk? In Tuesday night's finale reunion show Kim was adamant that she is not struggling with her sobriety. During an episode of RHOBH in January, Kim maintained 'I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs \u2026 I don't have anything to hide,' after being asked outright if she was still sober. On Tuesday's finale reunion episode of RHOBH, the former actress was defiant that everyone stop discussing her sobriety - insisting that when she popped a pill at Eileen's poker party it was a one-off under extraordinary circumstances. 'I took a pill for a chronic pain that I was having. Did I take somebody else's pill? Yes. Was that right? No.' Kim explained of taking a pill from ex-husband Monty, who has been battling cancer. Kim continued: 'Let's get this straight real quick - I am not struggling with my sobriety, nor have I struggled with my sobriety,' she said. After questioning where anyone had any real concern for her, she again insisted: 'I am sober. I have been sober for three years. I don't appreciate all the conversations that have been behind my back. And I do not have to defend myself any longer.' Defiant: Kim told her co-stars 'I am sober. I have been sober for three years and I do not have to defend myself any longer.' Family tension: The reality star also came to blows with her sister Kyle (pictured in red) during the hour-long show with Bravo's Andy Cohen. Co-star Lisa Rinna shot back 'Well Kim I'm just going to say - you showed up at my house and you were higher than a kite,' which further infuriated Kim who stressed that she had been open about that one occasion.' Kim's RHOBH cast mates expressed their reaction to their friend's arrest on their Twitter pages. 'I was sad to hear about Kim\u2019s incident and I wish her and her family the best,' Rinna tweeted. 'I feel badly for Kim Richards and her family my thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time,' said Eileen Davidson. And BFF Brandi Glanville wrote: 'Wanted to say thank you to @KimRichards11 for donating to our school auction in the middle of all she has going on! so proud of her. 'Real friends are their in the good times,the bad times &especially the worst times.I am blessed with real friends & am a real friend myself.' Another one under her belt: Season five came to an end with part three of the reunion show which aired on Tuesday. Kim voluntarily entered rehab for alcohol addiction in December 2011  for the third time for and has been trying to stay sober ever since. In January 2012, Kim told Bravo's Andy Cohen in her first TV interview since her rehab stay: 'I'm an alcoholic. I had so much guilt and shame for my behavior... then I drank to cover the guilt and shame to make it go away.' In a separate sit down interview, Kim said, 'I'm getting reconnected with my kids, and that's been a huge thing for me. It's not what I expected when I came home. I was like, \"Hey! I'm home! Let's all get back exactly where we were!\" And they were like, \"Ummm, life is a little different now.\" So it was like a little bit of a challenge when I got home, which I didn't expect.' She has four adult children, daughters Brooke Brinson, Whitney Davis and Kimberly Jackson, plus one son, Chad Davis. Her brood: Kim has four adult children, daughters Brooke Brinson, Whitney Davis and Kimberly Jackson and son Chad Davis. Famous: Here, Kim was in Different Strokes.

In a statement late Wednesday, White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said the administration supports banning so-called conversion therapy treatments for minors. 'We share your concern about its potentially devastating effects on the lives of transgender as well as gay, lesbian, bisexual and queer youth,' Jarrett said. 'The overwhelming scientific evidence demonstrates that conversion therapy, especially when it is practiced on young people, is neither medically nor ethically appropriate and can cause substantial harm.' The White House is not explicitly calling for Congressional legislation to ban the therapies nationwide. But Jarrett's statement highlighted states that have outlawed the practice and expressed hope that there will be broader action. The White House says lawmakers in 18 states have introduced legislation similar to measures already in place in California, New Jersey and Washington, D.C. The laws ban licensed professionals from using conversion therapy on minors. The American Psychiatric Association has long opposed conversion therapy, which the organization says is based on the assumption that homosexuality is a mental disorder. Suicide: Leelah Alcorn's (pictured)\u00a0death spurred the White House petition with many signatures. Alcorn, the Ohio teen whose death spurred the White House petition, had gained an online following through her\u00a0Tumblr posts. She wrote about depression and isolation, lamented that her life would only get worse, and expressed frustration that her parents wanted her to be 'their perfect little straight Christian boy.' She said she was taken to 'Christian therapists' who were 'very biased.' Mara Keisling, the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, welcomed Obama's statement. 'Having President Obama and the weight of the White House behind efforts to ban conversion therapy is so critical in the fight for transgender and LGB young people,' Keisling said in a statement. 'My hope is that when a transgender person's struggle is acknowledged by one of the most recognizable figures in the world, it positively changes the way they view themselves. The pseudo-science that propels conversion therapy cannot match the self-acceptance that comes with this kind of change'\n","right_summary":"President Barack Obama is calling for an end to psychiatric therapy treatments aimed at turning gays into heterosexuals.

{"document":"A teenage boy who shot and killed a teacher and wounded several others in an attack inside a school in Barcelona had a 'hit list', local media reports. The 13-year-old boy is said to have listed 25 names of teachers and pupils he intended to kill and had told classmates of his plans as recent as last week, but none had taken him seriously. The teenager reportedly walked into the school armed with a machete and crossbow around 9.15am this morning, killing a male teacher and injuring two students and two teachers. Scroll down for video. Distressed relatives of students wait outside the Barcelona high school where a 13-year-old boy allegedly shot and killed a teacher using a crossbow, and injuring four people. Students reunite with their families as others wait for news outside the high school in Barcelona as it is claimed that the teenage attacker had told classmates he was planning to 'kill all the teachers' Two young girls comfort each other as students and staff were allowed to leave the school this afternoon. The teenager is said to have launched the attack in his own classroom, targeting his female Catalan teacher and her daughter, also a student at the school, Spanish media reports. According to a witness, the boy had been late for class and shot and injured the female teacher in the face, before stabbing her 13-year-old daughter. Student Gemma Jarque said she and her classmates barricaded themselves into their classroom when they heard the attack. 'We were just starting the class and suddenly we heard screams... so we shut ourselves inside our classroom in order to be safe', she said. 'We saw the teacher lying on the floor in a pool of blood.' Another student, Paula Amayuelas, said the boy had been bullied before in school. She said he 'didn't have problems but he was kind of a loner .... Other students would pick on him.' The boy is undergoing a psychiatric examination will not face criminal charges because he is under 14, the age of criminal responsibility in Spain. The victim, a male substitute teacher, had come to the aid of the woman and her daughter after hearing their screams and was shot and killed as he attempted to protect them,\u00a0El Pais\u00a0reports. The week before the attack, the teen had told classmates 'several times', that he was going to kill all the teachers before committing suicide, but none took him seriously and wrote it off as a bad joke. The boy, only identified by his initials M.P.C., had also said it would be easy to carry out an attack in the school with 'good weapons.' Judicial staff members take out the body of a teacher allegedly killed by a student armed with a crossbow at the Instituto Joan Foster  in Barcelona, Spain. Horror: Emergency Service members accompany two women out of the Joan Fuster Institue in Barcelona as it emerged that the teenage attacker had a 'kill list' A visibly distressed man, believed to be a member of staff, is helped out of the school. Aftermath: Students and parents leave the Joan Fuster Institute in a bus in Barcelona while police hold the suspect in the school. Following his detention after the slaughter, the boy was taken to a hospital for a psychiatric examination, said Jose Miguel Company, a spokesman for the Barcelona prosecutor's office. 'He was very disturbed and saying strange and incoherent things,' said Company, who added that the examination is aimed at determining whether the boy has psychiatric problems or whether he was faking them. The knife and crossbow used in the attack are believed to belong to the boy's father, who is reported to have kept a collection of weapons at home. His sister, also a pupil at the school, is reported to have fainted when she discovered what had happened. A friend of the sister of the alleged killer, who has not been named, said: 'She is a lovely person but he did strange things.' The female teacher attacked only suffered superficial wounds and her daughter is being treated in hospital with minor injuries. Another victim, a 14-year-old boy, was stabbed in the chest, but is now in stable condition in hospital, El Pais reports. Barcelona police said the boy has been arrested but would not confirm the weapon used in the attack. The attack took place in the Sant Andreu neighborhood of the city just after 9am, and the boy was detained shortly afterwards. The regional Mosses d'Esquadra police force are understood to be holding him at his school this morning on the orders of a judge so he could be examined by experts. Attack: The 13-year-old boy reportedly burst into the school armed with a knife and crossbow, killing a male teacher and injuring four others. Shocking: The attack took place just after 9am this morning and police confirmed the boy has been detained. Although he was earlier reported to have fired an arrow at the injured female teacher, sources later said he used the tip of the crossbow to stab her in the head and a leg. The school caretaker is understood to have wrestled him to the ground and disarmed him. Mossos d'Esquadra said in a statement: 'We have identified a minor on suspicion of the death of a teacher at a school in Barcelona. 'The incident happened inside the school about 9.15am when the minor allegedly attacked the teacher with a sharp object. 'During the incident four people were slightly injured, two female teachers and two pupils. 'Three of them have been transferred to hospital and one of them, a female teacher, was treated at the scene. Police are investigating the incident.' The attack took place on the 16th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre when seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold shot and killed 12 students and one teacher. The 1999 massacre in Columbine, Colorado, is the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history. A spokesman for regional police said it was too early to determine whether Monday's attack was an attempt to copy the Columbine attack.\n","right_summary":"Boy, 13, arrested after deadly attack at secondary school in Barcelona.

{"document":"From banking to hospitality and real estate to e-commerce, Ashish Thakkar built his vast business empire from scratch. The Ugandan tycoon started small with a little computer shop that kept him busy after leaving school at 15. These days, his Mara Group spans over 20 countries and he's been called \"Africa's youngest billionaire.\" In late 2013 Thakkar joined forces with the former boss of Barclays bank -- Bob Diamond -- to start an investment fund focused on Africa called Atlas Mara. The powerful duo raised $325 million through a share flotation - well above the $250 million target. But his vision spans beyond Africa, and Earth -- Thakkar was the first African to sign up for the opportunity to travel to space with Richard Branson's company, Virgin Galactic. CNN's Marketplace Africa spoke to Thakkar about African innovation, entrepreneurship and collaboration. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN:  You are active in several African countries. How is the current business landscape on the continent? Ashish Thakkar: Right now in the last 18 years I have been active on the continent, I have never seen so much global excitement around Africa that I've seen today. The climate and the ease of doing business on the continent has drastically improved. Unfortunately, it's one of those cases where perception is so different from reality. The reality on the ground is so much better than the perception. You've got to remember, as Africa, we are 54 countries. Some of the countries may be challenging and may have issues, but that cannot be an excuse to generalize the entire continent which is unfortunately something that happens quite a bit. CNN: Why do you think that entrepreneurs are so important to the future growth of the African continent? AT: We have a very young demographic -- 85% of our populations are under the age of 35. We have an extremely entrepreneurial society and culture. Yet, entrepreneurship is not in the education system. Where do our entrepreneurs go for advice and the right guidance? And it's something, frankly, that I am extremely passionate about, because the answer to unemployment is not foreign direct investment or large scale manufacturing plants, etc. It's going to be nurturing small and medium enterprises. So, it's great to see that there is a real entrepreneurial vibe coming into the system, and innovation is totally embedded into that. CNN: What is it about Africa that encourages innovation? AT: The biggest advantage we have at the moment, and you've seen this with mobile phone penetration, is that we don't have legacy systems. We didn't have landlines and we didn't need them. We didn't have to go through that hassle of creating landlines everywhere. We leapfrogged straight into mobile telephony. Today, we have over 750 million phones on the continent -- more than North America and Western Europe put together. We can actually leapfrog in so many different ways. Mobile money is another brilliant example. Mobile money was created in Kenya. The whole concept of having money on your phone, which is the best thing because it's secure, it's practical, made more sense. So, these kind of innovations, you're going to see a lot more of on the continent. I spend a lot of time with young entrepreneurs when I travel across the continent, and just seeing the kind of innovation and new ideas and concepts that they're coming up with is just so inspiring. CNN: What advice would you give to a young entrepreneur who's just starting out? AT: Entrepreneurship is a journey, it's not a destination. There are going to be so many challenges, you are going to get knocked down so many times, but you've got to get up, dust yourself off and get back to it. The persistence, the passion, and staying on course is very crucial. You'll be tempted to cut corners, you'll be tempted to do things that get you there quicker, but it never lasts. People say the youth are the leaders of tomorrow - we're not. We're the leaders of today, but it's our responsibility to take the seat at the table. CNN: What needs to be done most urgently to grow African economies? AT: Pan-African collaboration is extremely important. I think things like regional integration, inter-African trade does need to increase and is increasing. I mean, the progress in the East African community has been amazing. The manner in which they've harmonized so many different laws and policies and mindset and priorities within that region has been fantastic. So, we need to see more of that take place on the continent. The fact that we're 54 countries, yet we're a billion people is an advantage and a disadvantage. I think to strengthen our weakness in that collaboration across the continent is crucial. CNN: Are you confident about the future of the continent? AT: I am so bullish and so proud of how the continent has evolved in terms of leadership, the mindset of our leaders. It is so inspiring to see that. It's unfortunate that, you know, globally the highlight remains things like Ebola...The little issues that we do have are just magnified, yet on the broad scale we are doing so amazing. CNN: Is this Africa's century? AT: Mara's logo is the African Lion and our little joke, which a lot of people don't appreciate, hence I love it even more, is that the Indian Tiger and the Chinese Dragon have had their days and it's now the African Lion's turn. And it genuinely is -- this is our turn. More from Marketplace Africa. Read this: Africa's green lean speed machines. Read this: Family ties mixed with fresh fruit on island paradise.

{"document":"Wayne Rooney and his England team-mates were upset by the sloppy, uninspired way they started in Italy on Tuesday night. Nine months on from meeting at the World Cup, the Three Lions faced the Azzurri once more in a glamour friendly at the Juventus Stadium. Hopes were high after seven straight wins but Roy Hodgson's men struggled in the first half, deservedly falling behind to a Graziano Pelle header in Turin. England captain Wayne Rooney issues instructions during the 1-1 draw against Italy on Tuesday night. Rooney said he and the rest of the England players were upset by their first half performance. However, half-time brought with it renewed enthusiasm and England dominated the second period, levelling in style through Andros Townsend and going close to turning a 1-1 into an away triumph. 'We have (moved on from the World Cup) and I think that's why we were so disappointed with the first half,' England skipper Rooney said. 'We know we're better than that. Even though we had a lot of changes, we know we are a better team than what we showed first half. 'We were upset, I'll be honest, in the dressing room after the first half. Everyone was upset with the way we performed. Rooney and the rest of the England squad arrived back from Italy on Wednesday after their flight was delayed. The squad were supposed to fly home on Tuesday night after the match but a technical fault caused delay. 'It showed great character from everyone to go out in the second half to put in the performance we did, to get back in the game and were unlucky not to go on and win it. 'Italy are a great team and I think one of their biggest strengths is seeing the game out. 'We worked hard, we pushed the ball well, showed a lot of composure on the ball and created chances. 'On another night we might have scored another goal, but I think overall probably a draw for both teams was a fair result in the way the game went.' Graziano Pelle opened the scoring as England deservedly went behind in the first half against Italy. Andros Townsend equalised for Roy Hodgson's side during a much-improved second period. Things certainly ended positively for England, with Rooney dovetailing well with full debutant Harry Kane as Hodgson's second-half introductions stated their case. Ross Barkley was one of the stand-out performers, with the second-half substitute showing flashes of the form which impressed so many last summer. 'Ross is a terrific player,' Rooney said. 'He is a terrific young player and I think he can have an impact when he comes on. 'He did that, he took the ball, he ran at the Italian defenders and made it difficult for them. 'Hopefully, he can kick on now for the rest of the season.'\n","right_summary":"England drew 1-1 against Italy in friendly at Juventus Stadium on Tuesday.

{"document":"A gay couple getting married this summer had their wedding plans featured on Hillary Clinton's announcement that she is joining the race for the White House. Democrat campaigners Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson, from Chicago, Illinois, claimed they were surprised to find out that their same-sex wedding plans were featured on Sunday's video announcing Clinton's 2016 bid. The pair were seen walking hand in hand in what quickly became one of the most widely viewed political clips of the year. Milrad's voice is heard in a voiceover saying: 'I\u2019m getting married this summer to someone I really care about.' Scroll down for videos. Jared Milrad (pictured right) and his fianc\u00e9 Nate Johnson, who are campaigning Democrats, were featured in Hillary Clinton's video announcing her 2016 White House bid. The couple, who are planning a summer wedding, were featured walking hand in hand during Clinton's video to announce her 2016 bid for the White House. 'We were both out shopping, working on wedding invitations,' Milrad said of finding out about their new-found fame. He said he was overjoyed to be part of the Clinton rollout - and part of a large-scale change in U.S. social attitudes. 'It shows how far we've come,' said Milrad, 31-year-old lawyer and social activist, pleased that public support for same-sex marriage rights has grown so far as to appear in a presidential campaign launch. Mr Johnson, 30, is a project manager for a health care consulting company. The couple will get married in July in a Chicago park bordering Lake Michigan then have their reception at a LGBT community center, The Washington Blade\u00a0reported. The couple told The Blade that they would be making financial contributions to Clinton's campaign and would volunteer. Both have previously volunteered in presidential campaigns. Johnson supported Clinton in 2008 while Milrad worked for Obama in New Hampshire. The gay couple were only one in a diverse series of aspirational Americans featured in the Clinton ad, which casts a broad demographic net as she hunts for a winning coalition of voters. The video also featured Spanish-speaking brothers preparing to start a business, a mother seeking to return to the work force, an Asian-American college graduate and expectant African-American parents. 'Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion,' Clinton says on the video. 'So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote.' The vibrant clip, set to snappy music and featuring Clinton for less than half the video's length, is a dramatic departure from Clinton's drab announcement of seven years ago. The video which kicked off her former unsuccessful campaign showed Clinton on a couch, talking about ending the Iraq war, shrinking deficits and expanding affordable health care. Mr Milrad, who is the founder of social enterprise program the Civic Legal Corps, worked for Obama during the 2008 Democrat primaries in New Hampshire when the President was running against Clinton. Milrad, who is a lawyer and social campaigner, worked for Obama in New Hampshire during his 2008 White House bid. The couple pictured at the White House. They have been active campaigners in Democrat campaigns and plan to donate financially to Clinton's White House bid. It made no mention of same-sex unions. Barack Obama, the candidate who beat her to the White House, was personally opposed to gay marriage in 2008 and only recently converted to the cause. 'It's a sea change in progress that we see in our country,' Milrad said. Minutes after the Clinton announcement, Milrad took to Twitter to offer his endorsement -- and to invite Clinton to the upcoming Milrad-Johnson nuptials. 'We have not officially heard from Hillary,' admitted Johnson, a health consultant. 'We are going to extend an option of a plus-one for her. She'll probably want to bring someone.'\n","right_summary":"Democrat campaigners Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson, from Chicago, Illinois, had their summer wedding plans featured on Clinton's video.

{"document":"Tory election chiefs have given their candidates a letter-writing kit to target farmers, pensioners and women, leaked documents have revealed. A series of model letters have been drawn up with carefully pre-crafted messages designed to woo voters with just 28 days to go before the May 7 election. Women are told they are 'vital to the success of the British economy' while pensioners are praised for their 'wealth of experience'. A series of model letters have been drawn up with carefully pre-crafted messages designed to woo voters with just 28 days to go before the May 7 election. The letter-writing kit was revealed today as David Cameron made a campaign stop  at the National Grid Training Centre in Newark. Tory candidates are told to praise teachers as 'the best we have ever had' and tell farmers that they are 'vital' the party's economic plan, according to the leaked letter-writing guide. The letter templates are aimed at what party headquarters describes as 'target groups' in the electorate. Tory chiefs believe there are seven groups of voters who can be persuaded to change their vote in the run up to the election, including military veterans, pensioners, teachers and parents. The other groups Tory candidates are asked to target are women, young voters and farmers. There are also a number of letters 'written specifically for individual subjects', including defence, immigration and Europe. It advises activists: 'People are more likely to respond to a message from you if you write to them on an issue that they are directly interested in. 'This pack aims to provide you with pre-written examples you can use as the basis on which to write to people on issues that they raise.' The 37-page document, leaked to the Guardian, tells its candidates to tell women: 'Conservatives are committed to ensuring equal opportunities for men and women in all aspects of their lives. 'We are supporting women in work and providing greater financial security by reducing taxes, cutting the cost of childcare, addressing the gender pay gap and introducing shared parental leave.' Leaked documents reveal Tory election chiefs have given their candidates a letter-writing kit to target farmers, pensioners, women and other target voters - as well as advice on how to respond to questions about certain subjects. The letter templates are aimed at what party headquarters describes as 'target groups' in the electorate. The pack also says: 'Women are vital to the success of the British economy, and because our long-term economic plan is working, there are now more women in work and more women running their own business than ever before'. A pensioner who has raised an issue may receive a letter that says: 'Conservatives believe that if you have worked hard, saved, paid your taxes and done the right thing, you deserve dignity and financial security when you retire. 'We want a country where you get something for something, not something for nothing.' A Tory spokesman refused to comment about the letter-writing guide. But Labour MP Graham Jones said: 'This pack contains thousands of words but, as usual with the Tories, no answers. 'Rather than pumping out propaganda, what they should be doing is providing an explanation for their extreme plans, which would put the NHS at risk, and an answer as to whether they'll give millionaires yet another tax break.' Green Party activists have been told to dress in 'mainstream' fashion while knocking on doors in a bid to win over sceptical voters. A manual for the party's supporters urges them to appear 'level headed' and 'agreeable' \u2013 and even encourages them to compliment people's homes. The advice, which has been distributed among Green campaigners in London, also provides stock answers to ease voters' concerns about their radical plans to dismantle the army, legalise drugs and pay everybody \u00a372 a week no matter how rich they are. A Green campaigning manual urges activists to dress in 'mainstream' fashion - unlike the campaigners pictured with the party's only MP Caroline Lucas at a fracking protest at Balcombe, West Sussex (above) It comes amid growing scrutiny of the Green Party's manifesto commitments after its membership surged to more than 50,000, outnumbering the Liberal Democrats and Ukip. But the party's surge in support was hit by a series of disastrous media appearances from the party's leader Natalie Bennett in which she struggled to explain her key policies. In February she suffered what she called a 'brain fade' on LBC Radio when she forgot the details of her party's key housing policies. Ms Bennett endured another tough interview yesterday - and was forced to defend her proposal to give every adult in Britain a guaranteed weekly income. She admitted the so-called 'citizens income' \u2013 which critics say would cost \u00a3280billion \u2013 would take longer than five years to bring in, and could take even longer. Ms Bennett also admitted that another Green pledge \u2013 to dismantle the Armed Forces and use weapons factories to build wind turbines \u2013 was also a 'long-term aspiration'. The party also supports leaving Nato and abandoning nuclear weapons. The Green manual for volunteers aims to ease voters' concerns over the party's radical platform.\n","right_summary":"Series of model letters  drawn up with carefully pre-crafted messages.

{"document":"A man who has two failed marriages with Gambian women is hoping it will be third time lucky now that he is engaged to another woman he met in the country that he now calls home. David Tungate, 58, was left devastated after the marriage to his first Gambian wife broke down shortly after he brought her to the UK. He then remarried, but his second wife, also from Gambia, turned out to be a serial bigamist who conned him out of \u00a324,000 of his retirement money and left him close to bankruptcy. David Tungate with his fiancee Isatou Jarju. Determined not to let the experiences put him off, David is now dating a third Gambian woman and is convinced his latest lady will prove to be third time lucky. The former van driver said: 'I know people reading this might think I'm the most gullible man in Britain but I'm not bothered. 'I may have been left with nothing from the last Gambian woman I fell in love with, but my new girlfriend is different. 'She is wonderful and I feel blessed. It may be stupid but I always follow my heart.' David with his last wide Ndey, who was a bigamist. After divorcing his British wife of seven years in 1992, the father-of-two never imagined he would find love again. With the help of his sons from his first marriage, David slowly overcame the heartbreak and put his life back together. It wasn't until 1998 when he visited Gambia on holiday that he fell in love with Nyima Sye. Converting to Islam and marrying her that year, David brought his beautiful new wife back to the UK but five years later their marriage ended and the pair divorced. David said: 'Nyima was too young for me and eventually the cultural differences tore us apart. 'We split amicably but looking back now, she could have been after me for a British passport. I would never bring another Gambian woman over to the UK because of that.' David swore off women but 15 years later, everything changed when he joined a friend on another holiday to the West African country. Just a few days into his stay, David met Ndey, then 22, a waitress who could speak good English. Ndey in the town centre close to her home in Gambia. The pair started talking and after she explained she was recovering from Malaria and had lost her job in the restaurant, he offered to help. David started sending her \u00a350 a week and even paid a cafe owner to give his new love a job, bank rolling her wages of \u00a330 a week, unbeknownst to Ndey. Finally in June 2011 David had saved up enough money from his job as a van driver to fly back out to Gambia to be with his love. He said: 'I booked another two-week holiday and packed my suitcase full of clothes and jewellery for Ndey. 'I couldn't wait to start our relationship and when I got there and she met me at the airport, it was more than I had ever dreamed of. 'Leaving her to go back to the UK was heart breaking, I was already counting down the days until I could come back and see her.' In October 2012, 16 months later, David flew out to Bakau in Gambia with yet another suitcase of expensive gifts for his girlfriend. As well as securing a date for their wedding, David rented a flat out for her so they would have somewhere to stay whenever he returned to the country. In June 2013, the pair wed at Kanising Islamic Court in front of Ndey's sister and uncle - sadly none of David's family made the trip for the wedding. David with Ndey, who became pregnant with another man while they were married. Returning to see his wife as often as he could afford, David planned to stay living in the UK until he retired from his job as a newspaper delivery driver. In February 2014, Ndey asked him if he could pay the \u00a360 a month lease on a fashion shop she planned to open, which he agreed to do. Even though she became pregnant with another man's baby, David agreed to care for the child as if it were his won. On top of this, David paid \u00a32,000 up front on clothes stock and began working overtime to pay for everything. But in October 2014, he received a worrying text message from an unknown number which read: 'Your wife has married a Gambian man, is pregnant by him and living in his family compound in the town of Bakau.' David said: 'I was devastated. Through tears she admitted she had cheated on me while I was back in England. 'She said she was now four months pregnant with his baby.It was heart breaking but at the end of the day, she was my wife. I agreed to raise the baby as my own.' David bought maternity clothes and baby bits for Ndey and in November 2014 he moved to Gambia to live with his wife, but his happiness was short lived. Later that month he received another anonymous text saying: 'Your wife has three husbands, two white and one black.' In the final moments of their relationship, suspicious David hired a private investigator to unearth the truth about his beloved wife who kept disappearing for weeks on end. Within 48 hours they had tracked Ndey down and discovered she was living in a compound with an illegitimate husband and his family. David added: 'Words cannot explain how distraught I was. I couldn't believe she would do this to me, after everything I had done for her. My trust was completely shattered.' In January this year David contacted the police and Ndey was arrested and charged with bigamy and fraud. David with Ndey on the day of their wedding. She was fined 15000 Dalassi - ten years' salary - and will face two years in prison if she fails to pay by the end of April. Betrayed, David is now desperate to recover the \u00a324,000 he spent on Ndey over the last four years. He said: 'I refuse to divorce her until she pays me back every last penny. I have been left with nothing - no home in England, no pension, no savings, just \u00a345 a week to live on. 'I can't even move back to the UK because I can't afford it. 'As they say, love is blind. After all those years I finally found love, and it totally backfired. 'Our whole relationship was a lie, and I had no idea. The fact that she so willingly took my money as well is just heartless. The text David received telling him that his wife was pregnant with another man's baby. 'Looking back now, I should have seen the signs but I was a fool. A fair few people tried to warn me but I was having none of it. Gullible doesn't even cover it.' Despite everything he's been through, David is now dating Isatou Jarju, 30, a cafe owner who he met when Isatou was working in a cafe with Ndey. As Isatou's British husband had just left her, the pair bonded over their misfortune and although the relationship is still in the early stages, he says marriage 'isn't off the cards.' He said: 'She is different to Ndey and I can only hope it works this time. She seems trustworthy and never asks me for anything. 'She has her own business, home and is beautiful. Above everything, she makes me laugh and has brought a smile to my face while I've been dealing with everything. 'She is very special to me.' Not bothered by warnings from family and friends, David is hoping to prove them wrong with his third Gambian lover. He said: 'My loved ones who know what has happened are absolutely disgusted that she would treat me like this. 'They think I'm mad for dating another African lady but at the end of the day, they want me to be happy. 'Although I'm still angry and full of hatred for Ndey, I just feel so lucky that I can finally have my happy ending.'\n","right_summary":"David\u00a0Tungate, 58, from Norwich, is engaged to a 30 year old from Gambia.

Posters telling Muslims not to vote in the election were plastered across an area of Cardiff yesterday. They read: 'Democracy is a system whereby man violates the right of Allah.' Posters were stuck on lampposts and bus stops across the Grangetown suburb telling the Muslim electorate: 'Islam is the only real workable solution for the UK'. Cardiff Council have begun removing the posters, dubbed 'chilling' and 'threatening' by locals. The full message on the poster reads: 'Democracy is a system whereby man violates the right of Allah and decides what is permissible or impermissible for mankind, based solely on their whims and desires. 'This leads to a decayed and degraded society where crime and immorality becomes widespread and injustice becomes the norm. 'Islam is the only real, working solution for the UK. 'It is a comprehensive system of governance where the laws of Allah are implemented and justice is observed.' Local parent Greg Pycroft, 36, was with his two-year-old son when he came across 20 posters plastered on his walk to nursery yesterday. The Welsh Government worker  said: 'It was quite chilling and threatening to see these posters.' Cardiff Council says any religiously motivated or offensive stickers will be removed as a priority. Grangetown councillor Ashley Govier said: 'People have a right to vote and that needs to be respected. Grangetown is a very tolerant area but it's got to go both ways. 'If they do choose not to exercise their right to vote, that's their business but we're trying to encourage people to do so and this is unhelpful and not very nice.'

'We have been doing it every Friday for three months to encourage worshippers in an unpartisan way to participate in their civic duties. 'Most mosques were on board and the hateful people behind these posters do not represent us. 'The mosques believe they can be part of the political process of this country.'

{"document":"There was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that Rolling Stone retracted on Sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed: The University of Virginia is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus. The school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it. The Virginia attorney general asked the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students. That includes how UVA officials handled the allegations in the discredited Rolling Stone article by a student the magazine called \"Jackie,\" especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out. The alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012, and Jackie told the university about it the next spring. She started telling her story very publicly, including at a \"take back the night\" rally. But Charlottesville police didn't hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014, in which Jackie claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face. When a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault, she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident. In both cases, police said Jackie refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case. But more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as Jackie's. Rolling Stone's story opened up a conversation about the topic, and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims. Many women told CNN about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus. They'd call it a \"bad experience.\" Others told CNN that there were fraternities with reputations for being \"rapey\" and for using date-rape drugs. That some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman's outfit. And if a woman did report her rape, some women complained that the internal process didn't seem worth it if their abuser wouldn't be kicked out of school. Rolling Stone had a line in its original story: \"UVA's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998, 183 people have been expelled for honor-code violations such as cheating on exams. And yet paradoxically, not a single student at UVA has ever been expelled for sexual assault.\" After the article published, UVA admitted this and instituted a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined, so it's unclear what it means. When the story was deleted from Rolling Stone's website, that was lost. \"You lose a lot of other people's voices who were in that article,\" said Sarah Roderick, a survivor and UVA student, \"and a lot of good things that could have come about. Fixing problems with administration here and on our campus\" -- and, she added, across the nationo. Along with the O'Melveny & Myers investigation, there's also an open Title IX investigation into UVA by the U.S. Department of Education as a result of a civil suit. The attorney who filed the suit, James Marsh, told CNN that UVA medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he's representing, making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice. When the Columbia Journalism School's 12,000-plus-word critique is summed up, it really boils down to this: The mistake could have been avoided if the writer, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of Jackie who she claimed were with her that night. They'd later tell other media outlets, including CNN, that they remembered a very different story. Rolling Stone says their account would have been a red flag. And all three say they would have talked if they'd been called. Ryan Duffin, one of the trio, said he felt deceived by Jackie, but he also pointed out that Erdely's mistake in fact-checking was about one single incident, and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost. \"Had she gotten in direct contact with us, it probably wouldn't have been printed, at least in that way,\" he said. \"A lot of the article was still based in truth, but the focal point would have been different.\" It might have been less dramatic, but it would have probably focused on some of the other UVA students who shared much more common stories of acquaintance rape on campus. \"I think my problem with it was that this reporter wanted to sensationalize an experience that's not very common,\" Roderick said. \"... And I wonder if it would have been different if (it dealt) with someone with a less horrific story -- something that happens to more people. I think this discredits what a lot of survivors go through. Something this physically horrific is not what everyone goes through. Now it's like, 'If I wasn't assaulted by more than one man then my story is not as worthy of attention.' It's frustrating that this is how rape is portrayed on college campuses because this is not the norm.\" Before the report came out, Abraham Axler, the student body president, said that some good had come from the article because it forced UVA to institute new policies and to open up a conversation on a topic that needed to be discussed nationwide. But some survivors and advocates are afraid the retraction set back their progress. \"I do feel like there's a possibility people will be afraid to come forward. If you come forward and share your story, if you don't have the date right, every detail down, you'll think, 'I'm going to be accused of being a liar. It's easier for me to keep it to myself,'\" Roderick said. \"There are very serious and unresolved questions about the university's performance,\" said Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia School of Journalism. \"Rolling Stone teed that subject up. I wouldn't say that everything about Rolling Stone's treatment of that subject was perfect, but it certainly doesn't fall under the same category as their reporting about Jackie's narrative.\"\n","right_summary":"University of Virginia is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus.

{"document":"Ben Flower has been urged to be 'a bit more aggressive' when the prop sensationally sent off in last year's grand final returns for Wigan in Thursday's Super League derby with Warrington. The 28-year-old Welsh international forward on Tuesday completed his six-month ban for twice punching Lance Hohaia in the opening moments of October's Grand-Final at Old Trafford. Flower stunned the 76,000 crowd with his attack on the St Helens half-back and, after becoming the first player to be sent off in a Grand Final, was handed the second heaviest suspension in the history of Super League. Ben Flower's sickening blow on St Helens' Lance Hohaia in the Super League final that got him a six-month ban. Flower, here walking off after being shown a grand final red card, will return on Thursday against Warrington. Wigan coach Shaun Wane says he wants Flower back 'a bit more aggressive and a bit stronger and a bit fitter' St Helens possibly needed something out of the ordinary to help end an eight-year spell without a Grand Final title.\u00a0Ben Flower\u2019s two brutal punches on Lance Hohaia, which led to the dismissal of the Wigan prop inside two minutes, fit that description. CLICK HERE to read Martha Kelner's full Super League Grand Final report. Wigan coach Shaun Wane told a news conference at the DW Stadium on Tuesday that he will throw Flower straight back in, almost certainly from the bench, and expects him to be just as physical. 'I hope he's a bit more aggressive and a bit stronger and a bit fitter,' Wane said of Flower, who underwent knee surgery during his enforced lay-off. 'He's without a doubt one of the best front rowers in the comp and that's we want. We need a Ben Flower in our team. He's dynamic, just what I like, he runs the ball hard and he's uncompromising. He's perfect for me. Flower falls on Hohaia after first punching the New Zealand international to the ground. Referee Phil Bentham was given no choice but to make Flower the first player sent off in a grand final. 'I'll be telling him to go as hard as he can, run as hard as you can, hit as hard as you can and just carry on from where you left off because bear in mind in the play-off games last year he was one of the best. I want him back to that form as quickly as possible.' Flower, who was fined 50 per cent of his wages during his ban and has been coaching local juniors as part of the punishment handed out by his club, is ready to 'rip in', according to Wane. 'He's in a very, very good state of mind,' the coach said. 'He's very strong and he's trained really well. I can't wait to put him in. I'm really looking forward to it. I've been itching for this game to come and he'll get a chance. 'He just wants to get back to what he's paid to do, playing rugby and being one of the best middles in the competition. 'He's had a long pre-season and he's dying to rip in.' Flower's second punch (left) became the focal point of the all-in brawl which broke out in the first three minutes. A bloodied Hohaia is helped from the field - he received a one-match ban for the forearm that sparked the fight. Wane says Flower is in a 'very good state of mind' after a long enforced pre-season. Wane will bring Flower straight back into the Warriors line-up, almost certainly from the bench. Meanwhile, Wane has denied that Wigan are close to finalising the return of England full-back Sam Tomkins. The former Man of Steel has been granted a release from the last year of his three-year contract with New Zealand Warriors after becoming homesick and it is thought he is heading back to the Warriors, who retained first option on his services. 'He's one of the best players in the world and we're always interested in the best players but I've been told nothing,' Wane said. 'Unless I get a phone call today telling me anything different, I'm just cracking on preparing for Warrington and Wakefield.'\n","right_summary":"Ben Flower was suspended for six month after grand final red card.

{"document":"Saudi Arabia has been condemned for beheading an Indonesian domestic worker who was 'suffering from mental illness'. Her home country's leadership is furious that Siti Zainab's family was not notified before her execution this morning - and summoned Saudi Arabia's ambassador to complain about her death. While Amnesty International says her killing in the holy Islamic city of Media this morning 'smacks of a basic lack of humanity'. The domestic worker was sentenced to death in 1999 after confessing to stabbing her employer who allegedly mistreated her to death. She was on death row for over 15 years while Saudi Arabian authorities waited for the victim's youngest child to reach adulthood - to decide whether or not the family wanted to pardon Zainab or demand her execution. Executed: Indonesia and human rights groups are furious that Saudi Arabia executed domestic worker Siti Zainab without notifying the country's officials or her family. Indonesian President Joko Widodo and three of his predecessors had previously written to the Saudi king asking for the victim's family to forgive Zainab. But the sentence was carried out despite their claims that Zainab's family and officials were not given adequate notice or information before she was killed. Indonesia's foreign ministry released a statement saying:\u00a0'From the beginning, the government has struggled to provide her with assistance and has asked the family [of the victim] for forgiveness. 'The Indonesian government filed a protest against the Saudi Arabian government for not giving prior notification to Indonesian representatives or to the family over the execution date.' Riyadh's ambassador to Indonesia  was 'surprised' to be summoned by the foreign ministry but said he would follow up on Jakarta's concerns. Mustafa Ibrahim Al-Mubarak said: 'The problem is not about the court and the execution, it is about the date of the execution... I have to check what went wrong.' Before her arrest, Zainab sent two separate letters to her employer's son to say the woman she eventually killed had been cruel to her. The Indonesian government has issued a statement condemning Saudi Arabian authorities' failure to notify them and Zainab's family before executing her. Desperate plee: Indonesian President Joko Widodo had previously written to the Saudi king asking for the Saudi victim's family to forgive Zainab. A UN resolution has urged states not to execute or impose the death penalty 'on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder'. 'Imposing the death penalty and executing someone with a suspected mental illness smacks of a basic lack of humanity,' according to Amnestry International's Middle East and North Africa Programme Director. Philip Luther added: 'This practice has been widely condemned on the world stage and Saudi Arabia should take this opportunity to reconsider its stance on the death penalty.' She had no legal representation at any stage and did not have access to a consular representative during the police interrogation when she had made her 'confession', according to Amnesty. They claim the police knew she suffered from mental illness at the time of the interrogation. The charity's 2014 global report on the death penalty released earlier this month said Saudi Arabia once again ranks among the top five executioners in the world. So far in 2015, Saudi Arabia has executed at least 60 people, most of them by beheading which compares to 90 executions in the entirety of 2014. Philip Luther added: 'Whatever the misguided purpose behind Saudi Arabia's shocking spike in executions so far this year, it should draw international condemnation. 'The Kingdom's authorities must halt this execution spree and establish an official moratorium on the use of the death penalty.' Human rights groups are using Zainab's beheading to urge Indonesia to abandon its support for the death penalty as it presses ahead with plans to execute several foreigners on death row for drug crimes. But Jakarta remains determined to execute several drug traffickers - including citizens from Australia, France, Nigeria, Ghana, Brazil and the Philippines - as soon as possible.\n","right_summary":"Siti Zainab was executed in holy city of Medina after 15 years on death row.

{"document":"Google is facing a fine of up to \u00a34billion as Europe prepares to file a high-profile anti-competition lawsuit against the internet giant. The EU has been investigating the US search engine for five years following complaints that it abuses its dominance in the continent - but proceedings have stalled on three previous occasions. Now the European\u00a0Commission, the EU's top antitrust authority,\u00a0is asking companies who previously filed confidential complaints against Google for permission to publish them, so that officials can begin to build a case against the firm. If found to have been behaving unfairly, Google could be fined ten per cent of its annual revenues, which would be more than \u00a34 billion based on last year's performance. Facing huge fine:\u00a0Google is facing a fine of up to \u00a34billion as Europe prepares to file a high-profile anti-competition lawsuit against the internet giant. Shopping, comparison and travel companies are among those that have been contacted by the EU, The Wall Street Journal reports. US companies Microsoft and Trip Advisor are among those that have filed complaints against Google with the EU. A decision to file charges would kick start the EU's most prominent antitrust suit since its ten year-long campaign against Microsoft Corp. - the firm was forced to pay out more than a \u00a31billion in fines in 2012. The specific document the EU is said to be preparing is referred to as a Statement of Objections. Once filed, it's likely that a number of deeper investigations, counter-statements, and settlement discussions would ensue. If the search engine and the EU cannot come to an agreement, then fines could be issued and restrictions placed on Google's behavior. Leading investigation: New EU antitrust chief\u00a0Margrethe Vestager has suggested she favours pursuing legal action against Google over pushing for a settlement. The company would then have the right to appeal the case to the highest European court. Even if it is settled without a huge fine, antitrust cases can be hugely disruptive for firm, as Microsoft discovered. The European Commission has also been investigating whether Google has been 'scraping' content from rivals' sites, and placing unreasonable restrictions on advertisers and software developers who do business with them. A 'preliminary view' taken by the commission in March  2013 was that Google was abusing its dominant position in a number of areas. The company has denied any wrongdoing. Speaking in Berlin last week, Kent Walker, the company's Senior Vice President & General Counsel, highlighted the 'painfully long list of unsuccessful Google products', including Google+ and Street View in Germany, as proof that competition laws were serving their purpose. Long-running dispute: Former EU antitrust chief\u00a0Joaquin Almunia, above, made three unsuccessful attempts to resolve the dispute between Google and its European rivals. The EU's investigation of complaints that Google abuses its dominance of the online search market to hurt rivals began in 2010. The US company handles more than 90 per cent of Web searches in Europe - considerably higher than its share of the US market. Comparison-shopping sites claim that when consumers use Google to search for products online, Google positions results from Google Shopping prominently. The argument is that this\u00a0relegates products from rival sites to positions lower down the search page, where they might not be seen. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's new antitrust chief, has  suggested she will pursue legal action rather than seek a settlement. Google and Commissioner Vestager\u2019s predecessor, Joaquin Almunia, made three attempts to resolve the dispute, but in each case intense pressure by national governments, Internet rivals and privacy advocates scuppered the effort. The latest settlement proposed by Mr. Almunia fell apart following a series of interventions by powerful political players, including a letter from the economy ministers of France and Germany calling for greater concessions from Google, and protests from German publishing houses. In November the European Parliament passed a resolution calling for a possible breakup of Google, brushing aside an unusual series of objections from the US Congress that the move risked politicizing an antitrust investigation. Ms. Vestager met a month ago with Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman. Last week, she indicated that her priority was to ensure that smaller Internet firms could compete with the industry's giants.\n","right_summary":"EU has been investigating the US search giant's practises for five years. 3 previous attempts to settle matter have stalled due to political pressure. One complaint is that Google Search leads users on to the firm's own sites. Current case could result in Google being fined 10% of its annual revenues.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Google could face consequences for abusing its dominant position in Europe's search engine market.

{"document":"An elderly couple died of carbon monoxide poisoning after lighting a barbecue in their home to keep warm during a power cut, an inquest heard. Grandparents Patrick and Marianne Charles, 78 and 74, were without heating during a blackout on a cold November night last year. The couple, who had been married for 53 years, sat down in their conservatory in Eastbourne, East Sussex, with a glass of wine each and fired up the barbecue to heat up the room. An elderly couple died of carbon monoxide poisoning after lighting a barbecue in their home (pictured) to keep warm during a power cut, an inquest heard. The conservatory quickly filled with smoke and within minutes the couple were unconscious after choking on the fumes. They couple laid dead for 16 days before their son, Andrew Charles, raised the alarm on December 11 and police searched the property, Hastings Magistrates' Court heard. Maintenance work by UK Power Networks caused the power cut, the inquest was told. Mr Charles said his parents often went on holiday abroad and neighbours said the pair\u00a0'kept themselves to themselves', so it was not unusual for them to go weeks without contact. The son's statement to the hearing read: 'They loved their holidays, faithful friends and their grandchildren. They were happy and in love after 53 years of marriage.' East Sussex deputy coroner Christopher Wilkinson recorded a conclusion of accidental death. They couple laid dead at their home on Cedar Close, Eastbourne, for 16 days before their son found them. Carbon monoxide poisoning is often caused by people lighting barbecues inside tents, with campers warned not to use them in enclosed spaces. Official advice from Public Health England on carbon monoxide poisoning states: 'The potentially deadly gas, which you can\u2019t taste, smell or see, is produced when fossil fuels or wood burn without enough oxygen. 'Several campsite deaths have been linked to carbon monoxide poisoning from barbecues in recent years. The gas can build up quickly to potentially fatal levels in enclosed spaces such as tents or caravans.' Sheila Merril, public health adviser at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: 'Carbon monoxide (CO) is particularly dangerous because it has no colour, smell or taste. It is therefore easy to inhale without realising it. 'CO poisoning is caused by faulty or badly-serviced gas and other fossil fuel-burning appliances and systems. Barbecues should not be used indoors as this can lead to a build up of CO. 'To remain safe, families need to ensure that gas and fossil fuel appliances are serviced regularly and know the signs of CO poisoning, which include prolonged flu-like symptoms or coal or wood fires that burn slowly or go out.' Symptoms can include headaches, drowsiness and nausea, causing some victims to believe they have a minor illness, such as a cold or food poisioning, or are even just sleepy. However long exposure to the toxic fumes can have severe consequences, including unconsciousness and death.\n","right_summary":"Patrick and Marianne Charles lit the barbecue as their heating was cut off.

{"document":"Just a day after being released from jail, the man who was beaten by cops following a two-and-a-half hour chase on horseback has spoken out to detail his painful arrest. Helicopter cameras caught a swarm of cops kicking and punching 30-year-old Francis Pusok more than 80 times on Thursday, after he fled his southern California home when they tried to arrest him for identity theft charges. In an interview with NBC 4\u00a0on Monday,  Pusok revealed that he had been handcuffed for '99 per cent' of the beating and that near the end of the scarring experience a deputy whispered into his ear 'This isn't over'. Scroll down for video. Scarring experience: Francis Pusok (left) spoke for the first time on Monday, four days after he was beaten up by cops in footage taken from a helicopter. His girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner, pictured center. When San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies arrived at Pusok's house on Thursday, he said he  fled 'because any contact with police has been negative for me'. As the chase was coming to a close about two and a half hours later, video shows Pusok falling to the ground as he is hit with a taser and two deputies approach. The officers then start to assault Pusok, and later claimed that his taser had been ineffective due to his loose clothing - even though Pusok is clearly seen convulsing from the electric shock in the helicopter footage. On the run: Pusok fled his house in San Bernardino County on Thursday after Sheriff's deputies showed up to arrest him on identity theft charges. He led police on a more than two-hour long chase, part of it on horseback. On the ground: At the end of the chase, police officers shot Pusok with a taser and he fell to the ground. Pusok claims they handcuffed him within 15 seconds and then continued to beat him despite the fact he was lying helpless on the ground. Cruel: The helicopter continued to record the first two cops beating Pusok up as more deputies swooped in. Under investigation: In the aftermath of the disturbing video, 10 officers have been placed on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated. Pusok estimates that within 15 seconds of the first taser hit, the cops had him in handcuffs but says they continued to assault him and yelled 'stop resisting' even though he was laying face down on the ground. He says the officers went on to tase him two more times after he was in handcuffs. Pusok remembers the cops 'hitting me every place that they could hit me - anywhere and everywhere.' 'I thought I was being beaten to death,' said Pusok.. 'I was wondering, \"When is it going to stop?\"' Bruised: Pusok sports a painful black eye in his booking photo. He was released from jail on Sunday. After the incident, Pusok was arrested on suspicion of evading, stolen property, reckless driving and theft of a horse. He was treated for his injuries while being held at West Valley Detention Center where he was released Sunday night at bail. A court hearing has been scheduled for June 16, but San Bernardino County Prosecutors said Monday that they had not yet made a decision on whether to file formal charges against Pusok. Meanwhile, 10 officers - including a sergeant and a detective - involved in the incident have been placed on paid leave as the FBI starts an investigation into whether excessive force was used in the arrest. San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said last week that he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video and that an internal investigation is underway into  the deputies' actions. A criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out, he said. However, he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid. In his interview on Monday, Pusok said he thinks his prior run-ins with police may have sparked their violent backlash. Indeed, Pusok's lengthy criminal record includes charges of obstructing an officer and resisting an officer, as well as attempted robbery, animal cruelty and fighting or offensive words. Deputies have been\u00a0called\u00a0to Pusok's home before, during which he threatened to kill a deputy and shot a\u00a0puppy in front of his family, Sheriff McMhaon said. Disturbing: San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon says he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video and that he has launched an internal investigation. However, Pusok's pregnant girlfriend, Jolene Bindner, says some of the prior charges against her longtime partner have been trumped up. Bindner told NBC that the charges he threatened to kill a police officer are 'absolutely not true. I was there the whole time.' She also said that Pusok, father of their three children, was arrested in 2002 for driving at unsafe speed on a sidewalk but that he was only riding a bicycle at the time. What concerns Bindner the most though was the one deputy's alleged whispered threat of 'This isn't over' at the end of the beating. 'That concerns me because we have children together and I don't want any kind of retaliation against me or my children,' she said. Doing better: After visiting her longtime partner in jail on Sunday, Pusok's girlfriend Jolene Bindner said he was on the road to recovery. Threats: The couple share three children together and have another on the way. Bindner (left) says she is concerned about a deputy who whispered 'This is not over' to her boyfriend at the end of the beating. Pusok's attorney Jim Terrell said his client's criminal history has nothing to do with any possible excessive force case. 'If it wasn't for that helicopter and the camera...they would be charging him with 10 counts of battering a police officer,' Terrell said. 'That's how it rolls here, that's what goes on every single day.' Pusok's beating came as recent violent episodes by officers dealing with suspects have hit the headlines, including the killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend. Scott, 50, who was unarmed, was shot dead by 33-year-old Officer Michael Slageras he ran away from him during a traffic stop. Slageras has since been arrested and charged with murder. The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement saying it is 'deeply troubled by the video images' and applauding McMahon's call for an investigation.\n","right_summary":"Francis Pusok, 30, was arrested Thursday after a hours long chase with police in San Bernardino County, California.

{"document":"Hundreds of explorers, theorists and fantasists have spent their lives searching for the infamous 'big-foot'. But a leading geneticist believes he has found evidence to prove that it - or rather she - could have been more than a myth. Professor Bryan Sykes of the University of Oxford claims a towering woman named Zana who lived in 19th Century Russia - and appeared to be 'half human, half ape' - could have been the fabled yeti. Witnesses described the six-foot, six-inches tall woman discovered in the Caucasus mountains  between Georgia and Russia as having 'all the characteristics of a wild animal' - and covered in thick auburn hair. Scroll down for video. Historic: A leading genetecist claims a towering woman named Zana (artist's representation) who lived in 19th Century Russia - and appeared to be 'half human, half ape' - could have been the fabled yeti. Proof: DNA evidence from Zana's granddaughter (left) and the remains of her son Khwit (right) seemed proved that Zana was of African descent even though she lived in the wild Caucusus. Wild: Zana was discovered and trapped by a local merchant who hired a group of hunters to hunt her down in the region of Ochamchir - and she was eventually tamed by a nobleman on his estate in Tkhina. Treacherous: It is thought Zana roamed the remote Caucusus mountains, where Sykes says her African ancestors lived for many generations. Trapped: A merchant found Zana in the Ochamchir region of western Georgia and after hunters caught her, they placed her in a ditch surrounded by sharp spikes. Mythical: Witnesses described the six-foot, six-inches tall woman  as having 'all the characteristics of a wild animal' (fabled 'big-foot' pictured) Experts believe the wandering 'Wild Woman' was found lurking in the remote region of Ochamchir in the Republic of Abkhazia. She was captured by a local merchant in the 1850s who hired a group of hunters to subdue and shackle her in the mountainous terrain. Professor Sykes claims Zana was kept in a 'ditch surrounded by sharpened spikes' and sold from owner to owner until she came to serve nobleman Edgi Genaba as a servant. Famously known as the ape woman, Zana had at least four children by local men and some of her descendants still live in the region, the Times reported. Sykes made an astonishing discovery when he carried out saliva tests on six of her living relatives and the tooth of her deceased son Khwit. The DNA analysis revealed that they all contained the right amount of African DNA for Zana the ape woman to be '100 per cent African' but remarkably she did not resemble any known group. Discovery: Professor Bryan Sykes of the University of Oxford analysed the DNA of her living relatives in the Caucuses region and found west-African genes. Myth? The first accounts of the Yeti emerged before the 19th century from Buddhists who believed that the creature inhabited the Himalayas. Her resemblance was that of a wild beast - 'the most frightening feature of which was her expression which was pure animal,' one Russian zoologist wrote in 1996. The man who organised various eyewitness accounts of Zana wrote: 'Her athletic power was enormous. Evidence: In his book 'Nature of the Best', Sykes argues that Zana could be the yeti. She would outrun a horse and swim across the Moskva river even when it rose in violent high tide.' Some have argued that she was a runaway Ottoman slave but Professor Sykes says her 'unparalleled DNA' refutes that theory. He believes her ancestors came out of Africa over 100,000 years ago and lived in the remote Caucasus for many generations. Zana was eventually 'tamed' by the nobleman who bought her as a servant and kept her on his estate in Tkhina in the Republic of Abkhazia. Accounts from the time claim she was incredibly muscular, slept outdoors and ran around naked until she died on the estate in 1890. Some of his colleagues doubt his other findings - which include a claim that an unknown species of bear might account for yeti sightings in Bhutan. Despite the lack of hard proof from the analysis of the alleged 'yeti hairs', he says he has developed a strong sense that 'something is out there' after speaking to dozens of witnesses. Professor Sykes could not say if the yeti, bigfoot or the Russian almasty is the best candidate for a surviving race of human 'apemen'. He said: 'Bigfoot has many more people trying to find it. But I suppose either the yeti or the alma \/ almasty, which live in inaccessible and very thinly populated regions, is the most likely.' The first accounts of Yetis emerged before the 19th century from Buddhists who believed that the creature inhabited the Himalayas. They depicted the mysterious beast as having similarities to an ape and carrying a large stone as a weapon while making a whistling sound. In 1832, an explorer who had his account of trekking in Nepal published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal spoke of seeing tall, bipedal creature covered with long dark hair, which seemed to flee in fear. The term Abominable Snowman was developed in 1921 following a book by Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Howard-Bury called Mount Everest The Reconnaissance. Popular interest in creature gathered pace in early 20th century as tourists began making their own trips to the region to try and capture the Yeti. They reported seeing strange markings in the snow. Mystical: Hundreds of explorers, theorists and fantasists have spent their lives searching for the infamous 'big-foot' The Daily Mail led a trip called the the Snowman Expedition in 1954 to Everest. During the trip mountaineering leader John Angelo Jackson photographed ancient paintings of Yetis and large footprints in the snow. A number of hair samples were also found that were believed to have come from a Yeti scalp. British mountaineer Don Whillans claimed to have witnessed a creature when scaling Annapurna in 1970. He said that while searching for a campsite he heard some odd cries which his guide attributed to a Yeti's call. That night, he saw a dark shape moving near his camp. In recent times, there have been more reported Yeti sightings and at a conference in Russia in 2011, scientists declared they were 95 per cent certain of the existence of Yetis. In 2013, a scientist claimed that the Yeti was a distant relative of the polar bear, which is thought to have died out more than 40,000 years ago. But researchers have shown that the two hair samples analysed actually originated from a modern polar bear, and a type of rare bear native to the high mountain ranges.\n","right_summary":"Witnesses said Zana the apewoman had the 'characteristics\u00a0of a wild animal' She was allegedly trapped in Caucusus mountains and covered in thick hair.

{"document":"An experimental cancer drug axed over poor results may have the ability to reverse the effects of Alzheimer's, experts have revealed. The drug was developed by the British pharmaceutical giant Astra Zeneca with the original aim of treating certain types of tumour, but was shelved after it proved ineffective. Scientists at Yale University in Connecticut in the US have revealed how the treatment, called AZDO5030, restored memory in mice given Alzheimer's disease. An experimental cancer drug axed over poor results may have the ability to reverse the effects of Alzheimer's, experts have revealed (file picture) The drug worked by blocking a process that breaks nerve connections in the brain used to store memory. Researchers say the study has led to the launch of human trials to test the efficacy of the drug in Alzheimer's patients. Stephen Strittmatter, the author of the report, published in Annals of Neurology, said: 'With this treatment, cells under bombardment by beta amyloid plaques show restored synaptic connections and reduced inflammation, and the animal\u2019s memory, which was lost during the course of the disease, comes back. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health which launched a programme to test failed drugs on different diseases. Mr Strittmatter and his co-author Christopher van Dyck have already started a 'multi-site clinical trial' to determine whether the drug can also benefit Alzheimer's patients. According to the Alzheimer's Society, there are 850,000 people with dementia in Britain - a figure that includes 40,000 younger people. The charity estimates that 60,000 deaths are attributable to dementia every year and that there will be one million people with the disease in the UK by 2025. It reports that the financial cost of dementia to the UK is \u00a326billion a year. The Daily Express reports the charity's head of research Dr James Pickett as giving the latest treatment a cautious welcome. He said: 'Drug development can take decades, so repurposing pre-existing drugs for dementia is a promising avenue to find new treatments as they have been shown to be safe to use in people and can lead to clinical trials sooner. 'As we learn more about the causes of dementia, there is hope that treatments we routinely use for other diseases may also work for people with dementia.'\n","right_summary":"Drug called AZDO5030 originally designed to treat certain types of tumour.

{"document":"From top to third to second to top to second again. What a perfect game to represent such an absurd season. Bournemouth were out of it. Then they were in it. Then it all went bonkers and Eddie Howe was caught between feelings of regret and unhappiness with Paul Tierney, the referee. The stripped-down fact is that it finished 2-2. The glorious detail is that Bournemouth trailed to a Kieran Lee sucker punch, levelled through Yann Kermorgant and then had a man sent off. A problem? Not really. Chris Maguire converts an injury time penalty so salvage a draw for Sheffield Wednesday at Dean Court. Maguire celebrates his late, late strike as the Owls held Bournemouth to a draw on their home turf.

Matt Ritchie scored the kind of goal that belongs in the Premier League to put them in front. Job done? Not nearly. Chris Maguire scored a penalty for Wednesday deep into stoppage time and three point became one; a big step towards the top flight became a stumble. Howe was left 'heartbroken', but also frustrated, not least because he felt Callum Wilson deserved a penalty in the second half when he appeared to be fouled by Lewis Buxton. Bournemouth have had 15 penalties this season and Howe suggested that might be counting against them, saying in a radio interview: 'It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said don\u2019t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don\u2019 t want them to have any more.' His broader disappointment was also clear, having blown a major opportunity to keep top spot in a thrilling division. He said: 'It really is tough to take. That is why we love the game \u2013 the drama and twists and turns. 'The pain and frustration we need to transfer into motivation. This is our most successful season but we have had low moments. We have only two games and our objective is clear. We have to use this as motivation to move forward now. We have to respond.' Lee had put Wednesday in front with a 36th-minute header before Kermorgant levelled midway through the second half. A draw at that stage might have seemed fair but Simon Francis was sent off for two yellow cards and Bournemouth were back on the ropes. Cue bedlam. Ritchie launched a shot into the top corner after Andrew Surman laid off a free-kick but Maguire added to the madness in stoppage time. Wednesday manager Stuart Grey couldn't help but chuckle. He said: 'It took six and a half hours to get down here but we got on with it. If we left without anything it would have been disappointing.'

{"document":"A new mother who 'died' for 11 minutes during her son's birth woke up four days later with no memory of ever being pregnant or having her baby. Hilary Wilson, from Whitchurch, Shropshire, was technically dead for a terrifying 11 minutes after suffering a severe cardiac arrest as her son, Felix, was being born. The 41-year-old woke up four days later, with absolutely no idea that she had been pregnant, or that she had given birth to Felix just days earlier. It was only when she saw a picture of her new baby wearing her children's hand-me-downs that she realised he was her son. Hilary Wilson had a cardiac arrest during a Caesarean section  and 'died' for 11 minutes. When she woke up, she had no idea she had been pregnant or given birth to her son Felix (pictured now at nine months old) Mrs Wilson only realised she had a son when someone showed her a picture of Felix wearing a baby grow that her other children had worn when they were born, and it 'clicked' that he was her son. The mother-of-three has defied the odds and made a remarkable recovery,\u00a0despite being given just a 30 per cent chance of survival and an 85 per cent possibility of brain damage. Mrs Wilson, a translator, said: 'When I woke up, my friends and family would talk to me about Felix, but I had no idea what they were on about. 'I was trying to make sense out of everything - I didn't know where I was or what had happened - I had no idea that I'd ever been pregnant or just had a baby. 'It wasn't until my sister showed me a picture of Felix that things very slowly started to fall into place. Her older sons, Sebastian, six, and Lucas, four, had both worn a white baby grow with blue piping when they were newborns. 'Felix was wearing it in the picture - so I thought he must have been mine,' said Mrs Wilson. 'I knew no one else would have one like it, so when I saw him wearing it, I thought he must be mine. 'I made the conscious decision to believe what everyone was telling me, even though I'm not quite sure I'd accepted it just yet.' An amniotic fluid embolism is a rare but serious condition that occurs when amniotic fluid \u2014 the fluid that surrounds a baby in the uterus during pregnancy \u2014 or fetal material, such as hair, enters the maternal bloodstream. An amniotic fluid embolism is most likely to occur during childbirth or immediately afterward. Signs and symptoms of an amniotic fluid embolism might include:. Source: Mayo Clinic. She added:\u00a0'When I met him when he was six days old, I didn't really feel like he was mine - I wasn't interested in holding him, and I was happy for my mum to give him cuddles instead of me. 'It wasn't until I was well enough to go back to the maternity ward and could breastfeed Felix that I really started to bond with him. 'Slowly, vague memories of being pregnant and giving birth returned, and I gradually started to feel the instinct to look after him. 'Now, Felix and I have a wonderful relationship, and the whole ordeal almost feels like a dream.' Mrs Wilson suffered an amniotic fluid embolism. This is where the amniotic fluid \u2013 the liquid inside the sac in which the baby grows - or other matter from the foetus, such as hair, cells or other debris, gets into the mother's bloodstream. The condition can lead to seizures, coma, and cardiac arrest, where electrical activity of the heart becomes chaotic and it suddenly stops pumping blood around the body. Mrs Wilson had been in labour for 12 hours when doctors decided to perform a Caesarean. Just as baby Felix, now nine months, was being lifted out of the womb, Mrs Wilson went into cardiac arrest. She said: 'I remember feeling sick, and seconds later I had a cardiac arrest. 'They did CPR on me for 11 minutes and I had adrenaline injected into my heart. 'I lost four fifths of my blood because they hadn't finished the surgery on my C-section - I had to have a blood transfusion and was put on life support. 'I woke up four days later and had no idea what was going on - all I knew was that I was in a lot of pain. Mrs Wilson  was given just a 30 per cent chance of survival. Thankfully she made a remarkable recovery and is now at home with her family ((from left to right) Felix, Lucas, four, Sebastian, six, and husband Barry. Mrs Wilson can only remember vague details of being pregnant or Felix's birth. But he is now a 'perfectly healthy, smiley little baby', she said, and they are 'completely bonded' 'I was trying to make sense of everything around me, I thought maybe I was paralysed, or that I'd died - I eventually decided that I must be having a nightmare. 'I remember someone telling me that Felix was fine, but I was so confused - so many people would visit me and mention him, but I had no clue who they were talking about.' Family and friends showed Hilary photographs of her new son, but she remained confused and unable to recall any details about him. She said: 'I knew that the pain I was feeling was coming from my stomach, so when people talked about the baby, I thought it would make sense that my tummy hurt if I'd just had a Caesarean. 'But I wrestled with the idea of believing it, because whilst it all made sense, I couldn't remember. 'My sister showed me a picture of Felix on her iPad, and when I saw the baby grow he was wearing, something clicked. 'It was very strange - one minute I would have a grasp on reality, and the next I would be all over the place again.' Mrs Wilson finally met Felix for the first time when he was six days old, but she still struggled to accept that he was her baby. Mrs Wilson said she burst into tears when she saw Felix for the first time (he is pictured in hospital).

'The nurses had used a breast pump on me while I was sedated, so I was still able to breast feed.

{"document":"It had seemed fake tan was here to stay after becoming a beauty staple for many women who wanted to emulate their favourite celebrities\u2019 bronzed looks. But their determination to achieve the perfect glow appears to be fading away in favour of adopting a lighter look. The number of bottles of fake tan sold in 2014 fell by nearly a quarter (24.1 per cent) from the year before, bringing the value of sales down by 19.3 per cent to \u00a314.5million. The number of bottles of fake tan sold in 2014 fell by nearly a quarter from last year.

She added that artificial tanning products were the hardest hit sub-sector of the sun care market. And Sandra Vaughan, a beauty consultant for artificial tan brand Fake Bake, said the pale look is now more fashionable. Fake tanning had become part of many women\u2019s regular beauty regime thanks to its popularity among celebrities such as former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, the stars on Strictly Come Dancing and the cast \u2013 both male and female \u2013 of reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex. But even the TOWIE crew themselves admit the look can easily go wrong. Sam Faiers, who was a brand ambassador for Fake Bake, has described her horror at looking unnaturally orange on occasion. Pale skin icons include the likes of Keira Knightley, pictured (above) at the 87th annual Academy Awards, Cara Delevingne and Gwyneth Paltrow. She said: \u2018Just before Christmas I overdid it with the fake tan. I made my legs too dark and I just thought, what have I done?!\u2019 Other TOWIE performers have admitted similar errors, including Lauren Goodger, who was a particularly vivid colour when attending a Woman\u2019s Own event last year. Even the programme itself has ridiculed the dangers of fake tan. Charlie Sims became a laughing stock after emerging from a spay tan session designed to improve his appearance and self-esteem only to look like an orange extra from the famous Tango TV commercials. His sister, Chloe Sims, famously stripped off to be the face and body of Montana Tan\u2019s Starship Range. Georgia Percy, from Kantar Worldpanel, said sales of artificial tanning products were the hardest hit sub-sector of the suncare market in 2014. \u2018As with total suncare, the key contributor to decline was fewer shoppers, suggesting women are tending towards a more natural look,\u2019 she said. Lou Ellerton, of consultants the Value Engineers, told The Grocer magazine: \u2018Reality TV shows were effectively ongoing ads for fake tan but they passed their peak. 'It\u2019s like fake tan has been off the air for a while.\u2019 Pale skin icons include the likes of Keira Knightley, Cara Delevingne and Gwyneth Paltrow.

{"document":"It was a case of so near, yet so far for the Queen today as she roared on her filly, Ring of Truth, at Newbury today. The monarch, who was resplendent in a fuchsia suit and a matching hat, appeared unusually nervous and was spotted crossing her fingers in the Royal Box. Unfortunately for Her Majesty, her horse  was narrowly pipped to the post - prompting a brief look of horror and a rueful smile from her owner. Oh no! The Queen allows herself a look of horror as Ring of Truth is narrowly pipped to the post. One is not amused: The Queen briefly looks glum before smiling at her second place finish. Better than nothing: The Queen's second place appeared to go down well and she got a third place later on. The Queen, who has long been an avid racing fan, had a second runner later in the afternoon but was once again left to rue missed chances after her horse Capel Path came in third. Newbury Racecourse is currently hosting the Dubai Duty Free Spring Trials, one of the most prestigious dates on the flat racing calendar. The event, which coincides with the racecourse's annual real ale festival, also saw runners owned by fellow royal Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai take to the track. Unfortunately for the Emirati, the horses bred by his Godolphin Stud also failed to triumph with one, Strong Chemistry, taking second place in the Dubai Duty Free Full Of Surprises Handicap. Despite failing to register a win, the 88-year-old monarch was on cheerful form and chatted happily to jockey Richard Hughes in the parade ring ahead of the Maiden Stakes. Top tips: The Queen chatted to Ring of Truth's jockey Richard Hughes ahead of the race. Looking around: The Queen, joined by racing manager John Warren (second right), toured the parade ring. Enjoying the day: Afterwards, she made her way back to the Royal Box in the grandstand. The Queen certainly has plenty to smile about, with her fifth great-grandchild due next weekend and sex claims against her son Prince Andrew struck out by a US judge. She has also been  making the most of the recent spell of hot weather and has been pictured twice in the last seven days enjoying a trot around Windsor Great Park. The Queen, who usually rides wearing a silk scarf rather than a riding hat, first found herself in the saddle at the age of four after being presented with a Shetland pony, named Peggy, aged four. Since then, the royal stables have been home to a succession of steeds, among them Betsy, a black farm-bred horse who was her mount of choice in the 50's, and Surprise, a grey gelding whom the Queen famously galloped down the course at Ascot in 1961. Lovely: The Queen was resplendent in a cheerful fuchsia coat and a matching hat. Cheerful: The Queen has multiple reasons to be cheerful at the moment, including the impending royal birth. Great-grandchild: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child will be her fifth great-grandchild. Recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over Trooping the Colour on horseback. Nevertheless, the Queen remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and, according to sources, is a familiar sight at her Windsor stables. She is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies, some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren, notably Prince Edward's children, Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn. Along with her thoroughbred race horses, the Queen also breeds Fell ponies and has a stud specialising in Highland ponies at Balmoral. So close: Ring of Truth (left) tries to make up the gap between her and Harvard Man. Pipped: In the event, Harvard Man galloped ahead to win the Maiden Stakes at Newbury.\n","right_summary":"The Queen crossed her fingers as Ring of Truth galloped home.

{"document":"Even in a world of flash cars and designer clothes, many will be familiar with the saying: 'Money doesn't buy happiness.' It turns out, there are things that you can do to make you feel slightly happier everyday. The best part?\u00a0According to author of Happier People Healthier Planet, Dr Teresa Belton, they're all completely free. Dr Teresa Belton insists that there are many simple things - such as inviting a lonely person out to tea - that we can do on a daily basis to increase happiness, and they are all free. Researcher and education expert at the University of East Anglia, Dr Teresa Belton, believes that people living modestly tend to find more satisfaction in their lives. Simple activities such as inviting someone out for a cup of tea, singing in a community choir and practicing good posture can all improve general wellbeing. This is because they are all activities that generate a sense of belonging, and help the person adopt confident habits. Author Belton has insisted that practices as small as going on walks can be calming and restorative. The 62-year-old believes simple acts such as straightening posture (left) and joining a community choir (right) can increase happiness levels over time. Firstly the doctor emphasises that it is important to prioritise 'wellbeing' over happiness. Belton says: 'Wellbeing is a continuing state, while happiness can come and go. Wellbeing means that we both feel good and function well.' Her book, Happier People Healthier Planet, supports the belief that while many strive for material things that may generate temporary happiness, it is not sustainable way to be. Belton insists that it's actually non-material things that support our wellbeing, like good relationships and a sense of belonging. List five things for which you are grateful: Whether they are big or small things, Belton recommends doing this for ten weeks can have a big impact on wellbeing. Among her simply everyday tips to feeling happier right away - see below - she highlights seemingly trivial activities such as standing up straight and smiling, and even hanging washing up outdoors. The doctor and author also highlights that there are ways you can invest in happiness and wellbeing for the long run. Practices include regularly making lists of things for which you are grateful. In fact, studies have shown that doing this for a period of ten weeks can have a real lasting affect on wellbeing. Other practices include mindful meditation and taking up voluntary work. Declutter:  Give stuff away, donate possessions to charity or pass them on to someone who could use them. This can relieve stress and create a sense of lightness and unburdening. A less cluttered bedroom can also bring the added bonus of better sleep. Hang washing up outdoors:\u00a0Getting some fresh air and creating an orderly line of washing will give you a relaxing break and a reason to get outside in the garden. Invite a lonely person to tea: Or offer to help your neighbour with their garden, leaking pipe, shopping, etc. Feeling needed and having a sense of belonging to a community are important factors for a sense of wellbeing. Go for a walk: Time spent in green surroundings has shown time and time again to be calming and restorative. Even a green view is beneficial, so try and buy some indoor plants too: geraniums for a window sill, ivy for a dark corner, and herbs for the kitchen. Stand up straight, and smile:\u00a0The way we hold ourselves and our facial expression affects the way we feel. Adopt a confident posture and you will feel more confident; look calmly on the world and it will seem a friendlier place. Visit an empty beach or hilltop:\u00a0Being a tiny part of an immense landscape can reassuringly put worries into perspective. Get moving:\u00a0Physical activity gets us out of our heads and generates endorphins, the hormone which makes us feel good; dig the garden, cycle, walk, dance, make pastry, or even mow the lawn. Appreciate the little things:\u00a0From a spider spinning a web, to a bird singing: these are just a few of the endless everyday details which we often overlook or take for granted, yet which can delight us if we let them. List five things for which you are grateful:\u00a0Whether they are big or small. Research has shown that doing this every week for ten weeks can result in lasting increases in wellbeing, as it gets us into the habit of seeing our life through a positive lens. Join a community choir: Singing regularly with other people is rewarding not only because of the pleasure derived from the music itself, but also because it is sociable and it demands effort, commitment and attention. Take up regular voluntary work: Social connectedness, as well as freely giving your time, attention and energy, and making a positive difference  all contributes to our own satisfaction with life. Get stuck in:\u00a0Active engagement is a big aspect of personal wellbeing. If you really enjoy your chosen activity, you will lose yourself in it and experience a wonderful sense of 'flow'. Think about your place in the scheme of things: Having a sense of meaning or purpose in life, whether it is religious, political, social, artistic or any other framework, is known to be important for wellbeing. Take up mindfulness meditation:\u00a0Regular practice of mindfulness meditation decreases anxiety and increases calmness, working memory and flexibility of thought. Take charge:\u00a0Start a petition, write to your MP or local councillor, or join a campaign about an issue that concerns you. We are happier if we are proactive and feel like we have a say in things. Value relationships over material objects:\u00a0Levels of wellbeing have not risen in the UK since the 1970's despite an increase in affluence. It's relationships and social networks that contribute towards enduring happiness.\n","right_summary":"Teresa Belton, 62,\u00a0is author of Happier People Healthier Planet.

{"document":"A new collaborative robot (pictured) can work alongside human factory workers. Helpful robots are typically shown as mechanical maids or humanoid teachers in sci-fi films. But now there\u2019s a new collaborative robot that can work alongside human factory workers to give them a helping hand. The Fanuc CR-35iA claims to be the first 'heavy-lifting industrial collaborative robot' to work with humans without the need for safety fences. The Coventry-based company Fanuc's robot uses integrated vision technology called iRVision to keep an eye on humans and automatically stops  if it touches an operator. This removes the need for safety fences - a previous requirement for all industrial robots - and is said to increase efficiency and enable a higher level of automation, the firm claims. The robot can lift objects weighing up to 77 lbs (35kg) and could be used in a number of industries, from warehouses to production lines. For example, it could move heavy objects or assemble parts within a shared workspace without safety fences. \u2018Collaborative robot technology opens up a new era for manufacturing in which humans and robots will work even more closely on tasks; increasing productivity and efficiencies across the plant floor,\u2019 said Chris Sumner, vice president of Fanuc. The machine is covered in a green soft plastic cover, which is designed to protect humans and stop them being \u2018pinched\u2019 in the event they are touched by the robotic arm. Of course, robots have been used on production lines for decades. In the car industry for instance, many are automated so robots perform the bulk of dangerous tasks, such as welding, away from humans. Amazon has already introduced robots to it vast warehouses to work along human employees. The Fanuc CR-35iA claims to be the first 'heavy-lifting industrial collaborative robot' to work with human employees without the need for safety fences. Images of plans are shown above. Robots have been used on production lines for decades. In the car industry for instance, many are automated so that robots perform the bulk of dangerous tasks, such as welding (pictured), away from humans. Some 15,000 robots pick up items ordered by customers in warehouses to save humans walking miles. The robot can lift up to 77 lbs (35kg). It's designed to work alongside humans without the need for safety fences. The robot stops what it's doing if it touches a human. This is down to integrated vision which lets it 'see' human employees. It has a protective green covering so it doesn't 'pinch' workers. It's designed to be as reliable as other robots on production lines and could be used in warehouses to lift heavy objects, for example. \u2018We pick two to three times faster than we used to,\u2019 34-year-old Amazon worker Rejinaldo Rosales said during a short break from sorting merchandise into bins at Amazon's massive distribution centre in Tracy, California, about 60 miles east of San Francisco. \u2018It's made the job a lot easier.\u2019 The squat orange robots use technology acquired when the company bought robot-maker Kiva Systems in 2012, according to Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president for operations. The Tracy centre has 1.2 million square feet of space - the equivalent of 28 football fields \u2013 which are tended by 1,500 full-time employees and 3,000 Kiva robots, gliding swiftly and quietly around the warehouse. The robots navigate by scanning coded stickers on the floor, following digital commands that are beamed wirelessly from a central computer. Fanuc's robot can lift objects weighing up to 77 lbs (35kg) and could be used in a number of industries, from warehouses to production lines. This illustration shows it lifting a wheel into a car (left) and it moving a piece to a machine (pictured right) Each of the orange machines can slide under and then lift a stack of shelves that's four feet (1.2 metres) wide and holds up to 750 lbs (340kg) of merchandise. The system uses bar codes to track which items are on each shelf, so a robot can fetch the right shelves for each worker as orders come in. Workers are needed for more complex tasks such as shelving, packing and checking for damaged items and the robots adjust to their speed. Amazon has already introduced robots to it vast warehouses to work along human employees.\u00a0A Kiva robot is shown moving goods (left) and another robot unloading them (right), which is placed in a safety cage. Amazon has launched a competition encouraging engineers to create its next generation of shelf-picking robots. Bots will battle it out at the ICRA conference in Seattle in May. 'The challenge combines object recognition, pose recognition, grasp planning, compliant manipulation, motion planning, task planning, task execution, and error detection and recovery,' Amazon said. Participating robots will earn points by locating products on shelves, retrieving them and putting them into cardboard boxes ready to be sent to customers. Points will be deducted for dropped or damaged good and the team that creates the winning robot will win $26,000 (\u00a317,463). Amazon currently uses robots by Kiva Systems to fetch items so its human workforces doesn\u2019t have to walk as far in its vast warehouses.

At the hearing, the judge granted Robert Bates permission to go to the Bahamas for a family vacation. That decision prompted a response from the family of Eric Harris, the man Bates killed. \"We are not surprised that Mr. Bates pled not guilty.  We are, however, surprised that Mr. Bates would choose to go on a vacation to the Bahamas during this tumultuous time.  Whether intended or not, Mr. Bates' vacationing in the Bahamas at this time sends a message of apathy with respect to the shooting and Eric's life.  At a time when we are still mourning the death of a loved one that he shot down in the street, Mr. Bates will be relaxing and enjoying his wealth and privilege.\" Bates' preliminary hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. July 2. \"This will give us an opportunity to deal with the facts in the courtroom instead of the media and we're looking very much forward to that,\" said  Clark Brewster, one of his lawyers, after the hearing. Bates, 73, was working as a reserve deputy for the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office on April 2 when he was involved the arrest of Eric Harris in a weapons sting operation. Bates claims he meant to stun Harris with a Taser after Harris fled from officers, but mistakenly shot Harris with a gun instead. Bates has said the shooting was accidental. He has apologized to the Harris family, as has Sheriff Stanley Glanz. The lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that Bates wasn't qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff. The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has denied these allegations. Over the weekend, one of Bates' lawyers released most of his training documents and said they prove Bates had proper law enforcement training. Two deputies involved in arrest of Harris have been reassigned because of threats against them and their families, Glanz said Monday in a news conference.

{"document":"Gaioz Nigalidze, the current Georgian champion, was expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament when he was found using his smartphone in the middle of a match. A chess grandmaster has been thrown out of an international tournament and faces a 15-year ban after he was caught sneaking to the toilet to check moves on his mobile phone. Gaioz Nigalidze, the current Georgian champion, was expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament when he was found using his phone in the middle of a match. The two-time national champion was exposed when his opponent lodged a complaint when he grew suspicious about his frequent trips to the lavatory. Tournament organisers found Nigalidze had stored a mobile phone in a cubicle, covered in toilet paper. They announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page. The complaint was made by Nigalidze's opponent in their sixth-round match in the tournament, Armenia's Tigran Petrosian. He said: 'Nigalidze would promptly reply to my moves and then literally run to the toilet. 'I noticed that he would always visit the same toilet partition, which was strange, since two other partitions weren't occupied. 'I informed the chief arbiter about my growing suspicions and asked him to keep an eye on Gaioz. 'After my opponent left the very toilet partition yet another time, the arbiters entered it. 'What they found was the mobile phone with headphones; the device was hidden behind the pan and covered with toilet paper.' Tournament organisers at the Dubai Open Chess tournament\u00a0announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page. When officials confronted the Georgian, he denied owning the device but officials found the phone was logged into a social networking site under his name. They also found his match being analysed in one of the chess applications. He was promptly removed from the tournament and could now face a maximum 15-year ban from the game. When questioned about the offence,\u00a0Nigalidze said: 'Not everything is true in what Petrosian said'. This is not the first time a player was caught cheating at a chess tournament. In July 2013, Bulgarian player Borislav Ivanov was suspended from playing for four months by his national federation. It had been found most of his moves matched those of the leading computer chess analysis programs. Two years earlier the French chess federation suspended three players, including the national team captain, when it was alleged they used text messages, a remote chess computer and coded signals to beat the opposition at the 2010 Chess Olympiad. In 2008, at the Dubai Open, an Iranian player was banned when he was found to be receiving help from someone watching the game's live broadcast on the internet and was sending the moves through text messages. Tournaments sanctioned by the International Chess Federation - including the Dubai Open - do not allow players to carry mobile phones and other electronic devices during matches.\n","right_summary":"Gaioz Nigalidze has been expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament.

{"document":"Arizona officials who botched an investigation into the rape of a 13-year-old girl - allowing her rapist to continue to assault her for four years - have agreed to pay her $3.5 million. The payout by Maricopa County, which was revealed on Wednesday, comes after it emerged that Patrick Morrison continued to assault the mentally-disabled girl, his niece, and even got her pregnant when detectives failed to properly investigate the case. Her rape was among more than 400 sex-crime cases that were inadequately investigated or not looked into at all by Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office over a three-year period ending in 2007. Morrison, from Mesa, first raped his niece Sabrina Morrison in March 2007, and after she told a teacher the following day, authorities performed a rape kit on her. Payout: Sabrina Morrison, pictured left in an interview in 2012, will receive $3.5 million after sheriff's deputies failed to arrest her uncle, Patrick Morrison, right, after he raped her when she was 13. Even though the kit showed traces of semen, the sheriff's deputies did not collect a blood sample from Patrick Morrison - as requested by the lab - and left him walking the streets. Sabrina's mother, Vikki Morrison, said her daughter was known to make up stories, so when sheriff's deputies told her the rape kit had shown no evidence of a rape, she believed them. 'I was told straight to my face there was no evidence of any trauma or any sexual assault, so we thought she was lying the whole time,' she told\u00a0CBS5AZ in a 2012 interview. It meant that for the next four years, Morrison continued to rape his niece and even got her pregnant in 2009. But because of physical complications, the baby was aborted. He threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the assaults, Sabrina said as she spoke out about the ordeal in 2012. Her family said she was acting out so badly, that she was sent to live in a group home. Finally, four years after the initial attack, the case was re-opened and deputies gathered the blood sample from Morrison. The following year, he was arrested. Victim: Sabrina, pictured as a child, told a teacher she had been raped when she was 13 but authorities falsely said there was no evidence of the attack. It meant her uncle continued to rape her for four years. Locked up: The case was re-opened in 2011 and Morrison, pictured in court, was sentenced to 24 years. He pleaded guilty to one count of child molestation and two counts of attempted child molestation and was sentenced to 24 years in prison. 'That slipped through the cracks, we did due diligence after the fact that we found out, and we acted on it,' Sheriff Joe Arpaio explained at a Wednesday press conference. But the family was outraged. 'How do you feel when you find out your daughter's been telling you the truth and you didn't know it the whole time?' Vikki Morrison asked in the CBS interview. Sabrina's family filed a lawsuit against the department. The lawsuit alleged that the subsequent attacks on the girl could have been avoided if Arpaio's office arrested the suspect after he first abused her in March 2007. 'An eighth-grader could have solved this case,' attorney Charles Surrano said. 'They sat on the evidence, closed the case and never obtained the sample necessary to have the DNA testing done.' The decision to resolve the lawsuit marks the latest in a long string of legal settlements against Arpaio's office. Anger: Sabrina's mother, Vikki Morrison, said the sheriff's department had told her a rape kit showed there was no trace the teenager had been attacked, so she thought her daughter was lying. The county had previously paid more than $68 million in judgments, settlements and legal fees for the sheriff's office during Arpaio's 22-year tenure. Some settlements resolved lawsuits filed over the treatment of inmates in Arpaio's jails and the sheriff's failed corruption investigations of political foes. The settlement Wednesday applies only to Sabrina Morrison's lawsuit. It's unknown whether other victims in the botched investigations have filed similar lawsuits. The sheriff reflected on the legacy of the botched investigations at a Wednesday news conference, which was called to discuss a recent jail beating. 'We're talking about old history, but sometimes you learn from old history,' Arpaio said of the bungled cases. 'You try to do everything you can to hope that it never happens again.' He said he hopes the settlement money will go toward helping the victim and characterized the case's resolution as a good business decision, considering the girl's family had sought $30 million. Hot water: Her rape was among more than 400 sex-crime cases that were inadequately investigated or not looked into at all by the office of Sheriff Joe Arpaio (pictured) over a three-year period ending in 2007. The sheriff apologized in December 2011 for the bungled cases, and his office has since said it has moved to clear up the investigation and taken steps to prevent the problem from happening again. An internal review attributed the failures to understaffing and mismanagement. A former supervisor says her investigators were pulled away from time to time to help with training efforts and Arpaio's immigrant-smuggling squad. But Maricopa County Supervisor Steve Gallardo said the sheriff failed to apologize to Sabrina Morrison as the settlement was reached, Fox10 reported. 'It's unconscionable that a mentally challenged girl be raped for four years\u2026 and law enforcement failed to act,' he said. The sheriff rejected the claim. '[Gallardo has] always been blasting me for the last five years, you don't think he'll say \"thank you Sheriff for rescuing all the animals,\" or \"Sheriff we feel sorry for your detectives\",' said Arpaio.\n","right_summary":"Patrick Morrison first raped his mentally-disabled niece Sabrina Morrison in 2007 and after she told a teacher, a rape kit was carried out.

O'Connor's time of two minutes 09:51 seconds was the fastest recorded in the world this year and came comfortably inside the World Championships qualification mark of 2:10:20. Hannah Miley took the silver medal with a time of 2:11:65 and Aimee Willmott claimed bronze in 2:13:30. Siobhan-Marie O'Connor celebrates with second-placed Hannah Miley (left) and third-placed Aimee Willmott. O'Connor, who is the reigning Commonwealth champion, was short of her 2:08.21 personal best - a British record - but said making the team for Russia was her main focus. 'I'm chuffed, the (qualifying) times are a massive challenge but it means everyone has to step up and race world class times,' O'Connor said. 'I'm really just happy to have made the team. It was really tough. I'm happy with that time, I just wanted to go under 2.10. 'I would have ideally liked to have been closer to my personal best but sometimes you're not on your best form. To get the qualifying time was my main aim.' O'Connor's time of two minutes 09:51 seconds was the fastest recorded in the world this year. The performance of O'Connor, who won 100m freestyle gold on Tuesday, is particularly impressive considering the heavy disruptions to her winter training programme. The pool at the University of Bath, where the 19-year-old has trained for most of her career, has been closed for six months renovation meaning she and her group have been forced to relocate 32 miles away at Millfield School. 'It has been hard over the last six months,' O'Connor added. 'It has been a challenge but everyone has challenges in sport. 'It's just something we have to deal with. It couldn't have been any better and I'm proud to have adapted to it. 'It's definitely been tough, we've all felt that. Our pool is open in Bath after this though so I'm looking forward to getting back there and getting some consistency again.' The 19-year-old claimed two titles despite heavy disruptions to her winter training programme. Jazz Carlin followed up her success in the 400m freestyle on Wednesday with a dominant performance in the 800m freestyle to win another gold medal. Carlin clocked 8:21:58 which was enough to seal the title but she missed the World Championships qualifying time of 8:21:22. The Commonwealth and European champion is still likely to race the 800m in Russia, after finishing more than 10 seconds clear of Jessica Thielmann (8:32:19) in second and Camilla Hattersley in third (8:37:99). 'I'm not too disappointed to miss the qualifying time,' Carlin said. 'For myself I would have liked to have gone quicker but to make the worlds qualifying time yesterday I'm sure I'll get to swim the event there. 'It felt a bit tough tonight, I didn't really get into it, I felt a bit heavy in my stroke but that happens.' Elizabeth Simmonds won the women's 100m backstroke, registering 1:00:03, while Craig McNally took gold in the men's 200m backstroke with a time of 1:57:58 and Stephen Milne clinched the men's 1500m freestyle title in 14:58:25.\n","right_summary":"Siobhan-Marie O'Connor won her second title of the British Championships.

{"document":"A builder who wolf-whistled a young woman only to be accused of sexual harassment said today she is a 'silly little girl' who was 'lucky' to have received the attention. Ian Merrett, 28, is astonished that Poppy Smart, 23, did not take it as a compliment, which he says has helped him 'snog loads of girls' in the past. The builder  and his colleagues whistled at her every day for a month as she passed their Worcester construction site. Miss Smart, who compared the wolf-whistling to racial discrimination,\u00a0eventually filmed them and asked West Mercia Police to investigate alleged sexual harassment. Mr Merrett admits it was probably him whistling but called Miss Smart a 'silly little girl' who should never have gone to the police. He said: 'I'm sure if she walks past again and she is lucky she will get wolf-whistled again. I have wolf-whistled so many girls and got so many birds and snogged so many girls off the back of that, and never had a complaint before. But I've got a girlfriend so need to be careful what I say'. Scroll down for video. Fighting back: Builder Ian Merrett, left, was accused of sexual harassment for wolf-whistling Poppy Smart, 23, right, every day for a month, but he has said she should take it as a compliment. Mr Merrett, who was jailed for 12 months in 2009 for affray, also accused her of damaging the reputation of his trade and 'hard working' builders by trying to get them prosecuted. Miss Smart, a marketing co-ordinator, contacted West Mercia Police over the regular taunts and the force went to the building site in Worcester to warn the men about their conduct. She also filmed the whistles and handed the evidence to officers, who followed up Poppy's complaint but had not taken further action, the force said. Mr Merrett, who was branded 'disgraceful' by the judge when he was convicted for the unprovoked train attack six years ago, said: 'It's highly likely it was me who did that wolf-whistle. I've seen the news coverage and it's not right. 'Wolf-whistling is part and parcel of working on a site, it's complimenting a girl. I'm a builder and my mates are builders. We are all hard working people and our reputation has been damaged' 'I can remember that day when she took the video, we were under-pinning a wall that day. 'I only saw the back of her, I didn't even see her face and you can see in the video the wolf-whistle comes after she had passed the gate. 'I didn't even see her face, and I wouldn't recognise her if I fell over her in the street, so I don't know how that could possibly be sexual harassment. 'Police came to our site and said someone had made an allegation of harassment. They showed us the video so we stopped doing it. 'It's not worth getting into trouble over some silly little girl. I don't know why she complained, she must be thinking things above her station.' Mr Merrett was 23 when he received a 12-month prison sentence for an unprovoked attack on a Malvern to Birmingham train in 2009. Jailing him and his friend Anthony Hannay, Judge Amjad Nawaz condemned their 'disgraceful' behaviour after they repeatedly punched passenger Michael Powell in a drunken attack. At the time, the judge told them: 'Loutish behaviour like this is sadly becoming all too common.' Speaking today, Mr Merrett shrugged off the attack, and said: 'It was all a very long time ago when I used to go around town getting p***** up and fighting. 'I was sentenced for 12 months and served six months. It's the first and last time I've been in prison but not the first time I've had a run in with the law. 'As far as I'm concerned, it's in the past, I'm older now and I've got a job and a kid. I'm a different person.' Ms Smart recorded one of the occasions she walked past the building site. There is no suggestion any of the men pictured in the mobile phone footage (shown left and right) were involved in the alleged wolf-whistling. Crime scene: The building yard in Worcester where Ms Smart alleges workman wolf-whistled at her while on her way to work. 'Disrespectful': The 23-year-old marketing co-ordinator (pictured) claimed builders at a construction site wolf-whistled at her every morning as she walked to work in Worcester city centre. Earlier this week, Miss Smart condemned men who wolf-whistle, claiming it was demeaning and compared it to racism. She decided to take action after the workmen whistled and made disrespectful comments towards her as she walked past the building site on her way to work, making it unbearable for her on her daily commute to Worcester city centre. The marketing co-ordinator said it went on for at least a month before she decided to take action. She said: 'I had to walk past that way to go to work and it got so bad that they would actually come out of the building site at the time I walked down the road. 'I often had my earphones in but I could still hear the whistling over it. 'I eventually contacted the building company and the police when it got so bad I even considered changing my route to work but thought 'why should I do that?' 'I remember one of the builders, who was probably 18 or 19, got right in my face and said 'morning love' to me when he was stood with an older guy.' She told Newsbeat they often 'blocked the pavement' forcing her to walk around them. She said: 'I started wearing sunglasses so I didn't have to look at them. I started putting headphones on so I didn't have to hear them. 'Eventually it got to the day where I had enough.' Miss Smart said she decided to film the workmen on her mobile phone and hand the footage to police because 'women shouldn't have to deal with it.' She added: 'I've noticed this behaviour more and more around the city. 'Men will lean out of their cars or vans and shout comments about my appearance or whistle and I know and have seen this happen to others as well. 'I think more women should speak out about this behaviour, maybe it will make people think twice. 'Imagine hearing someone speaking that way to your sister, mother, wife or daughter. 'Personally I don't think that such comments, even if they are considered complimentary by the perpetrators, are appropriate.

{"document":"A bookkeeper has been sacked after calling her boss 'a complete d***' in a text message - and then accidentally sending it to him. Louise Nesbitt was employed at Perth mining exploration company Dragon Mountain Gold. On January 12 last year, she mistakenly sent a text to her boss meant for her daughter's boyfriend who was engaged as a contact plumber for the firm. A Perth office bookkeeper was fired from her job after she called her boss 'a complete d***' in a text message. In the message, Ms Nesbitt wrote: 'Now remember ... [her employer] Rob is a complete d***... we know this already so please try your best not to tell him that regardless of how much you might feel the need.' Realising her mistake, she immediately texted her boss asking him to delete the message and ignore its contents. Ms Nesbitt sent a further message explaining the insult was a 'joke within our family'. 'I need to explain ... that message came across so wrong,' she said. 'That is not how I feel. My sense of humour is to exaggerate. It is not how I feel. 'Please forget it and just go on as normal. I am very very sorry.' Ms Nesbitt - who had employed at Dragon Mountain Gold since 2004 - was fired five days after the incident, with her employer saying it was due to 'gross misconduct'. She filed a unfair dismissal complaint with the Fair Work Commission. While she cross examined, Ms Nesbitt argued the text had been taken out of context. The commission also heard she had sent an email to her employer expressing the view she did not think he listened to her or took her counsel on board. This had been causing tension between the two before the January 12 incident. Commissioner DJ Cloghan ruled against Ms Nesbitt. 'On the evidence, I am not persuaded that when Ms\u00a0Nesbitt\u00a0referred to Mr Gardner as \"a complete d***\", it was her sense of humour to exaggerate or, that it was \"light-hearted insult\" or it should be read in the context of the person it was meant for,' Commissioner DJ Cloghan said.

{"document":"An artist with a penchant for snapping urban architecture has come up with an innovative new way of making the most of his photography. French photographer and illustrator, Thomas Lamadieu, takes snaps of the sky in courtyards and built-up areas to create a frame of buildings. The space in between then acts as a canvas for his playful illustrations which he has dubbed 'sky art'. On his\u00a0website\u00a0Thomas says that his artistic aim is to 'show a different perception of urban architecture and the everyday environment around us, what we can construct with a boundless imagination'. Before and after: Lamadieu's original  shot (left) and after it is transformed into 'sky art' (right) Lamadieu, who is also known as Roots Art, is based in France but travels the world to photograph the space between buildings in various cities. In the past year alone he has visited Belgium, Germany, Canada, the United States and South Korea in his quest to find the perfect sky canvases for his illustrations. Since he began creating sky art in 2011,  Lamadieu has made a name for himself among critics, art lovers and journalists all around the world. Speaking to the Independent, Lamadieu said: 'The sky drawings series really started with as a way of playing with my imagination to show how these seemingly empty spaces in the urban environment could be reinterpreted in different and creative ways.' 'The bearded man in my images stands for the sky itself, the big man in the sky, but it\u2019s not meant to be religious in any way'. Surreal: Three characters draw their own illustrations in an inverted sky shot. Upside down: A bearded figure rides a cat in between the buildings. Peace out: An illustration of a man playing an electric guitar fills the sky space in this photograph. Cheshire cat: A drawing of a couple embracing behind a grinning cat fills the gap where the sky would have originally been. Using a fish-eye lens camera to capture the perfect vertical shot, Thomas Lamadieu then illustrates the graphic shape created between buildings using Microsoft Paint. These abstract canvases depict a collection of humorous characters and surreal scenes. One inverted upshot depicts three bearded men drawing a picture of the night sky; meanwhile another shows a woman with hair not dissimilar to that of Marge Simpson reclining between two buildings. Self portrait? A man spray painting clouds on a canvas fills the skyscape in this photograph taken in a courtyard. Twit twoo: A black and white illustration of an owl looks down upon this oval shaped void. Thumbs up: An image of a man holding a Polaroid of a smiling cloud is superimposed onto a shot of town houses. A signature Lamadieu figure appears to be a bearded man in a Breton striped top who features in various guises throughout the 'sky art' images. In one picture he appears as a giant rock star wielding an electric guitar, and in another he has a camera around his neck whilst presenting a Polaroid of a cloud. As well as surrealism, optical illusion is also a key theme in Lamadieu's work - these confusing images combining photography with clever illustration are certainly hard to get your head around. Jack in the box: An illustration of a masked man holding a Jack in the box toy overlooks this snap between two brick buildings and a washing line. Optical illusion: This sky shot has been transformed into a clever optical illusion thanks to Lamadieu's illustration. One image that plays a trick on the eye is a\u00a0vertical\u00a0sky photograph combined with a horizontal illustration of a game of cat and mouse to mind-boggling affect. Similarly, an image of a bearded man in a striped top holding some cloud shaped balloons creates a trompe l'oeil that the facade of the building is a pavement with illustrated figures superimposed on it. Meanwhile, the sky becomes the sea in another illustrated image of a man on a boat surrounded by circling sharks. Trompe l'oeil: It's difficult to tell which way is up thanks to this clever and confusing illustration. Sea-ing double: The distorted angle of this photo combined with sea illustration make it a mind-bending photo to look at.

{"document":"Rome (CNN)Italy is coping with a rising wave of desperate migrants from Africa and Middle East hoping to make it to Europe. From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy. According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea. CNN's Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.\n","right_summary":"The Italian coast guard says 8,480 migrants were rescued from Friday to Monday.

{"document":"A radical Muslim preacher has been refused a passport after the Home Office accused him of planning to join Islamic State. Trevor Brooks, an associate of Islamist firebrand Anjem Choudary, was told it was not in the public interest for him to have a passport because he is seen as a terror risk. A Home Office letter says that Brooks, also known as Abu Izzadeen, is an extremist linked to members of the banned group Al Muhajiroun. Trevor Brooks is a known associate of Islamist firebrand preacher Anjem Choudary (pictured) The letter adds: 'It is also assessed that you intend to travel overseas to Syria where you would use this opportunity to engage in terrorism-related activity, likely fighting alongside the terrorist organisation known as the Islamic State.' Brooks, 39, was released from prison last month after serving part of his 11-month term for breaching bail on a terrorist offence. The Home Office said it could not discuss individual cases. Chourdary made headlines last month when it emerged he had been invited to speak at the Oxford Union despite being on police bail on suspicion of being a member of a banned terror group. The notorious rabble rouser received an invitation by letter from the debating society, which stated it would be a 'great privilege' to have Choudary appear as the star guest. Choudary, who once said that Woolwich terror victim Fusilier Lee Rigby would 'burn in hellfire', was even offered a choice of days on which to attend the debate entitled: This house believes that radicalism is born at home. Britain's most notorious hate preacher proudly showed off his invitation after launching a hate-filled rant against Western society outside the Houses of Parliament in late March. He said: 'I am still on police bail after being arrested by Scotland Yard in September last year. 'But the police can't stop me from speaking. They can't stop me from going to the Oxford Union where I've been invited to speak.'

{"document":"Dr Dorin Scladan removed the 11lb (5kg) growth from the woman, who had believed she was pregnant. A Romanian woman who believed she was pregnant was devastated to be told she actually had an 11lb tumour inside her uterus. Madalina Neagu, 42, arrived at a hospital in with severe pain in her abdomen and told doctors she believed she was in labour. As a result, medics at Botosani County Hospital prepared to operate to deliver the child. But after carrying out tests, they were shocked to discover she wasn't pregnant at all. Instead, she was actually carrying a 11lbs (5kg) tumour inside her uterus. One of the doctors treating her, Dr Dorin Scladan, 47, said: 'As the woman told us she was pregnant, we initially expected pregnancy complications. 'In fact, the size of her belly was quite similar to that of a nine-month pregnant woman, so we didn't have any reason to doubt what she told us.' Dr Sclandan and his colleage Dr Camelia Todica, 43, carried out an operation to remove the tumour. The patient was then transferred to intensive care - and doctors say she will recover. Dr Scladan said: 'We don't often see a tumour of this size and in this location.' The news comes after last year MailOnline reported on the story of Lorna Fulton, 44, who desperately wanted a family and believed she was pregnant when her stomach began to swell. She had ballooned to a size 26 and her waistline had been expanding despite months of dieting. But while she hoped this was a sign she was expecting, specialists discovered a huge ovarian cyst. Mrs Fulton was forced to undergo a full hysterectomy at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary where medics drained more than 32 litres of fluid from her stomach. It was revealed she had been carrying around a 5st cyst, a sac of fluid that forms on the ovary, for months. She recovered after the operation, and although she now cannot have children, says she feels 'lucky to be alive'. Doctors carried out emergency surgery to remove the tumour from the woman's uterus, and she was transferred to intensive care. And in 2012, MailOnline reported on the story of Kayleigh Terry, 21, who believed she was pregnant with her first child after gaining weight. But she was terrified to discover she actually had cancer. An ultrasound scan revealed she had a large cancerous growth which covered an area from her breast to her lower abdomen. She was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma and had emergency chemotherapy to shrink the potentially deadly tumour. Miss Terry lost her hair and eye-lashes along with 3st in weight after the shrunken tumour was removed a few months later. But after treatment, she was given the all clear, and now hopes to start her own family.\n","right_summary":"WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT.

{"document":"Russia yesterday lifted a ban on supplying Iran with an air defence missile system which could be used to protect nuclear sites. Vladimir Putin gave the go-ahead for the deal, with the defence ministry saying it was ready to supply the S-300 missile equipment \u2018promptly\u2019. The move is likely to anger both the U.S. and Israel at a time of heightened tensions between the world powers and following a landmark deal on nuclear weapons. Moscow blocked deliveries of the surface to air missiles to Iran in 2010 after the United Nations imposed sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme, barring hi-tech weapons sales. Russia yesterday lifted a ban on supplying Iran with the air defence S-300 missile system (above), which could be used to protect nuclear sites. But the Russian president lifted the ban after Tehran struck an interim deal with Britain and five other countries to curb nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The framework deal, reached this month, intended to significantly restrict Iran\u2019s ability to produce nuclear weapons, while giving it relief from international sanctions. The negotiations have been heavily criticised by Israel which has warned against Iran having any nuclear activities. Russia signed the \u00a3545million ($800m) contract to sell Iran the S-300 missile system in 2007, but later suspended their delivery because of strong objections from the U.S. and Israel. Vladimir Putin (above) gave the go-ahead for the deal, with the defence ministry saying it was ready to supply the  equipment. The contract to deliver the system was heavily criticised by Israel and the U.S., who feared it could be used to protect Iranian nuclear sites. When it was cancelled, Iran filed a lawsuit with a court in Geneva, seeking \u00a32.7billion ($4bn) in damages for breach of contract, but the court has not yet issued a ruling. Moscow said it had no choice but to annul the deal when the UN imposed sanctions, outlawing the sale of advanced weapons. Despite the sanctions, Russia and Iran have remained close allies. The deal on Iran\u2019s suspected nuclear activities is supposed to be finalised by June 30. There is no firm agreement on how or when to lift the current sanctions. The announcement comes as the U.S. slammed Russia for flying a fighter jet close to a U.S. reconnaissance plane in an \u2018unsafe and unprofessional manner\u2019 last week. Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said the U.S. was filing a complaint to Russia after the incident over the Baltic Sea, in the international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot\u2019s action were \u2018unsafe and professional due to the aggressive manoeuvres it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed\u2019, Mr Wright added. Russian officials reportedly denied their pilot did anything wrong. The incident was not first time the U.S. protested to Moscow what it considered to be an unsafe intercept. Last April, a Russian fighter jet intercepted a US reconnaissance plane in international airspace over the Sea of Okhotsk.\n","right_summary":"Vladimir Putin gave the go-ahead  to supply the S-300 missile equipment.

Now, 18 months later, Lawrence tells ABC that little Wil 'brings a light to our family.' He said he once believed having a child with Down Syndrome would put limits on what he and his family could accomplish. Instead, Lawrence said, little Wil has taken the limits off and 'opened so many doors' for his family In return, the father of five has taken the limits off the child and given him a one-of-a-kind ability. The ability to fly. Scroll down for video. 'Wil Can Fly:' A Utah photographer, Alan Lawrence (left), created a photo series in which his 18-month-old son, Wil (right), who has Down Syndrome appears to be flying. The father created a photo series called 'Wil Can Fly' in which the toddler appears to be flying in many different scenes. Lawrence, who began taking the photos when Wil was just months old, created the illusion by holding his son up in the photos and later cropping himself out. He posted the photos on his blog --\u00a0That Dad Blog -- and later on his Instagram\u00a0account. After receiving positive feedback, Lawrence decided to compile the photos in a calendar and plans to donate half the proceeds to two Down Syndrome foundations, KSL\u00a0reports. The family recently started a Kickstarter campaign. 'When Wil was little, he would lie on his stomach and raise his arms and legs like he was flying. It wasn't something any of my other kids did,' Lawrence told ABC. 'We all said, 'Look, he's flying!' Lawrence said his goal is to raise awareness about Down Syndrome. He admitted in his blog that he and his wife Nikki knew very little about the disorder when Wil was born in October 2013. The father said he hopes to photograph Wil 'flying' in other destinations to raise more awareness. He also told ABC he hopes to help people overseas who do not have access to the same level of care through his YouTube channel by posting therapy tutorials.

{"document":"A four-year-old boy has returned home after being mauled by their family's newly adopted pit bull. Gavin Tobeck of Lacey, Washington suffered from a broken cheekbone, jaw and nose bridge, and needed sections of a rib to repair his eye sockets after the attack by their dog Smash on April 1. The boy also lost five baby teeth and three permanent tooth buds. In an effort to save her son, 29-year-old Alissa Evans' friend threw hot coffee on the dog which led to the animal releasing his grip on Gavin. Doctors thought that the young boy would not make it, but after spending six days at Harborview Medical Center, he was released late on Tuesday and has begun returning to a normal life, according to\u00a0KOMO News. Following a ten-day quarantine to check for rabies, Smash is scheduled to be euthanized by Thurston County Animal Service on Saturday at the Tobecks' request. Scroll down for video. Gavin Tobeck (pictured left with his mom Alissa Evans) was left with a broken cheekbone, jaw and nose bridge, in addition to needing sections of a rib to repair his eye sockets after the attack. The family had adopted the pit bull Smash from friend of their neighbor on March 16 and said there were no previous signs of aggression (above Smash and Gavin) Following the attack earlier this month, Gavin told KOMO: 'He ate me.' His mother said that they both were lucky. Evans said: 'I got lucky, he got lucky. He still has his lips, he still has his eyes. He has five teeth.' 'He is a walking miracle,' she added. 'If it was one millimeter to the left he would have died instantly.' The Tobecks had adopted the one-and-a-half-year-old puppy on March 16 from a friend of their neighbor, according to the Olympian. Evans said there were no previous signs of aggression from Smash. 'I hate to see him put down, but I would not trust that dog,' said Evans. 'I wouldn't trust him with an adult no matter what people say.' Gavin and Smash were playing in the backyard when the dog attacked the child. His mother tried to stop the animal but he bit her and then pushed her to the ground before going for the boy, she said. Gavin was hospitalized at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle for six days following the attack on April 1 and was released late on Tuesday. Following a ten-day quarantine to check for rabies, Smash is scheduled to be euthanized by Thurston County Animal Service on Saturday at the family's request. Once her friend was able to get the dog to stop, they called the police. 'It was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my entire life,' Evans said. 'I literally thought that my son...I was watching him die.' Since Gavin's release from hospital, he has been reunited at home with his sister Serenity, six, and brother David, seven. His mother has also made a point to cover the mirrors in her apartment to keep Gavin from seeing the injuries on his face. Evans has also started a GoFundMe\u00a0page to help raise money to replace his baby teeth, as she said his insurance will not cover all of the repairs because he can eat soft food. She wrote on the page that she wants nothing more than for Gavin to grow up as normal as possible following the tragic experience. 'I appreciate all of the people who have help support Gavin in his road to recovery,' she wrote on the GoFundMe page. Evans said her son is a 'walking miracle' and that they are both lucky following the attack. 'I want everyone to know that everything that has been donated on this site is strictly for Gavin. 'If the dental work is done at no cost then it will be put in a savings account to later be used on the\u00a0permanent\u00a0teeth or it will be kept there for when he turns 18 and he can do what he wants with it. 'I want to make it clear that this site was created for Gavin and it will be used solely on him. 'I know a lot of people are concerned that this is a publicity stunt but it has never been about that and will never be about that.' As of Saturday, the GoFundMe page had raised\u00a0$1,360 in donations out of a $10,000 goal. No charges will be filed against the previous owner of Smash since Evans said the dog showed no earlier signs of aggression, according to KOMO.\n","right_summary":"Gavin Tobeck of Washington was attacked by one-and-a-half-year-old Smash while in his backyard on April 1; he was released late on Tuesday.

{"document":"Charlie Chaplin's divorce papers lay bare the film star's 'cruel and inhumane' treatment of his teenage bride during their short-lived marriage. Chaplin's union to Lita Grey, who was nearly 20 years his junior, lasted just three years. The iconic film star was said have bedded the impressionable 16-year-old after promising her marriage and then tried to convince her to have an abortion when she fell pregnant. On the pairs wedding night Chaplin was also said to have confided in friends that the union was a better prospect than prison. An original copy of the couples 50-page divorce papers was set to fetch an estimated \u00a315,000 when it goes under the hammer, after being found in America. The 50-page divorce papers of Charlie Chaplin and his second wife Lita Grey were found in a bank in America. Charlie Chaplin, left, married second wife Lita Grey, right, who was nearly 20 years his jounior, in 1924 and the union lasted for just three years. The divorce papers are set to fetch an estimated \u00a315,000 when they go under the hammer in Plymouth. Chaplin, then 35, married his second wife Lita, 16, in 1924. They divorced just three years later with the teenager lifting the lid on their marriage. In the papers it was alleged that Chaplin slept with the 'virtuous and inexperienced' Lita when she was barely 16 after promising to marry her. On their wedding night Chaplin was said to have told friends that the marriage was a better option than prison. He said to Lita: 'This marriage won't last long, I will make you so damn sick of me that you won't want to live with me.' Another part claims Chaplin delayed marrying Lita after she fell pregnant in an attempt to get her to have an abortion or 'criminal operation'. And the silent movie star was accused of calling his young bride a 'gold digger' who tried to ruin his career and stood in the way if his professional success. The papers also contain an order stopping Chaplin from moving his wealth before the settlement so it would not affect the court proceedings. Only around 16 copies of the divorce proceedings were believed to have been made, one sent to Chaplin himself and the others sent to various film companies and banks, involved in the proceedings. The papers for sale in Devon, were sent to the 1st National Bank of Los Angeles on the 11th Jan 1927. Almost a century later they are being sold by Parade Antiques on Plymouth for \u00a315,000. The papers for sale were sent to the 1st National Bank of Los Angeles on the 11th Jan 1927. Lita claimed that she endured 'cruel and inhumane' treatment by Chaplin in the legal papers. John Cabello, who owns the antiques shop, said: 'We got it from a person in America - he was told to clear out some supplies and old documents at the bank and he found them. 'He was told they would be thrown away and he kept them instead. 'When the papers were published, Chaplin was ostracised for a while. People in the know thought he was quite a nasty piece of work. 'All this comes out and makes for quite hard reading, even by today's standards.' Rob Morrish, 27, who runs the shop's website, poured over the historic legal documents. The 27-year-old said: 'About a week's worth of work went into researching the document, reading through it took some time. 'It's all hand signed and very old and fragile. It was folded for a long time and required a lot of very careful handling.' The papers reveal intimate details of the couples unstable relationship, believed to be an attempt by Lita's lawyers to tarnish Chaplin's reputation and gain a bigger settlement. Mr Morrish said: 'They met on set of one of his films and he seduced her as a young woman. It was frowned upon but he tried to make the most of the situation. 'When she became pregnant he wasn't particularly pleased to be trapped in a marriage. 'He squirrelled her away and did not report the birth until months later to make it look like the child was conceived after they wedded. The papers also contain an order stopping Chaplin from moving his wealth before the settlement so it would not affect the court proceedings. Lita was granted a $800,000 settlement when the couple eventually divorced in 1927. 'She was quite a young woman when they divorced and she was being sent by her lawyers to get as much as they could. She has said she regretted it in later life. 'It was way above and beyond what is standard for divorce proceedings, even for now.' Eventually in 1927, Lita and Chaplin divorced and she was granted a settlement of $800,000, the largest at the time. Mr Morrish said: 'She achieved what her lawyers wanted. In the end she got what she wanted but he still had a fantastic career after that.'\n","right_summary":"Charlie Chaplin, 35, \u00a0married his second wife Lita Grey in 1924.

'To have taken so many wickets in Test cricket is no mean feat because a fast bowler's life is a short one. To be four wickets away from Botham's 383 is a phenomenal achievement.

Breaking Bad: Cheryl Heineman (left), 45, a third-grade teacher from Florida, is accused of selling narcotics to an undercover officer with her 20-year-old lover, Jack Lindsey (right) Hauled off to jail: Heineman was arrested Wednesday outside Central Avenue Elementary School in Kissimmee, where she's worked since 2005. The arrests came at the conclusion of a six-week investigation that was launched in early March after an informant tipped off police that Lindsey has been known to deal drugs. According to a 26-page arrest affidavit, an undercover detective contacted Lindsey late last month asking to purchase acid and Xanax. The officer stated that he had bought various controlled substances - Xanax, hydrocodone, tramadol, oxycodone, ecstasy and methamphetamine - from the suspect on three previous occasions. Investigators believe that Heineman, who is married and has three sons, had a romantic relationship with Lindsey and would act as his driver on drug deals, reported WKMG. Lindsey arranged a meeting March 25 with the undercover officer acting as a buyer in the parking lot of the Tractor Supply store on 13th Street in St Cloud, telling him that 'his girl' would deliver the product. Partners in crime: According to police, Lindsey set up a drug deal last month, telling an undercover cop acting as a buyer that 'his girl,' Heineman will deliver the pills.

{"document":"Scottish voters would rather have a referendum on the EU than another independence vote, a new survey has revealed. The idea of having another referendum on Scotland's future in the UK before 2020 was ranked 19th on a list of 23 policies presented to voters. It comes after Scottish First Minister  Nicola Sturgeon last night refused to rule out staging a second independence vote if the SNP wins the 2016 Holyrood elections. Scroll down for video. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was campaigning in Aberdeen today ahead of a second TV debate tonight. When questioned on the issue in last night's Scottish leaders TV debate, Ms Sturgeon insisted an SNP victory in the General Election would not trigger another referendum. But she added it was 'another matter' whether a vote for her party in the 2016 Holyrood elections would bring about a second vote on independence. Ms Sturgeon has also vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. But a poll by Ipsos Mori for BBC Scotland reveals that a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union was more popular with voters north of the border than another independence ballot. More than 1,000 adults were questioned for the research, with pollsters asking them to give various issues a score of between one and 10, depending on how important these were to them. A score of one meant a policy should not be implemented while 10 was taken to mean it should be put into action immediately. In last night's TV showdown with the Scottish leaders of Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems, Mr Sturgeon refused to rule out a second independence vote before 2020. Ms Sturgeon has\u00a0 vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. The most popular policy was increasing the minimum wage for those aged over 21, which was given a score of 8.2. Giving the Scottish Parliament power over all welfare benefits was eighth most popular, with a score of 7.1, while transferring full responsibility for income tax to Holyrood came 10th on the list at 6.8. Holding another independence referendum by 2020 was given a score of 5.6, compared to 6.1 for a referendum on remaining in the EU. Scottish National Party election campaign director Angus Robertson insisted the poll showed support for his party's main policies. He said: 'This is a very welcome poll - it demonstrates that the people of Scotland share our view that the Westminster parties are not delivering on their referendum vow, and want far more power for Scotland. 'Electing a strong team of SNP MPs in May is the only way to ensure that Scotland gets the power we need to build social justice and economic prosperity.' Scotland's political leaders, from left to right, Tory Ruth Davidson, Labour's Jim Murphy, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie faced off in a live TV election debate last night. Overall, Scots prefer more public spending ahead of paying off the deficit \u2013 but also favour the Government's welfare cap. However, there is also widespread support for a Mansion Tax and an increase in the top rate of income tax to 50p. Mark Diffley, Director, Ipsos MORI Scotland said: 'The poll gives a clear steer about where the economic priorities for voters in Scotland lie. 'Broadly, Scots want to see measures to improve the standard of living, particularly a higher minimum wage, rises in pensions and lower energy bills. 'There is also a preference for higher targeted public spending even if that means the deficit is not eliminated in the next five years and targeted tax increases for those with the greatest income and wealth.'\n","right_summary":"Another independence vote\u00a0ranks 19th on list of 23 policies for Scots.

{"document":"Pope Francis urged the international community not to 'look the other way' and act over the killings of Christians around the globe, during his Easter Monday address. Speaking to tourists and Catholic pilgrims in St Peter's Square, the pontiff asked for 'tangible help' from communities all over the world for Christians persecuted because of their faith - but stopped short of suggesting what actions should be taken. The Pope, aged 78, has been increasingly vocal about the fate of Christians being targeted by Islamic extremists in parts of the Middle East, Africa and Asia. A gust of wind blows as Pope Francis gives his Easter Monday address. He urged the international community not to 'look the other way' as Christians across the world face violence and attacks because of their religion. Hundreds of Catholic pilgrims and tourists stood in St Peter's Square in Vatican City to listen to the Pope speak on Easter Monday. He urged for 'tangible help' to Christians being persecuted around the globe. The latest address follows his speech on Easter Sunday, where he said he was praying for the victims of armed conflict, including the students massacred by Somali gunmen at a university in Kenya. He was also building on his Good Friday denunciation of what he then called 'complicit silence' about the targeting of Christians. 'They are our martyrs of today, and they are many. We can say that they are more numerous than in the first centuries', Pope Francis said. During his address on Monday he praised those who were 'sensitizing public opinion about the persecution of Christians in the world' Pope Francis reaches out to bless the crowd gathered below. He said the international community must not stand 'mute' as Christians having their basic human rights taken away because of their faith. The reflection of the Vatican, where Pope Francis gave his speech, can bee seen in this woman's sunglasses as she films the event. Hundreds flocked to the Holy See of the Catholic church in Rome for the address. Speaking from the window of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican, Pope Francis asked for 'concrete participation and tangible help in defense and protection of our brothers and our sisters, who are persecuted, exiled, slain, beheaded, solely for being Christian.' He added: 'I hope that the international community doesn't stand mute and inert before such unacceptable crimes, which constitute a worrisome erosion of the most elementary human rights. I truly hope that the international community doesn't look the other way.' On Thursday militant Islamist group al-Shabab attacked the Garissa University, killing 148 people. Survivors said the militants spared Muslim students but taunted Christian and Jewish students before killing them. Pope Francis has used his Easter addresses to urge greater protection for Christian communities, after Christian students were killed in an attack on a Kenyan university by militant Islamist group al-Shabab. In Iraq and Syria, the advance of Islamic State group fighters has forced members of ancient Christian communities to flee their homes. Statistics from the International Society for Human Rights show Christians are the victims of 80 per cent of all acts of religious discrimination in the world today. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby hailed the victims of the Kenyan university massacre during his Easter Sunday sermon, adding that Christians must resist without violence the persecution they suffer. This is Pope Francis' third Easter since he was elected in 2011 as the head of the Catholic Church, which has 1.2 billion members worldwide.\n","right_summary":"Pope Francis says Christians coming under increasing number of attacks.

{"document":"A milk price war is set to break out following a landmark decision by the EU to scrap quotas restricting production. A milk price war is set to break out following a landmark decision by the EU to scrap quotas restricting production. The quota system was abolished today after 30 years - allowing dairy farmers to produce as much milk as they like without suffering a financial penalty. The move is expected to drive a spike in production, particularly in countries like Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands, who plan to boost exports of milk and other dairy products to the UK. As a result, a price war over the cost of milk is likely to break out, bringing down the price for consumers. However, British farmers are likely to find the price they are paid by supermarkets is driven down, which will be particularly difficult for smaller family businesses. Milk quotas were introduced in 1984 to address the oversupply during the late 1970s and early 1980s that had led to the infamous milk lakes and butter mountains. Farmers who produced above their quota were hit with punishing cash penalties. The new free-for-all will promote dairy factory farms, where super-size Holstein cows have been bred to produce more milk than any calf could drink in order to cut production costs. The industrialisation of dairy farming has seen the number of UK farms producing milk fall from 50,000 to 14,116 over the last 30 years. At the same time the average herd has risen from 64 cows to 134. The average milk production from Holstein dairy cows, which have been labelled \u2018udders on legs\u2019, has risen by 55per cent to 7,327 litres per animal per year \u2013 around 12,900 pints. In some cases this has been done through selective breeding programmes designed to create supersize cows, which are bulked up with high protein feed and kept inside for much of the year in what are known as \u2018zero grazing\u2019 barns. Dairy farmers have been under severe pressure in the past year as the result of a global glut in milk and a supermarket price war that drove down the price of a pint, making it cheaper than some bottled water. Some dairy processors have starting to raise farm gate prices recently, however farmers remain concerned the end of quotas could bring enormous price swings. Chairman of the dairy board at the National Farmers\u2019 Union, Rob Harrison, has urged all EU countries to act responsibly and collectively in order to manage future volatility. Mr Harrison said: \u2018Farmers and dairy processors here do have some concerns about how other EU countries will react to the ending of quotas. \u2018Some are rapidly increasing their output without an end market for these goods. With milk prices yet to show any strong signs of recovery, this could push farmgate milk prices down further in the EU, and stall any recovery in the dairy markets. \u2018It\u2019s vital that expansion in any Member State is planned in accordance with available market opportunities.\u2019 Dairy farmers have been under severe pressure in the past year as the result of a global glut in milk and a supermarket price war that drove down the price of a pint, making it cheaper than some bottled water. Mr Harrison said the new freedom could allow British dairy farmers, who are particularly efficient, to win new sales in Europe and around the world, particularly the Far East. He said: \u2018We also need UK dairy processors to recognise and promote potential markets both at home and abroad and look to develop new products such as sports drinks.\u2019 The idea of milk being promoted as a sports drink has been given credence by Coca-Cola, which has recently launched its own brand of milk in the United States. The new Fairlife milk costs more than twice as much as regular milk, but the firm believes consumers will pay more on the basis it contains 50per cent more protein and half the sugar. Earlier this week, some European farmer groups mounted a protest over the changes outside the European Parliament in Brussels, which involved a funeral march the lighting of a warning fire. The European Milk Board, a federation of dairy farmers with member organisations from 13 countries, said it was likely that the market would not be able to cope with significantly expanded production in a reasonable way. Its president, Romuald Schaber, said the changes are a particular threat to small dairy farmers, who tend to have higher costs. \u2018Chronic price collapses are inevitable, the next crisis is on its way,\u2019 he said. \u2018Prices will be rock-bottom, as Europe\u2019s farmers will have even less market power to achieve a cost-covering milk price in the future.\u2019 Maria Heubuch, an MEP for the Greens, warned about the loss of small farmers. \u2018Europe could see more factory farms with 1,000, 2,000 or even 5,000 cows, merely providing raw materials for the industry,\u2019 she said. The European Dairy Association, which represents milk processors, has backed the end of quotas. Its Secretary General, Alexander Anton, said: \u2018It goes without saying that the end of the quota will lower the administrative burden on all levels. This will naturally further enhance the competitiveness of the whole sector.\u2019 Irish dairy farmers have embarked on a massive expansion plan and will be looking to make big in-roads to the British market. A study by the Irish Farmers Association (IFA) estimated the ending of quotas would create 9,500 extra jobs in Ireland, and at least 1.3 billion euros (\u00a3950m) in extra exports. While productions restrictions have been scrapped, the EU will provide a safety net for dairy farmers. Brussels will have the power to buy-in butter and skimmed milk powder at a guaranteed figure if there is over-supply, which will shore up the price.\n","right_summary":"Quota system abolished so farmers can produce as much milk as they like.

The new free-for-all has led to a significant increase in production and exports from countries such as Ireland, Germany, and the Netherlands. British farmers have already witnessed a significant increase in prices for their milk products, which helps them stay competitive, despite the initial fear of a potential price war. New brands of milk, such as sports drinks, are now being developed and marketed. Nevertheless, the European Milk Board and small dairy farmers are concerned about the changes as they are at risk of a significant market downturn in the future. However, the European Dairy Association highly praises the end of quotas to encourage enhanced competitiveness in the industry."}

The brief journey included a \u2018half Cuban\u2019 manoeuvre \u2013 a semi loop in mid-air \u2013 after which Harry can be heard to shout: \u2018I\u2019d love to see what my face looked like doing that.\u2019 Breathtaking: Prince Harry, seated in the back of the cockpit, soars past the British coastline in a Spitfire during a sortie last August. Crew: Prince Harry, seated, second from right, with Chris Hadlow, seated left, Steve Boultbee Brooks, second from left, and Phil O'Dell, right. The royal met with Corporal Alan Robinson, standing left, and Nathan Forster, standing right, who won scholarship places. Flight instructor Phil O\u2019Dell, who was with the Prince during his training session, said the 30-minute journey had been \u2018amazing\u2019. \u2018The aircraft has dual control and Harry flew it briefly. He was remarkably down-to-earth, very likeable and I could tell he\u2019s a competent pilot.\u2019 A spokesman for Boultbee Flight Academy added: \u2018It\u2019s a hard aircraft to fly.\u2019 Praising Mr O\u2019Dell, Harry said: \u2018My first landing in a Spitfire \u2013 it was quite good!\u2019 This Spitfire is the same aircraft that will fly the lucky winner of The Mail on Sunday competition on a 20- to 30-minute flight over the English Channel \u2013 worth \u00a32,750 \u2013 later this year. Two thumbs up: The former Apache Helicopter Commander looked relaxed as he took part in the sortie alongside instructor Phil O'Dell. Success: Touching down after the flight, the royal gives a thumbs up and smiles out the window as he says the landing felt 'quite good' Handing over control: The prince enjoyed flying the plane before instructor Phil O'Dell took charge and guided the plane into a loop. Support: The veterans' scholarship was supported Endeavour Fund, which Harry set up alongside his the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Success: Touching down after the flight, the royal gives a thumbs up and smiles out the window as he says the landing felt 'quite good' Thrilling: Footage released today shows the 30-year-old royal howling with excitement as the fighter plane is guided into a loop. A rare cigarette case that once belonged to the designer of the Spitfire fighter aircraft has been anonymously returned to the museum it was stolen from last month. The valuable artefact was posted back to Solent Sky Museum in Southampton, Hampshire, in a jiffy bag with the address scribbled on with Tip-ex. The museum was burgled on March 8 and the case, which belonged to Reginald Joseph Mitchell, was amongst the items stolen. His 'RJM' initials are engraved on the outer case and it was donated to the museum by pilot Jeffrey Quill, one of the foremost Spitfire test pilots and a close friend of Mitchell's.

Honza and Claudine Lafond, from Sydney, have snapped photos of themselves striking impressive yoga poses all over the world - including the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin (pictured) Honza does a balancing act atop her husband in Ubud, Bali. The couple get to grips with each other outside Rome's ancient Colosseum. Honza and Claudine, who married in 2008, share an upside-down kiss in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. According to their website, Honza, who is originally from the Czech Republic, combines\u00a0life-coaching and fitness training in his unique brand of yoga instruction. He writes: 'The challenge that inversions and arm balances offer builds confidence and strength, but more than anything it excites the ever present child within all of us. 'To me, the playful nature of yoga is just as important as its more disciplined aspects. It is the balance between the two that makes yoga a blissful pathway of coming home.' He and his wife Claudine, who was born in New York, specialise in AcroVinyasa, a type of yoga that combines the traditional practice with L-based acrobatic flying. Honza carries Claudine on his feet while lying on a deck on the Hudson River in New York. The couple put a yoga-themed twist on the traditional Leaning Tower of Pisa pose. Claudine flaunts her hard-earned abs as she poses upside-down on Honza's feet and hands in Barcelona. It takes a practiced yogi indeed to pull off Claudine's complex-looking yoga pose.

The Gunners boss and the assembled media break into a fit of laughter following the revelation. 'Per Mertsacker this week is going to give a team talk live around the world,' asked the journalist. 'Is that not the case now before this game?' The bewildered Gunners boss then turns to his press officer off camera who tells Wenger: 'I think that's an April Fools' joke'. 'Ah, I do apologise,' the journalist replies prompting Wenger and the assembled press to collapse into a fit of laughter.

{"document":"Trailing Birmingham City by two goals, Bournemouth were down to fourth in the Championship at one stage in the afternoon but a thrilling four-goal turnaround moved them back to the top. \u2018That\u2019s the madness of it,\u2019 manager Eddie Howe said in the aftermath. \u2018I couldn't believe in one game we dropped to fourth. It\u2019s great for the neutral, but not so great for us.\u2019 The south coast club had not conceded the first goal at Dean Court this campaign and have struggled to get anything from losing positions, but comebacks rarely come better than being two behind after 21 minutes. Charlie Daniels (right) fires home from the edge of the box to seal the win and make it 4-2 to Bournemouth. Yann Kermorgant slots home a penalty to cap a remarkable comeback and make it 3-2 to Bournemouth. BOURNEMOUTH (4-4-2): Boruc; Francis, Cook, Elphick, Daniels; Ritchie, Surman, Arter, Fraser (Smith 56); Kermorgant (Pitman 87), Wilson (Jones 88). Subs not used:\u00a0Camp, Ward, Gosling, Stanislas. Goals: Cook 39, Wilson 45, Kermorgant 48 (pen), Daniels 74. Manager: Eddie Howe. Booked: Wilson, Francis, Smith.

Goals:\u00a0Donaldson 18, Cotterill 21. Manager: Gary Rowett. Booked: Davis, Ground,. Sent off: Robinson (straight red) Referee: Andy Woolmer. Stadium:\u00a0The Goldsands Stadium. Attendance: 11,084. Watford temporarily moved top by beating Middlesbrough, who started the day as leaders, in the lunch-time kick-off and Norwich then went above them with victory against Sheffield Wednesday. But Bournemouth have been this season\u2019s pacesetters and clearly have no intention of stepping aside for the final sprint to the finish line. It did not feel like that, however, when the visitors stunned them with two goals in three minutes. A straightforward ball was played over the top from central midfield by Andrew Shinnie, on 18 minutes, and Clayton Donaldson burst through on goal. Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc started to come from his line then hesitated and before he knew it the striker had sent the ball over him and in. \u2018We want eight,\u2019 the travelling Birmingham supporters chanted in jest, demanding vengeance for Bournemouth thrashing them 8-0 in the reverse of this fixture back in October. That scoreline became less fantastical when they added a second in the 21st minute. Birmingham winger David Cotterill made a strong run down the right and with a defender backing off he buried a strike across goal into the bottom left corner. \u2018That didn\u2019t feel too good,\u2019 Howe admitted. \u2018I\u2019d be lying if I said nerves won\u2019 t come into it, it\u2019s only natural considering what\u2019s at stake.\u2019 But Bournemouth have not got around the automatic qualification places by buckling under pressure and they scored twice before the break. Callum Wilson rounds Birmingham keeper Darren Randolph to draw Bournemouth level. Wilson celebrates his 17th league goal of the season as Bournemouth fight back from two goals down. Steve Cook (centre) battles past a host of Birmingham defenders to score for Bournemouth and make it 2-1. On 39 minutes, Matt Ritchie whipped in a corner from the right-hand side and Tommy Elphick and Steve Cook both leapt for it, the latter eventually bundling the ball over the line. Then in first-half stoppage time Yann Kermorgant played a delicate ball through Birmingham\u2019s defence, perfectly weighted between defender and goalkeeper for Callum Wilson to round Darren Randolph and tap in. Only three minutes into the second half and they were in front. Wilson broke free down the right, carried the ball into the box and was scythed down by Birmingham defender Paul Robinson after a cheeky turn. Kermogant stoked in the penalty. \u2018I felt the officials were inconsistent,\u2019 Birmingham manager Gary Rowett said. 'We had three clear onsides given off and Wilson was level when he won the penalty. Elphick tried to slap Rob Kiernan in a melee at the end and the referee was right next to it but gave nothing.\u2019 If Birmingham\u2019s two goals in three minutes were impressive, Bournemouth\u2019s three in nine were even more devastating and they added to that in the 74th minute. Substitute Adam Smith first had a shot from the edge of the box blocked, which left Randolph on the floor, and the midfielder went for the opposite corner only for the keeper to dive back. But there was nothing Randolph could do when the ball came out to Charlie Daniels who struck a shot into the ground which looped in off the bar. The game was over in the 77th minute when Robinson was sent off for a foul last man. Referee Andy Woolmer handed out a straight red card, but it was hard to make out amongst the Birmingham red faces. David Cotterill celebrates making it 2-0 to Birmingham after just 21 minutes. Clayton Donaldson (centre) opens the scoring for Birmingham with a sublime lob over Artur Boruc. Paul Robinson was shown a red card for a challenge on Wilson after 78 minutes. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe had plenty to smiles about as his side returned to the top of the table.\n","right_summary":"Bournemouth are now one point clear of Norwich at the top of the table.

{"document":"Tara and Gavin Hills, from Kanata, Canada, have been firmly in the anti-vaccination camp, that is until their seven children contracted whooping cough. At first, Mrs Hills thought her kids had a bad cold, but then she heard their deep, booming cough that made them gag and vomit - 'the kind of cough that stops a parent's heart,' she recalled to National Post. After looking up the symptoms online - powerful coughing fits, runny nose, stringy phlegm - the Hills took their ailing brood to the hospital on the morning of April 2. Scroll down for video. Change of heart: Tara and Gavin Hills, have been anti-vaxxers for six years, but all that changed when their seven young children came down with whooping cough. Public confession: Mrs Hills, pictured left and right with her husband, penned a blog post about her decision to ditch the anti-vaxxer stance. Large brood: The Hills' six sons and a daughter between the ages of 10 months and 10 years (pictured) remain in quarantine and are being treated with antibiotics. Four days later, lab tests confirmed whooping cough - an infection of the respiratory system characterized by severe coughing spells, which mainly affects infants and children between the ages of 11 and 18. According to KidsHealth.org, before a vaccine was developed, whooping cough - also known as pertussis - killed up to 10,000 people in the US annually. The introduction of the vaccine has reduced the number of fatalities caused by the infection each year to 30, but in recent years the number of cases has been on the rise. Tara Hills said she and her husband had their first three children partially vaccinated, but then stopped because they have grown suspicious of what she described on her blog, The ScientificParent.com, as the 'Big Pharma-Government-Media conspiracy.' Weary: Tara wrote that she and her husband decided to stop vaccinating their children because they didn't trust the health care system. At risk: The Hills' three eldest kids were partially vaccinated, but the four youngest ones got no shots at all, leaving them vulnerable. 'Were these vaccines even necessary in this day and age?' Mrs Hills wrote. 'Were we unwittingly doing greater harm than help to our beloved children? So much smoke must mean a fire so we defaulted to the \"do nothing and hope nothing bad happens\" position.' The Hills first began questioning their controversial anti-vaxxer stance after hearing of a massive measles outbreak at Disneyland earlier this year. At first, the parents' fear of contagion proved weaker than their mistrust of the medical system. But then Tara and her husband started looking at information from government agencies and reputable health organizations. In an ironic twist - one of many in the story of the Hills' evolution as anti-vaxxers - their children have been scheduled to get their first shots soon when whooping cough struck, reported CTV News. 'I looked again at the science and evidence for community immunity and found myself gripped with a very real sense of personal and social responsibility before God and man,\u2019 Tara Hills wrote on her blog, adding that one of her main concerns was that her kids may have infected her sister's unvaccinated infant. The Hills' youngest children are still battling the illness, but are expected to recover. Her six sons and a daughter ranging in age from 10 months to 10 years have been ordered to remain in quarantine at their house in Kanata until they stop being contagious, which will take five days. On Thursday, Mrs Hills said her two eldest children have turned a corner and are now on the mend, while the younger kids are still battling the illness with the help of antibiotics. In her blog post titled Learning the Hard Way: My Journey from #AntiVaxx to Science, which has been viewed more than 2million times, Hills acknowledged the awkward position she has found herself in. 'I\u2019m writing this from quarantine, the irony of which isn\u2019t lost on me,' she wrote. 'I am not looking forward to any gloating or shame as this 'defection' from the antivaxx camp goes public, but this isn't a popularity contest. Right now my family is living the consequences of misinformation and fear.'\n","right_summary":"Tara and Gavin Hills, from Canada, stopped vaccinating their children six years ago after losing trust in the health care system.

{"document":"A Utah man is thankful he is alive after he claims a Delta Airlines plane flew over his home when a large chunk of ice dropped from the aircraft shattering his car's windshield. Todd Larson, 55, told Daily Mail Online he had parked his collectible Dodge Challenger worth $30,000 in the driveway of his Taylorsville home on March 25 when moments later an ice chunk crashed\u00a0onto his car at 1.53am. 'It hit so hard that four or five neighbors' car alarms went off,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'It missed going through my roof by only inches and if I had stayed in the car and answered by son\u2019s message about picking him up, that piece of ice would have gone right through my chest.' Todd Larson said a chunk of ice fell from a plan smashing through the windshield of his Dodge Challenger parked at his Taylorsville, Utah home (above his damaged Dodge Challenger) He said the FAA did an investigation and found an A1 aircraft that matched within two minutes of the time the incident happened and when the plane was flying above his home. Mr Larson said two minutes later at 1.55am he called police to file the report of the ice chunk falling through his car's windshield, which he believes came from a Delta Airlines A1 aircraft. He earlier told Fox 13 there were four Delta Air Line flights in the area when the incident occurred, according to a representative for the Federal Aviation Administration. On Friday afternoon, Mr Larson told Daily Mail Online that the FAA did an investigation and learned that on March 26 an aircraft within two minutes of the time of incident was in the area above his home. 'The investigator cannot give me the flight number but the time it happened matched within two minutes that the plane was overhead,' he said. 'What caught my attention was that as he turned the plane and put his spoiler down, you could hear the engine change, and I looked up and saw that it was a Delta plane. 'Then I heard a huge crash which sounded like a major car accident.' Mr Larson said the hole in his windshield is about 12.5 inches in length and that the size of the piece of ice that went through was the size of a cinder block. 'The pieces that broke up were the size of a grapefruit and the smaller ones were the size of golf balls,' he told Daily Mail Online. Mr Larson has already paid the $4,000 in repairs which included $400 for the windshield and additional costs for replacing his Bluetooth, emergency phone and electric power seat with a heater that were all damaged in the incident. 'When you\u2019re retired and you have to take that big chunk of money out it makes a big difference in what you can do,' he said. 'You try and stay on a budget and you find a car that you really wanted and it\u2019s damaged in this way. 'My insurance says yes they\u2019ll fix it, but my agent explained to me what happens and told me to call FAA, and said if I didn\u2019t make a claim my car would be worthless so I\u2019m at Catch-22. 'I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t admit what they did.' Mr Larson said the chunks of ice ranged in size from grapefruits to golf balls (above the chunks of ice following the incident) He said the hole in his windshield is about 12.5 inches in length and that the glass was shattered into a fine powder. Mr Larson said that he has contacted Delta Airlines and the person in charge of the aircraft has not returned his calls. He said they are meant to respond within ten working days, and that after giving them 15, he is left fed up. 'They don\u2019t want to recognize it as their mistake that something happened from their plane,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'One of the people who did the preliminary investigation explained that if it was a part or a panel they are responsible, but ice is an \"act of God\" or cause of nature. 'I said it could be a malfunction in the plane and they won\u2019t recognize that or give me a call back. 'I want them to admit that it was their fault.' Daily Mail Online calls to Delta Airlines on Friday were not immediately returned. Mr Larson said he wants Delta Airlines to admit the chunk of ice came from their aircraft. On Friday, he told Daily Mail Online he had not had calls returned from the person in charge of the airbus. An incident similar to Larson's occurred earlier this year, when large pieces of ice slammed down into a man's Chicago living room and bedroom, causing destruction including a massive hole in his ceiling. John Connors said apart from his cat Oscar being left scared, who was uninjured during the incident in January, if he had been home he would have been killed. 'I walked in and it looked like a bomb had exploded up in here,' Connors told WLS. At the time, pilot Scott Batzel told Lake View Patch that he thought the ice dropped through Connors' apartment because of a plane flying overhead. Batzel said: 'There\u2019s a slight possibility the ice-ball fell from an airplane. It\u2019s not a common occurrence but it does happen from time to time. 'It\u2019s very likely that many arriving airplanes were operating in that vicinity.' He added: 'Some airplanes use potable water to flush the lavatory toilets. 'Normally the flushed waste is collected in a storage tank but if the tank was leaking, ice could have built up on the outside of the plane and eventually broke free.' In January, John Connors (pictured above with his cat Oscar) experienced a similar incident when ice pummeled through his Chicago apartment leaving his cat Oscar scared  and a massive hole in his ceiling.\n","right_summary":"Todd Larson, 55, of Taylorsville, Utah claims Delta A1 aircraft flew over his home dropping ice chunk smashing his Dodge Challenger's windshield.

{"document":"The police officer accused of murdering Walter Scott will be banned from seeing his first-born child for several months, it was revealed today. Patrol officer Michael Slager will be refused the right to hold the baby which his wife Jamie is set to give birth to in a few weeks. He is only granted video access to his eight and a half month's pregnant wife and an officer stands outside the booth whenever he talks to his family. They are not allowed to spend any time together and contact is via video screens with headphones at the Charleston County jail. But the baby will not be able to enter the South Carolina prison. Before the fall: Patrolman Michael Slager, 33, with his wife Jamie before his arrest. Slager was charged with murder after shooting Walter Scott, 50, after stopping him over a broken tail light in North Charleston, South Carolina. Visit: Michael Slager received a visit at Charleston County Jail last Friday from his pregnant wife and mom. It is deemed unsafe for an infant to enter the prison so Slager will have to rely on photographs as cell phones and access to the internet is forbidden. He will be informed by a telephone call and have to wait to see photographs, which will be examined by officials before being presented to him. When Jamie attended the jail on Friday, she was made to turn through the prison's reception area and take a seat next to a video screen for a talk with him which lasted around two hours. The booths are protected by screens to prevent onlookers from seeing inmates, but appointments have to made in advance. Relatives of other prisoners queued to use the video booths after registering with prison officials behind thick glass security screens as Jamie and her accused husband talked with the aid of headphones. But their first child together will not be allowed to visit him in prison until jail chiefs decide that the baby's health would not be at risk from being there. Although there is no specific age limit, prison policy is not to allow babies in. No date has yet been set for his first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away. Major Eric Watson of the Charleston County Sheriff's Office told Daily Mail Online: 'He is treated just like any other prisoner, except for being in protective custody. 'His baby won't be coming to the prison and he will not be allowed to see the child. It could be several months before he does. 'His attorney can apply for the baby to be brought to the jail if he wants.' Walter Scott was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen. Family tell says the light was an accessory and both mandatory stop lamps were functioning. Slager, 33, already has two step children from his wife's previous marriage, but the new baby will be the first for him and Jamie. Major Watson said Slager had no access to the internet and was under close scrutiny to deter any threat from angry prisoners over the shooting of Walter,who was gunned down by the officer after being stopped for an apparent faulty tail light on his Mercedes. Walter's supporters and family say he was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen and this was wrong because the light was an accessory and both his obligatory stop lamps were functioning. Major Watson said Slager was being offered three meals a day and recreation time, but was isolated from other inmates.

One released prisoner said outside the gates: 'Man, it ain't no holiday being in there. He has to watch his back more than most because of what he did. There's a lot of angry men in there, black and white.' Walter's brother Anthony said police faced 'many questions' about traffic stops based on racial profiling and that his brother's death should serve as a catalyst for a change in police policies. Meanwhile, the man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton. No date has yet been set for Slager's first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away. The mystery man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton. The 30-year-old was detained by police as Walter fled his Mercedes Benz before dying in a hail of bullets and later released. Pierre's family said they had no idea why he was in the car and how he came to be friends with the shooting victim. His grand mother Eunice Fulton, 70, said: 'I spoke with my daughter Franetta on Thursday and Pierre had only just told her he was in the car. 'It was a terrible incident but we haven't had the chance to speak to him about it. He used to live with me until a couple of years ago. But I don't where he hangs out now. He moves around.' Pierre, who was known to police, had stayed in the background since Walter was shot by officer Michael Slager and at the weekend rejected media requests for interviews. He has given a full statement to investigators, but police refused to reveal his name and what he has told them. He had requested privacy. Pierre was caught on the policeman's dash cam after Walter had fled and been shot. But police released him without charge and he was not suspected of any crime. He has convictions for unlawfully carrying a pistol and served 174 days in prison in 2005 and has been arrested several times. His grandmother added: 'He is a good grandson. He cares for his family. But I don't know what he is doing now.' Pierre has worked as a cleaner, laundry man and warehouseman over the years, but some members of his family have lost touch with him. Rosanne Grant of Alternative Staffing employment agency told Daily Mail Online: ' He worked at various jobs over the period of a year through me. The last time I hear about him was in 2006 and nothing since. I don't know what he has been working at.'\n","right_summary":"Officer Michael Slager is being held at Charleston County jail accused of murdering Walter Scott, shooting him eight times in the back.

{"document":"A mass doggy wedding saw more than 40 pooches, complete with tulle wedding dresses and celebrity guests, tie the knot in a park in Beijing on Sunday. The collective ceremony, which was billed the first of its kind to be held in China, was organised by a new social media app designed for pets. A traditional wedding march played as the love-struck pooches were led down the aisle by their owners to \u2018exchange vows\u2019 and receive marriage certificates, according to the\u00a0People\u2019s Daily Online. Love-struck pooches were led up the aisle by owners to \u2018exchange vows\u2019 and receive marriage certificates. Canine couples arrived in BMW convertibles and, in one case, a stretch Hummer limousine. Forty-two dogs tied the knot at the wedding, which is complete with tulle wedding dresses and celebrity owners. No expense was spared for the special occasion, as the 21 canine couples arrived in BMW convertibles and a stretch Hummer limousine. Organisers set up lavish flower arches and banquet tables in the park, where the couples showed off their outfits. One pet owner who attended the wedding, Ms Li, said: \u2018I have attended many weddings before, but this is the first time I've ever been to such a large scale collective pet wedding. \u2018Looking at these lovely pets getting married and listening to their stories, I was really moved.\u2019 One owner said this was the first collective pet wedding for her and she was really moved by the scene. Organisers said the wedding was designed to\u00a0give pets and their owners a day to remember. The ceremony was also designed to\u00a0raise awareness of animal rights, said the organiser. Organiser Zhang Zhongsham, CEO of pet social media app Smack Talk, said the event was designed not only to give pets and their owners a day to remember, but also to raise awareness of animal rights. He said: \u2018The idea of a collective wedding came about from our previous communication and research with users. \u2018This is our first try and we want to take the opportunity to continually promote the development of the pet industry, improve the social lives of our pets and allow them to enjoy egalitarian treatment to that of mankind.\u2019 Among the guests were Chinese Olympic gymnast and gold medallist Teng Haibin, who married off his pet. The organiser Smack Talk, which is available in Simplified Chinese on iPhone and Android, allows pets to have their own social media profile page and aims to get pets \u2018speaking\u2019 via their owners. The app has gained millions of users in three months. Chinese Olympic gymnast and gold medallist Teng Haibin (centre) also married off his pet.

{"document":"An unemployed 32-stone woman receives \u00a318,000 a year in benefits because she claims her weight-related illness makes her a danger to the public. Morbidly obese Rochelle Coulson suffers from sleep apnoea - a condition often linked to obesity - which she says leaves her so tired that she falls asleep unexpectedly. The 21-year-old, who put on 13 stone in four years by eating through 'boredom', has not worked for five years because she says she would be a 'danger' in the workplace. Pressure group the Taxpayers' Alliance has now warned that the benefit system should not become a 'comfort blanket' and that people should 'get themselves in shape' to work. Scroll down for video. Morbidly obese Rochelle Coulson (left and right) claims \u00a318,000 in benefits because she suffers from sleep apnoea - a condition often linked to excessive weight - which leaves her so tired that she can't stay awake. Ms Coulson told MailOnline: 'I can't work because of my condition. If I was sat in an office, I would just fall asleep and the manager will end up sacking me. 'It's not just that, but I could make something go wrong, couldn't I? By falling asleep and making a mistake. Who knows what buttons I would press or what would happen? It wouldn't be fair on my colleagues.' Doctors have now warned Ms Coulson that she needs to lose weight to cure her condition - but she says she needs a state-funded support worker to write her meal plans. Instead, she continues to claim \u00a318,712 a year in benefits - the equivalent of a \u00a322,000 taxable salary - which is more than a nurse's starting wage and the same pay as a newly-qualified teacher. She added: 'I would love to have a job, I didn't chose to be like this. But I can't. I'm too dangerous. I can't do anything if I'm falling asleep the whole time.' Ms Coulson, who lives alone in New Milton, Hampshire, said she has always battled with her weight. However, her weight spiralled out of control after she left home four years ago. Unable to get a job due to being signed off with depression, the young woman started eating up to ten packs of crisps per day because she was 'bored'. She would also have an evening takeaway - and had soon put on 13 stone. Ms Coulson, pictured with her mother Lynda, 50, says she would like to work if she were able to do so. Doctors have now warned Ms Coulson that she needs to lose weight to cure her condition - but she says she can only do that with a state-funded support worker to help her write meal plans. She said: 'I developed depression and that just made me eat more. I would have takeaways most nights. I ate a lot, including chocolate and crisps. It was a way of coping.' Sleep apnoea is a condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, which interrupts normal breathing and can stop someone getting a decent night's sleep. Ms Coulson, who is 5ft 6in, claims the condition leaves her so tired that she cannot travel to work, incase she drifts off to sleep and misses her bus stop. She also says she is not allowed to drive incase she nods off at the wheel. Rochelle Coulson is entitled to a raft of benefits every month which means she has not had to work for five years. Every month she is entitled to:. Total: \u00a318, 712. The 21-year-old is supposed to use a Continuous Positive Air Pressure machine (CPAP) to help her sleep during the night. But she decided not to use it because she claims she cannot travel to the doctors for a check-up. She has also been offered\u00a0half-price gym membership by the NHS to help her lose weight - but says she cannot use it because it is too painful to walk. Despite this, Ms Coulson says the NHS could be doing a lot more to help her. She said: 'Yes I do feel there is more out there to help me and the NHS could have done better. 'They haven't done enough to help me tackle my weight. It would be nice to have a check-up each week, or month, when me and the doctor sit down and write a meal plan. Or they could try and get me a support worker. 'I am supposed to have a CPAP machine to help but I do not use it because I can't get back to hospital for a check-up. 'I can't go to hospital because I can't go on public transport as I will fall asleep and my mum can't always be there with me. I can't drive either because of my condition.' Ms Coulson said she started applying for jobs when she first finished college at the age of 18. But she was soon diagnosed with depression and told she was not capable of working. In December 2012, she was then diagnosed with sleep apnoea. Now, she claims she can drop off to sleep unexpectedly for up to six hours per day, meaning she relies on repeat sick notes to claim her state handouts. But in June last year, Ms Coulson was struck off from a GP surgery when her mother Lynda, 50, asked for a three-month note which the doctor refused. When the doctor offered to give her a one-month note instead, the pair were banned for being 'verbally abusive'.\u00a0Ms Coulson then had to be 'interviewed' before being rejected by another surgery. In November, she was finally signed off for five months, after signing up to her third GP. The 21-year-old, who spends her days playing on Facebook, has not had a job for five years because she says she cannot stay awake. This healthy meal of carrots, potatoes, chicken and salad, recently posted by Ms Coulson, is an alternative to her usual takeaways and crisps. In total, Ms Coulson gets \u00a3411 in Personal Independence Payment a month, as well as \u00a3260 Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) a fortnight. Her \u00a3135 a week rent is also covered through housing benefit. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'The benefit system is a valuable safety net, and those with genuine conditions must of course be caught by it, but it can never become a comfort blanket and we must ask individuals to get themselves in shape to work. 'Taxpayers cannot afford to support individuals who simply choose not to work, so the authorities must be strict about who is deemed 'fit to work' or not. Ultimately, the benefit system has to encourage people to take responsibility for themselves.' Ms Coulson is now trying to lose weight by swapping her takeaways for healthy alternatives. She hopes that by losing some weight that she will be able to become more active. Nurse starting salary: \u00a321,388. This job requires students to complete a three-year degree at university. Nurses then work a complex shift pattern, including weekends, evenings and nights. Teacher starting salary: \u00a322,023. This requires the person to complete an undergraduate degree - usually three years long - and a one-year PGCE. Alternatively, the trainee teacher can complete an intensive year-long school-centred initial teacher training course on the job (SCITT). Care home worker: Between \u00a314,000 and \u00a318,000. This usually requires someone to complete a diploma in health and social care, as well as to undertake training and courses while on the job. She said: 'At the moment, it's hard for me to do everyday things like getting out of bed. The hardest is getting out of my mum's couch. It hurts my hips to lift myself out, because the sofa is broken due to my weight. 'My back also can't cope with standing for too long because of my weight, which means it very painful to walk.' She added: 'I'm dropping things like crisps and chocolate and replacing it with low fat Greek yoghurt. I used to eat takeaways on a regular basis but now I don't. 'Once I've shifted some, I can hopefully get out a little more.' Ms Coulson also said she had a blood test last week which showed she is borderline diabetic and has an underactive thyroid, for which she is now taking medication. A DWP spokesman said: 'Being obese in itself does not entitle a person to disability benefits, although the associated long-term health effects may. 'Decisions on whether a person is entitled to disability benefits are based on thorough assessments and consideration of any medical evidence, including from their GP.'\n","right_summary":"Rochelle Coulson, from New Milton, gets\u00a0equivalent\u00a0to \u00a322k taxable salary.

{"document":"Panama City Beach, Florida (CNN)A third person has been arrested in the case of an alleged spring break gang rape that was videotaped on a crowded stretch of Panama City Beach, the Bay County, Florida, Sheriff's Office said Wednesday. Police arrested the suspect at 11 p.m. Tuesday. \"After developing information that George Davon Kennedy was the third suspect seen in the video of the gang rape, BCSO Investigators obtained a warrant for his arrest,\" according to a news release. Investigators discovered that Kennedy had family in DeKalb County, Georgia, and reached out to the sheriff's office there. Deputies in DeKalb, in the Atlanta area, tracked down Kennedy and arrested him on a charge of sexual assault by multiple perpetrators, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said. Kennedy is from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and has been a student at Middle Tennessee State University, the sheriff's office said. Previously, Ryan Calhoun and Delonte Martistee were arrested and charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators, the sheriff's office said. Calhoun was released Saturday after posting $50,000 bond; Martistee remains in Bay County Jail, a county deputy said. Troy University in Alabama said the two are students and have been \"placed on temporary suspension from school per the university's standards of conduct and disciplinary procedures. Martistee, a member of the track and field team, has also been removed from the team.\" Martistee is represented by a public defender. Calhoun's legal representation is unclear. No public statement has been made on either's behalf. The arrests come after a woman told police she may have been drugged and gang-raped on a beach behind a popular club in broad daylight as bystanders watched. The woman didn't recall the assault, police say, but she saw the video of her alleged assault on the news, and though the footage had to be blurred, she recognized her tattoos and contacted authorities. It's not the first time this has happened to a young woman in Panama City Beach, authorities say. Four young men were involved in the assault, Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said, and while he previously said federal marshals were trying to track down a third suspect and investigators were seeking a possible witness, it's unclear if the person arrested Tuesday was someone the police had been looking for. \"There's hundreds, hundreds of people standing there -- watching, looking, seeing, hearing what's going on,\" McKeithen said. \"And yet our culture and our society and our young people have got to the point where obviously this is acceptable somewhere. I will tell you it is not acceptable in Bay County.\" Authorities have said they plan to interview the woman and show her the full video to see whether she knows the attackers and can help identify other suspects, said Ruth Corley, spokeswoman for the sheriff's office. Authorities are pressing charges, and the woman plans to cooperate, Corley said. Investigators were to meet with her this week. After interviewing witnesses, Bay County investigators determined the alleged rape took place between March 10 and March 12, behind Spinnaker Beach Club, a popular bar and dance club for spring breakers. She \"does not remember the assault at all,\" Corley said. \"She remembers taking a drink from a CamelBak and there is a strong possibility she was drugged.\" (CamelBak sells various products for transporting water or other drinks.) She was visiting Panama City Beach at the time of the assault, and is now home, authorities said. The Troy, Alabama, Police Department found the video during the course of an investigation into an unrelated shooting and turned it over to the Bay County Sheriff's Office. The video shows suspects pushing the victim's hand aside and holding her legs down, Corley said. \"You can see in the video there are people two feet away. They were assaulting her, and we believe the people around her knew she was being assaulted.\" The suspects can be heard commenting about what they are doing to her, Corley said. Authorities have three sworn statements from witnesses stating that the assault happened, Corley said. The sheriff's office released part of the video to local TV stations, which blurred portions of it before airing. CNN is showing part of what was released. While the video is \"one of the most disgusting, repulsive, sickening things that I've seen this year on Panama City Beach,\" it's not an isolated incident, McKeithen said. \"This is not the first video we've recovered. It's not the second video. It's not the third video. There's a number of videos we've recovered with things similar to this, and I can only imagine how many things we haven't recovered.\" Corley said that through social media, \"we have been able to find video of girls, incoherent and passed out, and almost like they are drugged, being assaulted on the beaches of Panama City in front of a bunch of people standing around.\" About 100,000 spring break revelers come to the beach community every year. This year, the Bay County Sheriff's Office made more than 1,000 arrests for various crimes -- about triple the number of arrests made in the same period last year. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Josh Levs and Alexandra Field contributed to this report.\n","right_summary":"Third suspect identified as George Davon Kennedy of Murfreesboro, Tennessee.

{"document":"For the fifth year in a row in 2014, ambush attacks on police officers were the No. 1 cause of felonious deaths of law enforcement officers in the line of duty. Nevertheless, Google continues to market a smartphone application that lets lawbreakers pinpoint the location of police officers in the field. Google's executives won't even discuss the subject with organizations representing law enforcement. Google's popular real-time traffic app, Waze, uses GPS navigation and crowdsourcing to alert users to traffic jams, automobile accidents, stalled cars, and through its \"traffic cop\" feature, the presence of law enforcement. Most people undoubtedly use Waze's police-finding feature to avoid traffic tickets, but the app poses an enormous risk to deputies and police officers. In the days before he assassinated New York police officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu at point blank range while they sat in their patrol car last December, Ismaaiyl Brinsley is known to have used the Waze application to monitor the movements of police officers. The killer identified the location of police on his own Waze account and even posted screen captures to Instagram. While Google (which acquired Waze in 2013 for a reported $1.1 billion) claims the app \"is all about contributing to the 'common good' out there on the road,\" the risks far outweigh the potential benefits. Every day, thousands of police officers and deputies enforce traffic laws, execute arrest and search warrants, investigate domestic violence complaints and perform countless tasks that are needed to keep our neighborhoods safe and remove criminals from the streets. It takes just a couple of clicks on Waze's \"traffic cop\" icon to identify their locations and indicate whether -- in the opinion of the anonymous user -- the officer is \"visible\" or \"invisible.\" At that moment, the officer or deputy becomes an identifiable target whose whereabouts are available to any one of Waze's 50 million users worldwide. Social media has made enormous contributions to law enforcement as a \"force multiplier\" that lets citizens help police protect our communities. As we have seen with the emergence of crimes like identity theft, however, technology has the potential for evil as well as good. In the case of Waze, we are confronted with a tool that can be lethal to police officers and deputies, whose roles in society are to protect our citizens and enforce the laws that keep our communities safe. Google, whose stated mission is \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,\" is now marketing an app with the potential to obstruct law enforcement and put the lives of police officers and deputies at risk. Even the more benign uses of Waze's \"traffic cop\" feature are concerning. In 2013, 10,076 people were killed in alcohol-related automobile accidents. And in 2011, 9,944 people lost their lives in speed-related fatal crashes. Is the highest, best use of Google's geo-mapping and crowdsourcing capabilities to help drunk drivers avoid checkpoints and give speeders assistance in evading speed limits? It's not just the speeders and drunk drivers who have access to the locations of police officers through Google's technology. Perpetrators of domestic violence can use it to find out about the presence of law enforcement in a spouse's neighborhood; gang members, narcotics dealers, even those intent on perpetrating an act of terror, all have access to Waze's \"traffic cop\" feature. Google has built a solid reputation as a good corporate neighbor, tying for first place in a 2013 study by the Reputation Institute measuring companies' reputations for corporate social responsibility. The company makes much of its compliance with legal, moral and ethical obligations as a good corporate neighbor. But when it comes to Waze, Google has gone into a defensive crouch. The company's executives flat out refused to discuss the subject with representatives of the National Sheriffs' Association, an organization representing more than 3,000 sheriff's offices across the United States. The refusal of Google's executives to even dignify our concerns by meeting with us offends our conscience. If Google's real objective is the \"common good out there on the road,\" it will work with us to ensure the safety of both motorists and police officers. The goals are not mutually exclusive: we can have both.\n","right_summary":"David A. Clarke Jr. and Jonathan Thompson: Why does Google have an app that ambushes police? With Waze, we are confronted with a tool that can be lethal to police officers and deputies.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Google is actively promoting an app that endangers the safety of law enforcement officers by allowing users to report their locations in real-time, which has been linked to several instances of targeted attacks on police officers."}
{"document":"The mortgage market has reached a \u2018watershed\u2019 moment with the launch of the first five-year fixed rate below 2 per cent. The battle between lenders has intensified in recent months, plunging home loan rates to their lowest in history. But the mortgage wars will erupt again next week after HSBC announced a 1.99 per cent interest rate on a five-year fix. Experts said it was the cheapest ever deal of its kind and described the move as \u2018astonishing\u2019. New low:\u00a0The mortgage market has reached a \u2018watershed\u2019 moment with the launch of the first five-year fixed rate below 2 per cent. The offer from one of the country\u2019s biggest mortgage lenders \u2013 HSBC is consistently in the top five \u2013 launches on Monday and is expected to trigger a flood of rate cuts by other banks and building societies. Fifteen lenders had already cut rates across their ranges in the past week, but more are likely to follow now HSBC has set a new benchmark. Brokers said lenders appeared to be slashing rates ready for the \u2018spring mortgage spree\u2019 when many families move or remortgage. Mortgage broker Andrew Montlake, of Coreco, said: \u2018The breaking of the 2 per cent barrier for a five-year fix is a watershed moment and one many thought would never be seen in the UK. \u2018Other lenders will now look to compete, but there is only so low they can go before their profit margins start to become too squeezed. \u2018The current crop of low fixed rates could help to spur more borrowers into action as they lock\u00a0in before these rates disappear.\u2019 HSBC already had one of the lowest five-year fixes on the market at 2.19 per cent, but decided to under-cut itself to try to steal more customers from its rivals. The only cheaper deal was offered by TSB at 2.09 per cent, but it was available only on loans over \u00a3200,000 and for those remortgaging, and carried a fee of \u00a31,995. With the HSBC rate cut from 2.19 per cent to 1.99 per cent, a homeowner borrowing \u00a3200,000 over a 25-year term would save more than \u00a31,100 during the five-year deal. The offer is available only to those with a deposit of at least 40 per cent, with a \u00a31,499 fee. Other than the usual affordability criteria, there are no other restrictions. The battle between lenders has intensified in recent months, plunging home loan rates to their lowest in history. Mortgage broker David Hollingsworth, of London and Country, said: \u2018This is an astonishing low rate for a five-year fixed rate and certainly moves the market on again after a recent lull. They are laying down a marker for other lenders.\u2019 The mortgage war has erupted six years after the Bank of England slashed its base rate to a historic low of 0.5 per cent to try to boost economic growth during the financial crisis. Recent economic growth had prompted speculation that interest rates could rise this year. But, with the inflation rate at zero, analysts believe the rate is unlikely to rise until the middle of 2016. This has allowed lenders to offer even cheaper fixed-rate mortgages with more confidence. Charlotte Nelson, at Moneyfacts, said: \u2018This 1.99 per cent deal is the first five-year fixed-rate mortgage to be launched below 2 per cent. \u2018The competition to be the lowest in the mortgage market shows no signs of stopping and is great news for borrowers.\u2019 The average rate on a five-year fixed rate on offer, across all deposits, is now 3.55 per cent, compared to 4.04 per cent a year ago. Five years ago, the average five-year fixed rate was 5.87 per cent. Increased competition from new banks such as TSB and Virgin has forced major banks and building societies to compete harder, according to experts.

The preserved remains were discovered in a cardboard box by street cleaners in north-western Peru. The mummy, thought to date back to 1100 AD, was found wrapped in rope and dumped inside the box in front of an archaeological dig in the city of Trujillo. Scroll down for video. Grim discovery: Street cleaners who found the remains initially feared they had stumbled across a murder victim. It is thought to have been stolen from the archaeological site known as Chan Chan which was the capital of the Chimu Empire, an urban civilisation that appeared on the Peruvian coast around 1100 AD. The discovery was made in the early hours of the morning as the cleaners swept up the streets close to the dig. Cleaner Otilio Padilla Miramontes, 54, said: 'It looked just like any other box dumped on the streets. Well preserved: It turned out the 'victim' was in fact a stolen, 915-year-old Peruvian mummy.

A police spokesman said: 'We quickly established that this was not a recent skeleton. 'But we are now investigating how it ended up in a box outside of the main archaeological site. 'Our suspicion is that someone tried to steal it and had maybe left it in the box to collect later.' The remains were taken to the regional Directorate of Culture for examination.

{"document":"When high-energy electrons and ions from the sun hit Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere, they can excite atoms and create fantastic colours - which we see on the ground as auroras. And now a study has claimed that we could create our own auroras, by firing a particle accelerator into the sky from space. The intriguing research says that a beam fired from the machine would create artificial auroras \u00a0\u2013 and it could even create lightning in the atmosphere. Scientists in California have described how to create artificial auroras on Earth. They said a particle accelerator could be sent 185 miles (300km) up into space (illustration of a satellite in orbit shown). It would then fire high-energy beams back at Earth's atmosphere. The study, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, was picked up by Mark Zastrow from Eos. The accelerator being proposed would be three times stronger than anything like it before, producing a beam with particles 0.5 to 10 million electron volts. Pulses of the beam would last just 0.1 microseconds. The accelerator would be located in space, 185 miles (300km) above the ground, and would fire back towards Earth's atmosphere. There are two types of auroras on Earth - the Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere, known as the Northern Lights, and the Aurora Australis in the Southern Hemisphere, known as the Southern Lights. Auroras occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles (32 to 320km) above the planet\u2019s surface. The interactions between the charged particles give off light. Auroral displays appear in many colours: red, yellow, green, blue, and violet. The color of the aurora depends on which atom is struck, and the altitude of the meeting. The common green hue is caused by colliding oxygen molecules at altitudes of up to 150 miles (240km). It would be based on a instrument called the Compact Particle Accelerator for Space Science (Compass), which is being developed by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and SRI International, both in California. \u2018The authors say that employing such instrumentation would offer many scientific opportunities to study the behaviour of particles in the upper atmosphere,\u2019 wrote Mr Zastrow. \u2018The paths of the electrons would trace out the arcing field lines of Earth\u2019s magnetic field, illustrating how they bend and snap during the intense geomagnetic activity caused by solar storms. \u2018As they descend into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, some of the electrons would strike atmospheric molecules, producing visible aurora-like emission.\u2019 He added that the beam might even be able to trigger different forms of lightning, including red sprites and blue jets. For now the idea is only a concept, and there are no concrete plans to build it. But the team says that by proving it works, it could be a step towards actually making it. There are two types of auroras on Earth - the Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere, known as the Northern Lights, and the Aurora Australis in the Southern Hemisphere, known as the Southern Lights. Shown is the Aurora Borealis above the\u00a0Snaefellsnes Peninsula in Iceland. It would not be the first experiment with Earth\u2019s atmosphere, though. In Alaska there is an ionospheric research programmed called the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (Haarp). Haarp is jointly funded by the US Air Force, the US Navy, the University of Alaska, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). It was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance.

{"document":"A pair of turkey-sized \u2018egg thief lizards\u2019 dubbed Romeo and Juliet were found lying next to each other in a 75-million-year-old rock in the mid-90s, but it has taken until now for experts to determine the sex of the 'lovers'. Now, researchers believe they have come up with a way to tell fossils of small feathered male dinosaurs from those of females. They say that the key differences between the sexes lie in bones near the base of the tail. A pair of turkey-sized \u2018egg thief lizards\u2019 dubbed Romeo and Juliet were found lying next to each other in a 75-million-year-old rock (pictured) in the mid-90s. Palaeontologists led by\u00a0Scott Persons (pictured) believe they can tell males and females apart from certain tail bones. Paleontologistsat the University of Alberta examined a pair of fossils found in Mongolia, which were first described in 2001. One is a complete skeleton, while the other is missing the middle and end of its tail. \u2018Determining a dinosaur\u2019s gender is really hard,\u2019 said graduate student Scott Persons, who is lead author of the study, published in Scientific Reports. \u2018Because soft anatomy seldom fossilises, a dinosaur fossil usually provides no direct evidence of whether it was a male or a female.\u2019 So instead, the researchers looked at indirect evidence of sexually dimorphic display structures, which are evident today in birds. Examples include the fans of peacocks, the tall crests of roosters or the long tail feathers of some birds of paradise, which are used to attract and court mates. They are almost always much larger in males who do the courting, than in females, who do the choosing. They suggest that male oviraptors had broader and longer chevron bones in their tails so they could shake their feather-tipped tail to woo potential mates (illustrated), much like modern peacocks. The team theorised that like birds, small feathered dinosaurs such as oviraptors used long feathers on their tails to attract mates, rather than for flying. \u2018My analysis of the tail skeletons supported this theory, because the skeletons showed adaptations for both high tail flexibility and enlarged tail musculature - both traits that would have helped an oviraptor to flaunt its tail fan in a mating dance,\u2019 Mr Persons said. After studying the fossils carefully, his team found signs of sexual dimorphism in the length and shape of blade-like bones called chevrons, which point downwards from the vertebrae near the base of the tail. A number of chevrons in one of the fossils were longer and had broader tips than those in the other specimen, indicating the creature is male, the experts said. They suggested that males had larger chevrons to anchor the muscles that controlled their flexible, feather-tipped tails. The researchers suspect that male oviraptorosaurs shook their tail feathers in intricate displays to woo potential mates, akin the behaviour of modern-day peacocks. They suspect females had shorter chevrons to make laying eggs easier. Scientists have recently shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Their mating ritual may bear some resemblance to that of small feathered dinosaurs. Scientists have shown that peacocks (stock image) shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate. Researchers at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, have shown that the birds make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails and that other peacocks respond to them. Humans hear a rustling sound when this happens, but the experts found that the birds hear a loud sound of between 70 and 108 decibels, according to the study published in the journal Animal Behaviour. Male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers, with males shrieking out in response. Experts are unsure how the birds detect infrasound, but know that some can feel vibration through their legs. Graduate student Angela Freeman observed that male peacocks were most likely to make the low sounds when they showed off their train feathers, producing two displays which she called the \u2018shiver train\u2019 and the \u2018pulse train\u2019. The shiver train is produced by vibration of the train feathers from the centre feathers to the outside of the array and is used by males when females are far away. The pulse train is produced by a vibration emanating from the base of all the train feathers and it is used when the female is nearby. Peacocks\u2019 tails are a sign of strength and good genes, so a strong noise may reinforce a message of virility, Ms Freeman said. This could be especially useful as the birds live in scrubby woodland, where high noises can only travel over short distances and birds sometimes can\u2019t see each other. \u2018We think that possibly these signals could signal to females and males who are out of sight behind a bush or over the hill,\u2019 she added. The two raptors were discovered in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Both died and were buried next to each other when a large sand dune collapsed on top of them, creating the interesting fossil. When they were first unearthed, the two oviraptors were given the nicknames Romeo and Juliet because they seemed reminiscent of Shakespeare's famously doomed lovers. \u2018We discovered that, although both oviraptors were roughly the same size, the same age and otherwise identical in all anatomical regards, \u201cRomeo\u201d had larger and specially shaped tail bones,\u2019 Mr Persons said. \u2018This indicates that it had a greater capacity for courtship displays and was likely a male.\u2019 By comparison, the second specimen, Juliet, had shorter and simpler tail bones, suggesting a lesser capacity for peacocking, and has been interpreted as a female. According to Persons, the two may very well have been a mated pair, making for a romantic story, as the dinosaur couple was preserved side by side for more than 75 million years. While the theory is compelling, Thomas Holtz, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland in College Park told Nature that it\u2019s not yet completely convincing, because only one pair of oviraptor specimens have been studied. Therefore, there is a possibility that the difference in Chevron shape was a variation, rather than a sign of sexual dismorphism.\n","right_summary":"'Egg thief lizards' preserved in rock for 75 million years were studied.

{"document":"Former Cuban president Fidel Castro has appeared in public for the first time in more than a year, his first since his country reached a landmark agreement with the US to reestablish ties. The state-run Cubadebate website says Castro greeted a group of Venezuelans visiting the capital of Havana. Cubadebate on Friday published four images that show Castro sitting inside a bus, each with a different person stretching an arm through the window to shake his hand. Images of Fidel Castro meeting with Venezuelan visitors to Havana were reported in Cuban media on Friday, though the encounters were said to take place on Monday. The meetings, with photos taken inside Castro's bus, are the former president's first public appearance since January 2014. Castro's face is largely obscured by a dark-colored baseball cap. He sports longish gray hair and a beard. The website said the encounter occurred Monday, but did not explain the delay in publishing the photos. He is shown shaking hands, which Cubandebate said occurred 'for hours,' with Venezuelans in Havana who had come for solidarity events. Castro will turn 89 on Aug. 13. He was last seen in public at the inauguration of an artist's studio in January 2014. In February and March of this year, official Cuban media published photographs of Castro taken during private meetings with a Cuban student leader and with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. State media reports about the event said that Castro was 'full of vitality' and shook hands 'for hours' before going to a school. Castro, whose country has close ties with the leftist Venezuelan government, said that the South American country had become the target of 'imperial greed' Though Monday's reported appearance is his first in public since a landmark deal to reestablish ties between the US and Cuba, Castro met with spies released by the US in the agreement earlier this year. He also appeared with the Cuban agents who were freed from prison in December after a landmark agreement between the Obama administration and his brother Raul to reestablish ties between the island and the US. Fidel, older than his brother by five years, expressed skepticism about the deal, which includes plans for a US Embassy in Havana and has lessened travel restrictions. Cuban media said that Castro's meeting went off 'without the slightest of problems' and he urged his residents to write to Obama and urge him to stop saying that Venezuela y was a threat. It said that the former leader talked about how the South American country had become a target for 'imperial greed'. The American president signed sanctions against several Venezuelan officials earlier this year. Castro, whose recent public appearances often largely serve the function of proving that he is alive, was said to be 'full of vitality'. He also reportedly stopped and spoke at a school. The former revolutionary stepped aside temporarily as president due to serious illness in July 2006, and Raul took over permanently in February 2008 after he was elected the country's new leader. Fidel Castro took over Cuba after the fall of the Batista military dictatorship. Raul Castro (left) is five years younger than his brother and has taken over as president of Cuba.

{"document":"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)It is a strangely detached scene for the close of America's longest war: military trainers bouncing between multi-million dollar, high security bases, on Black Hawks, miles from the front line. But it is how Washington wants this to be. And even though the departure of American troops will be fractionally slower, they will all be inside the U.S. Embassy by the end of next year, making these some of their last weeks outside of the wire. We are near Jalalabad, at a regional logistics hub for the Afghan police force -- a generous facility that was originally intended to resupply the entire east of the country with uniforms, ammunition, even fuel for vehicles. The intentions, first hatched in 2011 when the U.S. had tens of thousands of troops and still large ambitions for their war here, were large in scale. But the project has been handed between rotations of U.S. officers and is perhaps a little distant from its first conception. We are taken on a proud tour of a series of clean and newly painted blocks. Dozens of Afghan police gather there, and mill around, waiting for their commanders to arrive. Nick Paton Walsh's Afghanistan series: Afghan forced to marry her rapist. Yet a few problems are immediately visible. There are no doorhandles on the outer doors -- we're told they've been removed while a new master key is being sought. There seem to be few supplies in the actual hub. We ask the Afghan policemen how many of them get resupplied there, at this stage, four months since it opened, and they say: none. About 20 units a month file paperwork for resupply in the base, but supplies often still come from where they did before -- Kabul. U.S. officials told us they are optimistic the logistical road ahead can be smoothed -- that in the 18 plus months they have left they can get the Afghan army and police up to furnishing themselves with the supply lines they need. But here, now, that seems far away. As does the base, incidentally. It's quite a rough drive from the main road, surrounded by hills, and with at best patchy cellphone coverage -- far from ideal for a transit hub. Nick Paton Walsh's Afghanistan series: ISIS recruits in Taliban territory. And it is far away in terms of its cost. Like so much in the most costly of wars, its price tag may have made sense in briefings on Capitol Hill, where effectiveness is gauged in millions, but here in dusty eastern Afghanistan, it seems exorbitant. This as-yet, partially functional resupply hub cost $21 million, a price that presumably includes new doorhandles. There are about fifty Afghan police currently on the base -- meaning each one has so far cost $400,000 to the US taxpayer. But this is an unfair way of representing the challenge the U.S. trainers here face: working, as they are, against a clock, with diminishing resources and public interest, in an endlessly complex and often corrupt land where, when the Taliban aren't thriving, ISIS are waiting in the wings to fill the gap. With the clock ticking in the background, U.S. officer Colonel JB Vowell remains upbeat: \"It's going to be a challenge, to get all those little hubs and spokes -- logistics to maintenance, supplies, resupply. I'm optimistic though; much of this didn't exist in November.\" On the outskirts of the base are the relics of the U.S.'s military involvement in a conflict that still continues to kill Afghan security forces at an accelerated  rate. SUVs, even old American Humvees -- now gifted to Afghan police to drive around -- lie disabled by mine strikes. The Americans were hoping the police could stack the vehicles here, assess their resupply needs, or cannibalize the damaged vehicles for spare parts. Throughout, the surreal changes in how this war was, and continues to be, fought are omnipresent. Years ago, the threat would have mostly been from insurgents taking potshots at an American base. Now we are far from the threat, but another has taken its place. Surrounding our crew at all times are \"Guardian Angels\" -- U.S. soldiers on guard duty, protecting their own from rogue Afghan police or soldiers, trying to prevent the newest and most serious scourge -- \"green on blue\" attacks, in which Afghan security forces turn their guns on Americans. It is a strange experience to be protected from those who America seeks to hand the country over to. But this is how the war ended. Not with ideological victories, or dramatic withdrawals, just the slow and deliberate stepping to one side.\n","right_summary":"Final troop pullout oddly detached as U.S. military operations die down in Afghanistan. Ambitious projects, like a police logistics center in Jalalabad, may not live up to their potential.\n","hallucinated_summary":"U.S. military presence in Afghanistan remains strong despite the end of the longest war in American history. The U.S. Embassy will serve as the base for all American troops by the end of next year, and they continue to fly Black Hawks to high-security bases far from the front lines. The U.S. officers are optimistic that they can train Afghan security forces to furnish themselves in the 18 plus months they have left. The cost of the partially functional resupply hub was $21 million, which includes the cost of new doorhandles. Despite the challenges, Colonel JB Vowell remains upbeat and confident in the logistical road ahead."}

{"document":"Hitting out: Justin Welby said the students killed in Kenya by Islamic militants were 'martyrs' THE Archbishop of Canterbury will today hail the students killed by Islamist militants in Kenya last week as \u2018martyrs\u2019, as Church leaders and politicians use Easter to condemn persecution of Christians. Justin Welby will say in his Easter sermon that 148 Christian students slaughtered by Somali gunmen on Thursday were \u2018witnesses\u2019 to their faith and suffered \u2018cruel deaths\u2019. His comments follow Pope Francis\u2019s denunciation of the \u2018senseless\u2019 killings at Garissa University College, in which Christians were singled out and shot. The Pope said in a Good Friday service in Rome that too many were guilty of a \u2018complicit silence\u2019 in the face of such attacks. In an overtly religious Easter message, David Cameron says it was \u2018truly shocking\u2019 that Christians were still tortured or killed because of their faith in much of the world. Their outspoken comments came as three people were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the attack in the north-east of Kenya, bringing the total number of suspects being held to five. The Kenyan Government said the three, who were trying to cross into Somalia, are associates of Mohamed Mohamud, a former teacher at a Kenyan Madrassa Islamic school, who is believed to have co-ordinated the attack. Meanwhile, a survivor of the killings was found yesterday two days after the massacre. Cynthia Charotich, 19, hid in cupboard and covered herself with clothes, refusing to emerge when classmates came out of hiding at the demand of the Al-Shabaab gunmen. Archbishop Welby will also refer in his sermon in Canterbury Cathedral to other Christians killed in massacres, including in Libya, saying: \u2018There have been so many martyrs in the last year.\u2019 148 Christian studentsat Garissa University College, Kenya, were slaughtered by Somali gunmen on Thursday.

{"document":"Thierry Henry has criticised Arsenal's recent dealings in the transfer window and has urged his former side to purchase four top players in the summer. The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack. Henry (centre) said after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud (right) may need replacing. Hull (away) - May 4. Swansea (home) - May 11. Man United (away) - May 17. Sunderland (home) May 20. West Brom (home) - May 24. Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Henry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine. They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand. 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, according to Henry. Giroud, pictured during Arsenal's match against Chelsea, has scored 14 Premier League goals this season.\n","right_summary":"Thierry Henry hit out at Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud after Chelsea draw.

{"document":"A surrender order issued by Hitler's successor in the final days of the Second World War that was found on the chief of the Luftwaffe when he was arrested is being auctioned 70 years later for \u00a321,000. The typed dispatch \u2013 owned by a US collector \u2013 was sent by German president Karl Doenitz on May 8, 1945, telling officers to abandon fighting or face the Allies' wrath. It was seized from Luftwaffe chief Robert von Greim when he was arrested that day. The WWI fighter ace then killed himself rather than be tortured by the Russians. The surrender order that is being auctioned is being auctioned by Bonhams, New York. The typed order\u00a0sent by German president Karl Doenitz is expected to fetch \u00a321,000 when it goes under the hammer. Grand Admiral Doenitz had been Hitler's choice to replace him as leader of the Nazis, a role he assumed following the dictator's suicide on April 30. But a week later, amid a crumbling and defeated Reich, Doenitz met with Allied commanders to sign the instrument of surrender, bringing an end to war in Europe. The following day Doenitz, who had been commander of the German navy up until Hitler's death, sent a telex message to his commanders in the field informing them of the immediate surrender 'to save as many people as possible for Germany'. Describing the action as 'unavoidable', Doenitz instructed officers to abandon all fighting or face the wrath of the Allies. The note read: 'On 7 May 1945 0241, the Supreme Command of the Wehrmacht signed the unconditional surrender of all armed forces on land, on water, and in the air to the Supreme Command of the Allied Expeditionary Forces as well as the Soviet Supreme Command. 'This was unavoidable in order to prevent the complete destruction of certain parts of the front, which was expected to occur in a short time, and, in doing so, to save as many people as possible for Germany. 'Accordingly, on 9 May 1945 0100 GST every ongoing combat activity must be abandoned. 'All officers of the army, navy and the Luftwaffe, as well as troops of the Wehrmacht divisions and the Waffen SS shall remain in their current positions. 'Effective immediately, no maritime vehicle or aeroplane shall be sunk or destroyed, no military equipment may be damaged in any way.' He finished the message with a stark warning that if his officers 'do not act according to the conditions of surrender, the Command of the Allied Expeditionary Forces and Soviet Command will undertake punitive measures or other steps beyond the conditions of surrender.' Von Greim, 52, a WWI fighter ace, had been put in charge of the Luftwaffe after Hitler turned on Herman Goering accusing him of treason. Railing against his former comrades, Hitler summoned von Greim to Berlin and ordered him to hunt down and kill Gestapo chief Heinrich Himmler who he believed had tried to harbour a peace deal with the Allies. The order was seized from Luftwaffe chief Robert von Greim when he was arrested that day. Von Greim escaped Berlin in a camouflaged plane and his actions thereafter are unknown until he was arrested in Austria by US troops on May 8. On his arrest, Von Greim admitted to his captors: 'I am the head of the Luftwaffe, but I have no Luftwaffe'. He was taken to Salzburg and was due to be handed over to the Soviets but committed suicide by taking a cyanide pill on May 24. The note is one of the only copies of Doenitz's dispatch known to exist today. It is tipped to fetch \u00a321,000 when it goes under the hammer at Bonhams auction house on behalf of a private collector from the US. Tom Lamb, an expert in military history at Bonhams, said: 'The story behind this document is an incredible one. 'Hitler was in his bunker in Berlin a few days prior to his death and he called von Greim, one of his closest and most trusted allies. 'Von Greim was flown in to Berlin amid all the fighting. That evening Hitler launched a rant about how his right hand man Heinrich Himmler had betrayed him. 'Hitler ordered von Greim to go and kill Himmler for treason then take control of the Luftwaffe following the treason of Goering. 'Von Greim left immediately in his camouflaged plane and amazingly managed to escape out of Berlin without being caught. 'He was supposed to go to Plon in northern Germany to track down Himmler but he was arrested on May 8, the same day as the German surrender, by US troops in Austria. 'Hitler had committed suicide a week earlier and Admiral Doenitz had taken charge. On May 7 1945 Doenitz had signed the instrument of surrender and the following day he sent his high command a dispatch informing them. 'Doenitz warned that if the Germans didn't stop fighting they would be killed by the Americans or the Russians. 'He understood the end had come and he was telling his high command to make sure everyone knew that. 'The telegram from Doenitz was found on Von Griem when he was arrested. 'Von Greim was then taken to Salzburg where he was due to be part of a Soviet-US prisoner exchange but fearing torture at the hands of Stalin he took his own life with a cyanide pill. 'Copies of the surrender note from Doenitz are exceptionally rare - many were lost or destroyed but somehow this one survived. 'This document is incredibly important in the history of the 20th century.' The auction will take place in New York on April 29.\n","right_summary":"Typed dispatch sent by German president Karl Doenitz on May 8, 1945.

{"document":"Arnold Schwarzenegger has unleashed a tirade against Indiana's polarizing Religious Freedom Restoration Act, saying the new laws are 'distracting and divisive' for the Republican Party. While the legislation has sparked a nationwide outcry, with many claiming it legalizes discrimination against lesbians and gays and causing boycotts of the state, the actor and former California governor has a different take on the controversy. Writing an op-ed for The Washington Post, Schwarzenegger says he believes the defining problem is that Republicans are focusing on the wrong issues, in a move that will only hurt the GOP and further alienate voters. He wrote in the piece Friday:\u00a0'As an American, I\u2019m incredibly concerned about what happened in Indiana this week and the threat of similar laws being passed in other states. '(But) as a Republican, I\u2019m furious.' Blast: Former California governor\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger became the latest celebrity to speak out against Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, calling it a 'distracting' law that only hurts the Republican Party. Schwarzenegger continued: 'I know plenty of Republicans who are sensible and driven to solve problems for America \u2026 This message isn\u2019t for them \u2026 It is for Republicans who choose the politics of division over policies that improve the lives of all of us. 'It is for Republicans who have decided to neglect the next generation of voters. It is for Republicans who are fighting for laws that fly in the face of equality and freedom. 'If we want our party to grow and last, we must be focused on real solutions to problems Americans are facing. 'But distracting, divisive laws like the one Indiana passed aren't just bad for the country, they\u2019re also bad for our party. 'Polls show that laws like this are not supported by independents, women, minorities or Americans between 18 and 29. Outcry:\u00a0Protesters hold signs protesting Indiana's controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has made the state the target of a boycott by businesses, local governments and individuals across the US. Angered: Demonstrators gather in Indianapolis to protest a controversial religious freedom bill recently signed by Indiana Governor Mike Pence during a rally last weekend. March: Thousands of opponents of Indiana Senate Bill 101, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, gather for a protest on the lawn of the Indiana State House on March 28. 'If the Republican Party wants the next generation of voters to listen to our ideas and solutions to real problems, we must be an inclusive and open party, not a party of divisions. 'We must be the party of limited government, not the party that legislates love. 'We must be the party that stands for equality and against discrimination in any form.' Schwarzenegger was the Governor of California between 2003 and 2011. In 2008 he opposed California\u2019s controversial Prop 8 in favor of LGBT rights. However the bill, which made gay marriage illegal in California, was still passed while he was governor. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, brought in by Indiana Governor Mike Pence, with a near-identical bill brought in in Arkansas, were supposed to satisfy evangelicals by 'upholding religious freedom', but subsequently sparked boycotts of both states. The Republican governors of both states signed off Thursday on changes approved by the legislatures aimed at clarifying the intent behind the legislation. To a large extent, the measures were modeled after a federal law enacted in 1993 with broad bipartisan support. But critics of the new measures said they were designed with a different motive \u2014 to shield businesses and individuals who do not want to serve gays and lesbians, such as florists or caterers who might be hired for a same-sex wedding.\n","right_summary":"Former California governor criticises the GOP for not focusing on issues that matter, such as airport delays, graduation rates and air pollution.

{"document":"Keith Cameron, pictured, \u00a0was jailed for five years for scamming his dying friend and neighbour out of his life savings. A conman has been jailed for fleecing a dying architect out of his life savings and using the money to fund his lavish lifestyle. Keith Cameron splashed out on a New York flat for his daughter and enjoyed a string of extravagant holidays while his victim's family have been left facing the prospect of selling their home. The 54-year-old scammed his trusting friend and terminally ill neighbour, Jonathan Speirs, out of \u00a3476,864 in a complicated ruse. He promised the world-famous lighting architect a \u00a32million return on his investment in just two years, but it was all an elaborate lie. Cameron was today jailed for five years at Edinburgh Sheriff Court. But Jonathan's wife, Elizabeth, 58, said: 'My daughters and I will be dealing with the consequences of his crime both emotionally and financially for the rest of our lives.' Cameron stole the family's money and spent it on his extravagant lifestyle and a New York flat for his own daughter, who attended the American Academy of Drama and the Arts. Meanwhile, Jonathan's youngest daughter faces missing out on a place at her dream university in New York. Cameron persuaded terminally ill Jonathan - his close friend and neighbour for 13 years - to part with thousands of pounds by claiming his telecoms start-up required money to win a valuable contract. He repeatedly claimed the company was trading well and that Jonathan could expect a return on his investment of around \u00a32 million within two years. Cameron, from Edinburgh, instead used his friend's cash to maintain a excessive lifestyle of posh restaurants and fancy holidays. Jonathan died of stomach cancer in 2012. His widow, Elizabeth, from Edinburgh, said Cameron's heartless scheme had stopped her daughter, Erin, 17, from following her dreams. She said: 'Keith Cameron deserved a lengthy prison sentence. I am glad the Sheriff chose to impose the maximum sentence on the fraud charge. 'However, no length of prison term will ever compensate for the dreadful crime he committed. 'My daughters and I will be dealing with the consequences of his crime both emotionally and financially for the rest of our lives. 'If Keith Cameron hadn't defrauded us, Erin could have followed her dreams. But we have to live with knowing that our money was spent on allowing Cameron's daughter to study in New York while my daughter can't. 'Despite having the academic qualifications and the ability to gain a place on this course, we'll probably have to turn it down because we can't afford the fees. Victims:\u00a0Jonathan Speirs, a world-famous lighting architect, pictured with his wife Elizabeth, was persuaded to part with a total of \u00a3476,864. 'This is so unfair and it's breaking my heart that I can't give her the education she has worked so hard for. 'I am struggling to come to terms with the depths of Keith Cameron's depravity now that I know the full details of how he deceived a dying man.' Elizabeth, a supply teacher, also revealed that Cameron had texted her asking to see her husband just days before he passed away in June 2012. Mr Speirs died of stomach cancer in 2012 after investing in his friends scam. The text read: 'Tell him I don't care what he looks like, he's a dear friend and that's all that matters.' Elizabeth said the family now faced being forced to sell off her home in Edinburgh where she had lived with her husband for 24 years. She said: 'It's still hard to believe that someone who, supposedly, was our friend could behave in such a cold-hearted fashion pretending to care about my husband and pretending to show grief at his funeral, whilst all the time he was knowingly spending our money on luxuries for his family - money we'd worked hard for. 'It fills me with horror to think that anyone could be so cruel and heartless towards a good, kind man but especially towards a man who was facing death. 'A lengthy prison sentence is totally justified.' Police Scotland Detective Inspector Arron Clinkscales added: 'Keith Cameron used his expertise and relationship to make his victim believe that this was a legitimate investment. 'To ensure that others do not fall foul of similar fraudulent activities I would urge the public to fully research any investment they are seeking to make. 'When considering making an investment, consider seeking financial and legal advice to ensure protection against fraudulent investments. 'If in any doubt, do not go ahead, and remember if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.' Mrs Speirs said she now faces selling off the home in Edinburgh she shared with her husband for 24 years.

{"document":"Murder: Pennie Davis, left, was killed by a homeless petty crook who was hired by her ex-lover's son. A career criminal hired a hitman to murder his stepmother for just \u00a31,500 after she threatened to accuse him of being a paedophile. Benjamin Carr, 22, harboured a burning hatred of mother-of-five Pennie Davis, 47, during her six-year relationship with his father. He ordered fellow drug dealer Justin Robertson, 36, to kill her after she threatened to tell police he sexually assaulted young girls eight years earlier. Mrs Davis was discovered in a pool of blood by her new husband after she was stabbed while tending her horses in the New Forest. But Carr was caught after the killer accidentally left his car keys beside her body and was forced to call a friend to pick him up from the isolated spot. Detectives discovered cocaine addict Robertson accepted just \u00a31,500 to commit the murder and was paid in counterfeit notes. Yesterday, the two men were jailed for life after a jury convicted them of murder and conspiracy to murder. Robertson will serve a minimum of 32 years and Carr a minimum of 30 years. They were branded \u2018evil\u2019 by a senior police officer as the victim\u2019s family said justice has not been achieved because they will one day walk free. Mrs Davis\u2019 grieving husband Pete, 50, described the former show jumper as an \u2018angel\u2019 who loved nothing more than to ride her horses. \u2018We had our lives just waiting to be taken with both hands together as a married couple and that was taken away from me. It\u2019s been a nightmare ever since,\u2019 he said. Mrs Davis was stabbed 13 times as she tended her four horses in a farm paddock near Beaulieu, Hampshire, last September. The supermarket worker suffered horrific injuries and was discovered by her husband who thought she was sunbathing. Police were quickly on the trail of those responsible and discovered Robertson, of no fixed abode, agreed to murder the victim at the request of Carr. Winchester Crown Court heard he harboured a \u2018lasting hate\u2019 towards Mrs Davis which left Carr estranged from his father after their relationship ended. She had told police Carr sexually assaulted two young girls in 2006, when he was aged just 14, but no further action was taken. Hitman: Justin Robertson, left, was paid \u00a31,500 in counterfeit banknotes by Benjamin Carr, right. A fortnight before the murder Carr discovered she had repeated the allegations in Facebook messages to his father\u2019s new fianc\u00e9e and claimed she had \u2018new evidence\u2019 and would go to police again. Prosecutor Richard Smith QC said: \u2018Ben Carr was worried Pennie Davis was going to go to the police and allege that he had previously indecently assaulted girls. \u2018It was for that reason it seems that Ben Carr wanted Pennie Davis silenced and so he recruited others to help him do that.\u2019 Carr, of Southampton, contacted Robertson, a fellow drug dealer and petty crook, who agreed to carry out the killing and even showed off a knife similar to the murder weapon to a friend. He handed himself in to police but said he had nothing to do with the killing and his keys had been at the scene because he\u2019d dropped them while looking for wealthy homes to burgle in the area. During the trial Robertson, who has been jailed for more than 70 thefts, told the jury he \u2018didn\u2019t care\u2019 if they convicted him and threatened to track down and kill Carr. Standing in the witness box, he said: \u2018Ben, I\u2019m going to chase you down in every prison \u2013 I\u2019m going to find you.\u2019 He even spoke towards Mrs Davis\u2019 relatives in the public gallery and invited them to visit him in prison and look him in the eye. Sentencing Robertson, Mr Justice Popplewell said he was responsible for a carefully planned, brutal and ferocious murder against a \u2018helpless woman\u2019. He said he showed \u2018no remorse\u2019 and branded his behaviour in the witness box as \u2018deplorable\u2019 as well as \u2018arrogant and offensive\u2019. Speaking outside court, one of Mrs Davis\u2019 daughters, Georga Pead, 19, said the jail sentences have not given them justice. Family: Mrs Davis with her five children Daniel, Sophie, Georga, Alex and Joe, pictured left to right. Victim: Pennie Davis was found dead by her husband in a New Forest field in September last year. She said: \u2018Carr has still got his mum and they will both still have people waiting for them outside. We have got to live here without her every single day. I don\u2019t think that is justice at all.\u2019 Mr Davis, 50, added: \u2018Even if they get 30 years in prison they will still get the chance to come out and have families. \u2018Now I just hate everything. Going down to the horses, seeing people holding hands, enjoying the sun, it hurts because that\u2019s what me and Pennie used to do.\u2019 Det Supt Paul Barton, who led the inquiry, said: \u2018Robertson is an evil and cold killer who was motivated by a relatively small amount of money,\u2019 he said. \u2018Carr had a long-term hatred for Pennie. He tried to silence her once and for all and knew Robertson would do anything for money.\u2019 Evidence: Robertson was convicted after police discovered that he had dropped a car key in the field. Mrs Davis's family said in a statement this afternoon: 'The people responsible for our mum's brutal murder have been convicted but we cannot celebrate. 'It is not them, but us, Pennie's family, who have been given the real life sentence. The life of someone precious to us as a mother, daughter, wife and sister has gone and can't be replaced. 'We have attended court every day and have had to listen to many lies about Pennie, who has been robbed of her voice to defend herself. 'The Pennie presented in court by those who were desperate to try to justify their actions is not the Pennie we remember. For us she will always be our warm, loving, protective, determined, funny mum who loved her children more than anything. Wedding: Mrs Davis on the day she married her husband Peter in May last year, with her daughter Georga and Sophie. Couple: Peter Davis today spoke of his grief at the murder of his wife just four months after they married. Heart-broken: Mrs Davis's family (pictured) said in a statement outside Winchester Crown Court today: 'The people responsible for our mum's brutal murder have been convicted but we cannot celebrate. Grief:\u00a0Pennie Davis' daughters Sophie (left) and Georgia (right) read a statement outside Winchester Crown Court. Deceased: Detective Superintendent Paul Barton (pictured) said outside court: 'Pennie was a loving mother who doted on all her children and was just starting a new chapter in her life with husband Pete' 'We appreciate the thorough police investigation, the dedication of the jury and all those involved in this lengthy court case and especially the people who bravely came to court to give evidence. 'We also want to thank the many people who have sent us love and good wishes throughout this ordeal. The outpouring of grief at her death is the best and most faithful tribute to her memory and will not be erased.' Giving evidence, Carr said he only wanted to 'scare' Mrs Davis and did not intend for any physical violence to be used against her. He told jurors: 'Physical words, no actual physical violence, to warn her to back away from me and my family and the wedding.' Bereaved: Mr Davis called his wife an 'angel', adding: 'She was so caring and would do anything for anybody' Grief: Mr Davis with his wife's older children Sophie, Alex and Georga on the lawn in the New Forest where she used to play with them. Describing the payment to Robertson, Carr said: 'We talked about \u00a31,500 of false money and that was how it was going to be at first because they have some value on the street. 'That changed later on through the week because he didn't want the fake currency - he wanted real money and \u00a3400 cash and a quarter of cocaine.' Robertson said he agreed to help because he had been told by Carr that he was sexually abused by Mrs Davis as a child. Carr denied this, claiming that he had only told Robertson: 'She's ruined my life, she brought up these allegations, made them up, yeah, ruined my life.' Mrs Davis was followed from her work at a Sainsbury's supermarket in her home town of Blackfield to the field near Beaulieu where she kept her horses. Robertson later confessed to a friend and 'justified' his actions by saying that he believed his victim was a 'nonce' - triggering a deep-seated hatred of paedophiles which dated back to when he was abused as a child. Detective Superintendent Paul Barton, of Hampshire Police, said outside court: 'Pennie was a loving mother who doted on all her children and was just starting a new chapter in her life with husband Pete. Pete, added that she loved showjumping when she was younger, adding: 'To me she was an angel, she was just so caring and she would do anything for anybody. 'When we met we just seemed to click and we saved each other and I knew everything was going to be fine. 'We had our lives just waiting to be taken with both hands together as a married couple and that was taken away from me. It's been a nightmare ever since. 'Well they say it gets easier as time goes on but at the moment I can't see that.' Search: Forensic police at the site in the New Forest where Mrs Davis was killed in September last year.

{"document":"Psychologists and wellness experts have long-known that we're at our happiest when we're doing the things we love. But, according to one new study, a third of Australian women are not finding time for their hobbies and passions. The survey of 1,025 Australian parents, conducted by Officeworks, found that more women had foregone personal interests for work commitments or to finance 'more important' things in the last week, than had men. The cost, says clinical psychologist and Happiness Institute wellness expert Dr Paula Watkins, will be our happiness - and potentially that of our children. According to a recent study of more than 1,000 Australian parents, a third of Australian women are not finding time for their hobbies, choosing work and 'more important things' over their passions. 'We know that we tend to gravitate towards hobbies and interests that use our best strengths but a lot of the other things we do in our lives, including work, do not,' Dr Watkins told Daily Mail Australia. 'This is why it's so important for us to consciously do more of the things that bring us joy.' Dr Watkins says changing work spaces and technology do contribute to stress and brain overload. 'We know that we\u2019re filling life with more info, we know that technology has so many pros - but the information we\u2019re exposed to grows exponentially,' she says. 'We have to look at how we can break up a day at work \u00a0because its abnormal for a brain to focus on a screen for 8 plus hours a day.' 'Remember the brain is wired to pay attention, the brains will just keep processing information to the point of exhaustion, so we actually have to take more care of ourselves. Otherwise, we run the risk of over-stressing our brains, by actually not doing very much.' Clinical psychologist and Happiness Institute Wellness Expert Dr Paula Watkins says its important to create space for the things we love to be happy. One interesting finding to come out of the recent survey, Dr Watkins says, is that twenty per cent of women are inspired to start new hobbies through social media. 'Being inspired is a great thing, so long as that translates into our real lives,' she says. 'If it doesn't, it can actually add another layer of stress.' 'What we're seeing is that women could actually be more inspired than ever before, right at the time that we're also more time poor.' So how can we create more space in our lives for the things we love? Dr Watkins says its important to be pragmatic. 'We have to look at our lives and ask: \"what can go?\"' she says. 'It's not about loading more onto our lives, we've all done that, if we're going to add something in, something else has to go, or we're just going to feel overloaded.' Spending time doing things you love with friends has the advantage of the 'accountability' factor, Dr Watkins says. Dr Watkins also emphasises the importance of being organised. 'Get prepared,' she says. 'Whatever your hobby or interest is, recognise that you're actually going to need the gear to do it. 'Next time an unexpected pocket of free time opens up, you can take advantage of it if you've got the craft stuff you need at hand, for example, or your runners under your desk at work.' Other tips include spending more time sharing your passions with friends - this has the added 'accountability factor' - \u00a0and giving to others, perhaps by volunteering your time to others. 'Make a list, then pick one or pick two things you love\u2013 you can shelve the other stuff \u00a0for another time - it\u2019s there, the seed has been planted,' Dr Watkins says. Finally, Dr Watkins says women should include their 'little people' in the things they love because hobbies and passions are created in childhood. Another worrying statistic that was revealed in the Officeworks survey is that\u00a085 per cent of younger Australians, specifically GenY respondents, said they have also stopped pursing interests that they are passionate about because they feel they should be spending money on 'more important things' or using their time to complete work or home duties. According to Dr Watkins, the current situation of parents failing to pursue the things they love is concerning for generations to come because it sets a dangerous cultural norm in Australia. Pursuing past-times and creative outlets has a positive impact on children, she says and promotes healthy lifestyle choices for teenagers and young adults. 1. Lighten your load. Prioritising your commitments and saying \u2018no\u2019 occasionally can free up your time. 2. Use your breaks. Lunch breaks, coffee runs or public transport commutes provide you with opportunities to take time out. 3. Be prepared. Being prepared can help you take advantage of opportunities. Carry your camera with you, store a journal in your bag, leave a pair of running shoes at work. 4. Commute creatively. Create a Pinterest board on your tablet (like an iPad), discover new artists on Spotify or read a magazine about your hobby. 5. Include friends. Combining your social commitments with your passion is a great way to go. It help enhance your feeling of connectedness with your peers while providing you a creative or physical outlet. 6. Prioritise passions. Focus your efforts on one or two interests at a time. Remember, you can revisit other projects later when you have more free time. 7. Pledge a commitment. Joining a club or engaging a coach to mentor you will do two things: continually motivate you and challenge you to further develop your skills. 8. Involve your little people. Many of our hobbies begin in childhood, so share yours with the little people in your life. Childhood is all about learning and exposing your children to new activities. It helps their brain strengthen old connections and make new ones. 9. Make it work. With only 9% of Aussies admitting they\u2019re very happy at work, it\u2019s time to get creative and find ways to enhance your workplace. Instead of attending another office meeting, suggest a walking meeting or build staff members\u2019 hobbies into team-building activities. 10. Gifts that give. Try volunteering or coaching to stay connected to your passion. When you commit your time to others, you\u2019re more likely to leave work on time and prioritise your hobbies.\n","right_summary":"A third of Australian women are not making time for hobbies and passions.

{"document":"A family of four was enjoying a day out together in Portland, Maine when a white man yelled a racial slur at them before speeding off. The family consisted of a black mother and a white father who were with their nine-year-old daughter and 23-year-old son. The man was in a car filled with a group of young white men when he screamed 'Hey n*****s!' at them on Friday and drove away. Several bystanders witnessed the incident, including a local news reporter for WCSH 6 and WLBZ 2, Jackie Ward. She shared her account of the story on Facebook, as a 'reminder for us to be kinder to each other.' The story has since caused a stir in Maine - shocking some residents of the state. News anchor Jackie Ward (left) shared the story of Shay Stewart-Bouley (right), a blogger who writes about race, and her family when the racial slur was shouted at them on Friday. She said she shared her account of the story as a reminder to be kinder. The mother, Shay Stewart-Bouley who runs a blog called Black Girl In Maine and writes about race, has told her story of how the incident unfolded that day. She wrote in her blog: 'As a mixed-raced family in a white space, the reality is that anytime we leave our house as a family, we risk incurring the wrath of the ignorant and hateful. 'To partake in the joys of the first treats of spring can turn ugly without notice and, sadly, a visit to Maine\u2019s most populous city yesterday was the day when the ugly became personal and my nine-year-old daughter learned that there are people who will never know her essence but instead will reduce her to nothing more than a n*****.' Ward who was with in the Old Port when she watched the incident, and said in the moment she had become frozen and was unable to comprehend what was happening. She wrote on Facebook: 'Yesterday in the Old Port, an adorable family of four was walking down Fore Street enjoying the day, popping in and out of stores along with everyone else in downtown Portland. 'I was waiting outside of a store with my dog when they were walking on Fore Street. Suddenly, a man driving by screamed the n-word at them as he sped off. As the girl's brother chased after the car, Ward said she saw the child become visibly upset. She wrote: 'What happened next is what made me the most sad. As the dad crossed the street to see if he could see how far his son was running, the little girl started getting visibly upset with what was going on. 'But the mom remained calm and stern. She told the girl her brother is a grown man who can stand up for what he believes in. \"People are going to use that word and you need to know how to stand up for yourself.\" Ward shared the story on Facebook (the post above) which went viral and prompted Stewart-Bouley to write a blog post with her account of the racist incident. After the man shouted the slur, Stewart-Bouley's son (above) ran after the car filled with anger after 'enduring such language with regularity as a grown man' his mother said. 'My heart broke for that little girl as she harshly learned how our society has such a long way to go when it comes to racism.' After sharing her post, several readers asked if anyone traced the car or got the license plate number, while others asked Ward if she took action in the moment. Stewart-Bouley wrote on Ward's post that she was upset following the incident but that was not the time and place to be emotional. 'I have lived in Maine 13 years now, I write about race and I head up an anti racism organization Community Change Inc in Boston. 'In that moment, my only concern was the safety of my children specifically my son who after spending his childhood in Maine and enduring such language with regularity as a grown man is no longer willing to have his humanity denied.' Stewart-Bouley wrote: 'I was upset but that was not the time and place to be emotional' She added in her blog post that while she was grateful for Ward's observations she was saddened that she was not comfortable enough following the exchange to come over to the family and ask if they were okay. 'Racism is a system, and that silence upholds that system even when we don\u2019t believe we are actively creating harm,' wrote\u00a0Stewart-Bouley. In a follow-up post on Sunday, Ward hit back at critics clarifying that her intentions with sharing the story was to remind people to respect one another, while addressing the questions surrounding what she did during the incident. She wrote: 'First, I'm glad so many people are talking about a real issue in Maine, but I also want to clarify a few things. 'For those people questioning my motives, I didn't share the story for personal attention or to try to stir up controversy. Stewart-Bouley wrote in her blog that she was saddened Ward did not feel comfortable enough to ask if the family was okay. Ward wrote a follow-up post on Facebook apologizing for her lack of action during the incident while clarifying her intentions. 'I was trying to make a positive out of a terrible incident by opening people's eyes to the fact that these incidents do still happen and reminding people to respect one another.' She added: 'I understand now that my inaction was hurtful to the family and for that I'm very sorry. It was not due to a lack of outrage or sympathy but simply that I didn't know whether the family would appreciate someone interjecting themselves into the situation. 'I thought that the way I could help would be by bringing awareness to it by writing about it.' As for Stewart-Bouley and her family, she said on Friday during the car ride home the mood of the day had been destroyed. She said her family was reminded that the world can be an utterly ugly place. As her daughter asked if they could move away, she told her 'ugly can live anywhere'. 'If I felt there was a place that was safe and where we could be assured that we would never hear that word again, I would move heaven and earth to get us there,' she wrote.\n","right_summary":"Jackie Ward witnessed the family of four have racial slur shouted at them while they were out for the day on Friday.

{"document":"A father and his two sons who accosted pensioners with dementia in the street asking for payment for roof repairs they hadn't done have been jailed for a total of eight years. Albert Webb, 51, and sons Jimmy Chuter, 26, and Jesse Webb, 19, followed people aged up to 97 home from the Post Office after they had collected their pensions before demanding the cash. If the victim had no money on them, they would be driven to a nearby cash point to withdraw it, or the trio would con their way into their homes before stealing from them. Albert Webb, 51, from Surrey, was jailed for three and a half years and son Jimmy Chuter, 26, was jailed for four years after they harassed pensioners with dementia in the street, demanding money. In total the family gang carried out 35 thefts, starting in February 2012 - when pensioners were still able to withdraw cash from their local Post Office. Most of the victims were women aged in their 70s or 80s, while the eldest was a 97-year-old man. The trio would drive alongside their victims in a\u00a0silver Mercedes C200 until they got close to their house, before jumping out and telling them they had come to collect payment for roofing work. Jesse Webb, 19, was due to be sentenced with his father and brother, but went on the run. He was given a 12 month term this week after being caught. In fact, no work had been carried out, but because many of the elderly victims were suffering from dementia, they simply accepted what they were being told. The offending continued until October 2015 across Hertfordshire, Avon and Somerset, Hampshire, Oxford and Surrey. By the time officers from Hertfordshire Constabulary managed to catch up with the gang, it is believed they had taken around \u00a315,000 from their vulnerable victims. Appearing at St Albans Crown Court in January, Chuter, from  Somerset, was jailed for four years for conspiracy to defraud and Albert Webb, from Surrey, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years for burglary and fraud offences. Jesse Webb was due to be sentenced on the same day, but went on the run. He was tracked down and appeared in the dock on Thursday this week, where he was given 12 months behind bars. Detective constable Kieran Doyle said: 'We were able to arrest his father and brother and bring them before the courts but Jesse evaded police so upon their sentencing, we issued a wanted appeal to trace Jesse. 'We received information which led us to him and I'm pleased that he has had his day in court. 'These really were shameful crimes and it's beyond belief that they could stoop so low to pick out their victims and follow them home, and then make them believe they had carried out repairs to their house and harass them for money.' Officers have started proceedings to confiscate their criminal gains under the Proceeds of Crime Act.The vehicle used during the crimes has already been confiscated by police. St Albans Crown Court heard that the trio would follow their elderly victims, often stalking them home from the Post Office, before jumping out of a car and demanding cash for repairs they hadn't done.\n","right_summary":"Albert Webb, 51, ran con with sons Jimmy Chuter, 26, and Jesse Webb, 19.

{"document":"Matthew Kenney smoked Flakka and then ran naked. A Florida man who was high on a designer drug called Flakka stripped and ran naked through traffic in\u00a0Fort Lauderdale to escape from imaginary killers who he believed stole his clothes and wanted to murder him. Matthew Kenney, 34, told police he smoked Flakka before he streaked though traffic early on Saturday evening while only wearing a pair of sneakers. Flakka, which can be injected, snorted, smoked, swallowed or taken with other substances, has been nicknamed '$5 insanity' for its mind-bending effects and cheap cost. After he was arrested, Kenney told police he would 'rather die than be caught by these unknown people', the Sun Sentinel reported. He added that 'if I got hit by a car they would stop chasing me'\u00a0according to a Fort Lauderdale Police reported. Kenney has previous arrests for disorderly conduct, making a riot and possession of a controlled substance. He was hospitalized for a psychiatric evaluation.

{"document":"Sexting is 'not advised for politicians', says Ed Miliband - and 'risky if you are young, dodgy if you are older' in the words of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Both men were asked their opinion on the practice of sending sexy text messages in a quiz for fashion magazine Cosmopolitan's website. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that it is 'OK for other adults but not for me'. And Education Secretary Nicky Morgan answered: 'A bit too risky, thank you very much!' The verdict: Politicians should not sext, says Ed Miliband (right) and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (left) says it is 'risky' for youngsters and 'dodgy' if you are older. Their responses are hardly surprisingly considering the downfalls of fellow politicians when salacious messages are revealed in the press - including those sent by former MP Brooks Newmark and Tory official Iain Corby. The quiz, which was answered by hand, included a question on the worst thing about politics, which Mr Miliband said was Prime Minister's Questions - 'a bad advert for all of us'. Ms Bennett ticked 'not being able to make the changes you want to', while Ms Morgan opted for people thinking she is boring. Mr Clegg wrote: 'Sitting through 30 minutes of Cameron and Miliband yelling persistently at each other every Wednesday!' The four were also asked about what they would be if not politicians. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that sexting is 'OK for other adults but not for me' Mr Clegg said a wildlife film-maker, while the Labour leader wrote: 'Trying to change the world somehow.' Ms Bennett said she would be an author and Ms Morgan a solicitor. Asked to describe their favourite hangover cure, Mr Miliband said: 'Drinking lots of water but it's been a long time since I had one...' Mr Clegg said: 'Three young boys running around usually does the trick.' Ms Morgan chose a bacon sandwich, while Ms Bennett responded: 'Home-baked gluten-free bread with butter and honey.' In another question, the politicians had to reveal the most hurtful thing they had read about themselves. The Labour leader offered: 'Where do I start?!' and Ms Bennett said a claim that she was trying to be cool, something she says she gave up at the age of 16. The Deputy Prime Minister replied: 'Not hurtful, just absurd - that I have a personal chef! Of course I don't.' Ms Morgan said it was generally people making assumptions about her motives when they have never met her. Another question asked what would be worse than joining the opposition. Mr Clegg said joining Ukip, while Ms Morgan said she would rather join the opposition than do a bungee jump. Ms Bennett and Mr Miliband responded 'none of the above' and 'no way' respectively. It's not difficult to see why the leaders believe politicians should steer clear of sexting as they have plenty of cautionary tales to learn from. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down in May's election after becoming embroiled in a humiliating sexting scandal last year. It was revealed the Conservative member \u00a0bombarded a single mother with up to 40 naked pictures and told her 'I am desperate for sex with you'. The father-of-five was forced to issue a grovelling apology after being caught texting explicit photographs of himself for a second time. He had already left his post as minister for civil society after he was exposed as having exchanged photographs with a male journalist posing as a glamorous young Tory PR woman. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down this year after becoming embroiled in two sexting scandals. In April last year,\u00a0details of salacious messages sent by top Tory official Iain Corby on a gay dating service were revealed. These referred to a sex party\u00a0for Tory researchers at the party\u2019s annual conference in Manchester,\u00a0funded by Conservative MPs\u2019 expenses. The Mail on Sunday revealed that the exchanges involved Mr Corby and were one of the reasons he suddenly quit as head of the Westminster-based Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU), which is paid for by MPs via taxpayer-funded expenses. Disgraced Co-op boss Paul Flowers was suspended from his position after he was filmed buying hard drugs including crystal meth and crack cocaine. The Mail on Sunday revealed exchanges involving Tory official Iain Corby on gay dating service Grindr. The former Labour councillor was further shamed when a teenage rent boy revealed sexually explicit text messages exchanged between them - and revealed he had been asked to accompany Flowers to the summer party of Labour peer Baroness Thornton. And sexting has also caused problems for politicians across the pond. American politician Anthony Weiner, a former representative of the United States House of Representatives, is better known for his two sexting scandals. The first, in 2011, led to his resignation as a Congressman after he sent an intimate picture to a woman over Twitter. And then as he attempted to make a return to politics by running for mayor of New York in 2013, he was forced to admit to sexting three women after pictures were published.\n","right_summary":"Sexting is 'not advised for politicians', says Labour leader Ed Miliband.

{"document":"The cringeworthy, yet\u00a0strangely\u00a0addicting footage of whiteheads being popped,\u00a0cysts\u00a0being ruptured and\u00a0blackheads\u00a0being extracted has turned a dermatologist\u00a0into an internet sensation as thousands of\u00a0people flock to her video channel to catch a glimpse of 'Dr Pimple Popper' in action. Dr Sandra Lee is dermatologist at the\u00a0Skin Physicians & Surgeons practice in Upland, California, and a regular guest on The Doctors talk show, but online she is known simply as Dr Pimple Popper, a moniker she used when she started posting clips of her patients' extractions on her\u00a0YouTube channel. The clips have earned her nearly 60,000 subscribers, as well as loyal fan base of zit squeezing enthusiasts on Reddit. 'I find this little subculture fascinating,' Dr Lee told Racked\u00a0of her followers. 'I pop these things, and yeah they kind of make me feel good, they\u2019re satisfying, but it\u2019s not like I seek them out.' Scroll down for video. All in a day's work: Dermatologist Dr Sandra Lee, who known as Dr Pimple Popper online, shares videos of herself extracting her patients zits on her popular YouTube channel. Day job: Dr Lee, from Upland, California, can be seen using a\u00a0comedone extractor to pop one of her patient's blemishes. Dr Lee explained that when a patient comes in she offers to tackle their blemishes in exchange for them allowing her to post the videos of the process online, while keeping the clips as anonymous as she can. And she noted that, despite the somewhat gruesome nature of her YouTube channel, 'nobody ever says no'. Before she shot to internet fame, Dr Lee's channel, used to only feature a selection of TV segments that she had done, only had a few thousand followers. However, when she joined\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0she started posting short clips of her actually treating patients, a decision which quickly garnered her much more interest, prompting her to start putting full-length clips up on YouTube, starting with a video of her extracting a man's blackheads. 'I didn\u2019t realize how big it would be,' she said of the video, which has received more than 360,000 views since it was posted in December. Dr Lee explained that she was such an 'amateur' at the time; she barely knew anything about Reddit and was 'floored' when she learned that her video was being shared on a popular pimple popping subreddit. The experience opened her eyes to an entire community that she had no idea existed. The doctor, who is now well-known on the subreddit, said the people are 'really wonderful'. Big break: Dr Lee became an internet sensations after she posted this video of herself extracting a man's blackheads on YouTube. The clips was later shared on Reddit and helped her to earn a loyal fan base. But Dr Lee questions whether she is a 'true popper' because she doesn't actually enjoy watching people squeeze and poke their whiteheads and cysts on their own. 'I don\u2019t watch any of the other videos,' she said. 'They all kind of gross me out! When they\u2019re amateur, I don\u2019t want to hear screaming, I don\u2019t like that stuff.' But pimple popping has quickly become a key part of Dr Lee's occupation. In fact, it's basically the family business; both her father and her husband are dermatologists as well. According to Dr Lee the most popular types of popping are the extractions of blackheads and whiteheads, and she has now come to learn that there are two different varieties of video \u2013 \u2018a soft pop and a hard pop'. 'Some people just like blackheads, it\u2019s like soft porn, a soft pop,' she noted. 'And then there\u2019s a hard pop, where people like more of a cyst.' In March, Dr Lee posted a 'best of soft pop' video montage has been viewed more than 500,000 since it was posted last month. 'I've been listening to you guys, and I hear that there are two general groups of you PimplePoppaholics: Some like the SoftPop, some prefer the HardPop!' she wrote in the description. 'Of course, some of you like it all, but I thought I would try to make as many of you happy as I can. Here's a Soft Pop Best Of... I'll have a HardPop Best Of later today for you. Enjoy! [sic]' Free time: The dermatologist, pictured in a selfie posted on her Instagram account, is now well-known among the pimple popping community on Reddit. Basic extraction: Dr Lee said videos of blackheads and whiteheads being removed (pictured) are most popular. And many commenters lauded Dr Lee for her rapport with her patients. Dr Lee, who uses her iPhone and iMovie to shoot and edit the videos, told Racked that she likes to show the 'human side' of her patients by having them share their back story. She said that her favorite clips are of a patient she calls 'Pop', who recently lost his wife to a 'chronic, painful\u00a0sickness'. 'What's amazing is that what started as a video of my squeezing the blackheads on his nose has transformed into the wonderful feel-good human interest story,' she told Daily Mail Online. She continued: 'They were inseparable, and he has had trouble adjusting to his new life in an assisted living facility. He has both financial and emotional stress, and he tells a little of his story in his videos.' After hearing Pop's struggles, Dr Lee's YouTube and Reddit followers asked her to start him a GoFundMe page so they could help him financially. The page, which was started on April 15, has already already exceeded its $5,000 goal - raising $5,665 in just eight days. Family business: Dr Lee can be seen with her husband\u00a0Dr Jeffrey Rebish, who is also a dermatologist. Addicting videos: Dr Lee can be seen extracting a blackhead from one of her patients. 'He knows a little about what is going on, but doesn't know yet how much people have donated to help him out in his current situation,' she explained. 'He would be shocked to hear that well wishes are coming from all over the world.' One commenter who made a donation noted: 'This gentleman reminds me of my grandpa. I wish him all the best, he is such a gentle soul. Lots of love from a French girl in the UK x [sic].' Dr Lee said she plans on visiting him in his new home and present him with all the cards, messages and money that people have given him next week. 'I can't wait to see how surprised and touched he will be,' she said. As for her extraction technique, Dr Lee told Racked that it's 'not completely sterile', but she uses clean gloves and a comedone extractor, which she said costs less than $20. Although she warned that people shouldn't pop their pimples because they can risk scarring, she admitted that she is guilty of squeezing her own zits at home. For people who absolutely have to pick, Dr Lee advised them to use a warm compress and prick the blemish with a sterile needle when it comes to a head. But she he added that she can't ensure anyone that they aren't going to scar when they take matters into their own hands. Dr Lee, who is also a skin cancer surgeon and a cosmetic surgeon, explained that she has posted videos of her doing other procedures, but people aren't as interested in them. 'People might construe that I\u2019m addicted to this stuff, but I\u2019m not,' she said of work as Dr Pimple Popper. 'This isn\u2019t everything that I do.

{"document":"The 'battle of Holland' was nothing short of sensational as Raymond van Barnevald defeated World No 1 Michael van Gerwen - earning the bragging rights and giving himself a fighting chance of qualifying for the showdown at the 02 Arena. Robin van Persie was an interested spectator as he watched the bout on a camel TV and showed his support for his fellow Dutchmen on his Instagram page. The reigning Premier League Darts champion started well and found himself 2-0 up, before Van Gerwen began to score high and leveled the legs up. Raymond van Barneveld was in formidable form as he won 'the battle of Holland' against Michael van Gerwen. But Van Barneveld lived up to his legendary status, with scintillating finishing to ease past his Dutch counterpart, 7-3, and end his previously unbeaten record. Phil Taylor ended his losing run after beating Dave Chisnall and drawing with Stephen Bunting but the 16-time world champion will be disappointed he didn't finish off 'The Bullet' - earning himself maximum points. The 54-year-old rampaged to victory over Chisnall, taking the contest, 7-3, and recovering from back-to-back defeats in his two previous outings. Robin van Persie took to Instagram to show that he was watching his fellow Dutchmen go head-to-head. The Manchester United forward is currently out injured but looks set to leave Louis van Gaal's side. Bunting and Taylor were involved in arguably the match of the night, with both men involved in a quite incredible ending, where they threw a sequence of wayward darts before Bunting hit double one and making sure he took home a point. Adrian Lewis won his third match on the bounce, beating Bunting, 7-2, and condemning his opponent to a heavy defeat. 'Jackpot' boosted his chances of making the knockout stage with a convincing victory as he proved why he's still a player to fear in the Premier League. Phil Taylor will be disappointed he couldn't finsh off Stephen Bunting considering the chances he had. Adrian Lewis showed that he should not yet be written off with an impressive win over Bunting. Gary Anderson produced a sterling fightback to earn himself a draw against James Wade - sending the Scottish crowd wild as he hit double 20 to level it at 6-6. Wade had a number of chances to finish off the tie but was out of sorts in the final four legs, giving the 'Flying Scotsman' a glimmer hope - and he made no mistake. Anderson's point could be crucial - come the end of the competition - when the top four will meet to decide who will the Premier League 2015 champion. Gary Anderson fought back form 6-2 down to earn himself a valuable draw against James Wade in Aberdeen.\n","right_summary":"Raymond van Barneveld beat fellow Dutchman Michael van Gerwen 7-3.

{"document":"Down Augusta way they say the azaleas are in full bloom, which is more than can be said for England\u2019s Justin Rose. A bruising Florida swing last month saw the Englishman fall outside the world\u2019s top 10. For a player who has been virtually a fixture in the top five for the last three years it was certainly a dent to the ego, with the Masters now just around the corner. Rose\u2019s solution to his miserable form \u2014 three missed cuts and a 55th-place finish at the Cadillac Championship in four PGA Tour starts \u2014 was the time-honoured one. For the past two weeks, the 34-year-old has spent long hours on the practice ground. Justin Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69 at the\u00a0Shell Houston Open. In the first round of the Shell Houston Open on Thursday there were encouraging signs his decline will prove temporary. Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69, the same score as his playing partner, the ever- consistent Jordan Spieth. \u2018It\u2019s certainly a welcome return to the sixties, for it had been a while,\u2019 said Rose, smiling. On a day when American Scott Piercy went round in 63 and Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66, it was hardly surprising the only reporter waiting to talk to Rose was this one. But under the radar is never a bad place to be going to the Masters. The boom and bust years that characterised the first half of Rose\u2019s career meant there was never going to be any feelings of panic following his unusually poor run in the Sunshine State. \u2018There\u2019s no doubt I lost my game there but the Florida swing can be unforgiving if you\u2019re slightly off,\u2019 he said. \u2018Over the past two weeks I feel like I\u2019ve done some good work and whether I finish well or not here I feel like I\u2019m going in the right direction again. \u2018Basically I was getting ahead of the ball at impact, and shots were going left or right, the irons were not solid and the new putter was not working. So we\u2019ve corrected the faults and I\u2019ve gone back to the old putter.\u2019 Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66 on Thursday. Does he pay much attention to the world rankings? \u2018You notice, for sure,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019m very proud of the fact I\u2019ve been in the world\u2019s top five for practically the whole of the last three years. It\u2019s a nice ego thing, so by the end of the year I\u2019m hoping there won\u2019t be any slippage. \u2018But right now, I\u2019ve got to focus on my game in the knowledge that the rankings change fast when you\u2019re playing well. I\u2019m in all the tournaments I want to be in, so there\u2019s no need to worry on that score. Typically, your good years are built around four or five really good weeks, so you have to stay patient.\u2019 He\u2019d certainly love for one of those good weeks to be the next one. Rose paid a reconnaissance visit to Augusta last Monday and felt the same old thrill. \u2018It\u2019s such a treat to enjoy it when it is quiet, you still pinch yourself,\u2019 he said. \u2018I think if I\u2019d had a crystal ball when I was 13 or 14 and it had said I\u2019d get to play Augusta every year, I\u2019d have been very happy with that.\u2019 He\u2019s certainly had his share of adventures during his nine appearances to date. Rose might be the only player in Masters history to have led or had a share of the lead after every round bar the last one. His best chance so far of finishing on top after 72 holes came in 2007, when he stood on the 17th hole tied for the lead only to run up a fatal double-bogey six. Paul Casey celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with two eagle threes in a fine round of 68. \u2018The Masters has probably been less on my mind this year because I am trying to find some form,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018But I think the fact I\u2019ve had a number of great rounds there will always stand me in good stead. Regardless of what happens here, I feel comfortable on that course and know I can manage my game even if it\u2019s not 100 per cent. You draw off the energy of the place.\u2019 Mickelson has certainly done that over the years and perhaps the veteran lefty, a three-time Masters champion, is gearing himself up for another run at the green jacket. \u2018It was a good start to the tournament and now I\u2019m looking for three more good rounds,\u2019 he said. 'This is a big week for me. I felt the game was close last week. The only thing missing was chipping and short game.' Paul Casey, like Mickelson another former winner of this event, celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with a fine round of 68 notable for two eagle threes. In the afternoon wave, Padraig Harrington and Lee Westwood both made good starts to play their first six holes in two under.\n","right_summary":"Justin Rose bounced back from Florida misery by carding 69 in Houston.

{"document":"A U.S. citizen with alleged ties to al Qaeda did not enter a plea during his initial court appearance Thursday on charges of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. Muhanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, 29, was deported from Pakistan to the United States. He's accused of plotting to fight against American forces abroad, according to a complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. \"This is news for celebration,\" said CNN counterterrorism analyst Philip Mudd. \"Pretty simple reason why: If you look at a case like this, I think most Americans would say the significance of this case is that this guy, an American, is going to come back home and conduct an attack. Instead, you should look at him as a ... facilitator. \"He's not going to burn himself by coming back. He's going to serve as the conduit or known in Pakistan who understands the West, how you travel, how you stay out of the clutches of law enforcement and he also understands al Qaeda in Pakistan. Those people are really hard to come by. This is a great catch not because he was a potential bomber but because he could have trained tens of bombers.\" Farekh's court appearance comes on the same day that federal prosecutors announced the arrests of two New York women accused of planning to build an explosive device for an attack on U.S. soil. The women, identified as Noelle Velentzas, 28, and Asia Siddiqui, 31, were arrested in a plot inspired by the terrorist group ISIS and others to build a weapon of mass destruction, according to a criminal complaint. They are both U.S. citizens and were roommates in the borough of Queens. Farekh allegedly departed from Canada and headed to Pakistan with two other men in 2007 with the intention of fighting American forces abroad, prosecutors said. In the past 18 months, the Justice Department's National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting more than 30 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups. Of those cases, 18 allegedly involve support to ISIS. \"Given how the terrorist threat to the world is evolving, how the potential terrorist threat to our nation is evolving, homeland security is becoming a matter of 'hometown security,' \" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters Thursday. \"The terrorist threat is more decentralized, more diffuse, more complicated. It involves the potential lone wolf actor, it involves the effective use of social media, the Internet.\" A Texas native, Farekh and his co-conspirators allegedly conspired to provide material support and resources to al Qaeda from 2006 to 2009, according to the complaint. Their intention, according to court documents: To kill and attempt to kill U.S. government employees and military personnel abroad. \"Al Farekh allegedly provided material support to terrorists with every intention of becoming a martyr,\" FBI Assistant Director in Charge Diego Rodriguez said in a statement. \"Today, members of our military are safer.\" When Farekh, another man named Ferid Imam and a third co-conspirator left Canada for Pakistan in 2007, they did not inform their families of their plans, court documents said. The three men were enrolled as students at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. Prosecutors said they called a friend in Canada after arriving in Pakistan to say that they would not be heard from again because they were becoming martyrs. In September 2008, Imam allegedly provided weapons and other military training at an al Qaeda camp in Pakistan to three men -- Najibullah Zazi, Zarein Ahmedzay and Adis Medunjanin. The trio had planned to return to the United States to carry out a suicide attack on the New York subway, according to prosecutors. Zazi and Ahmedzay have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with prosecutors. They have not been sentenced. Medunjanin was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Imam has been indicted for his role in the plot. If convicted, Farekh faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. His next court date is May 2.\n","right_summary":"Muhanad Mahmoud Al Farekh was deported from Pakistan to the United States.

{"document":"Nick Clegg today revealed he struggled with maths at school, as he prepares to launch his election manifesto which will promise to balance the nation's books 'fairly'. The Lib Dem leader told a group of children he was better at languages and art when he was at school. He will use tomorrow's manifesto launch to promise a 'stronger economy and a fairer society', and accuse the Tories of wanting to embark on an unnecessarily deep cuts. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg today revealed he struggled with maths at school, as he prepares to launch his election manifesto which will promise to balance the nation's books 'fairly' Mr Clegg has\u00a0promised to 'spread the burden' of deficit reduction, with cuts to benefits and Whitehall budgets along with tax rises aimed at the very wealthy. He has set out plans for \u00a35billion in new tax rises, \u00a37billion raised from a crackdown on tax avoidance, \u00a312 billion in public spending reductions and a \u00a33 billion cut from welfare. But today he admitted that maths had not been his strong point as a youngster. Answering questions from youngsters at the Cradle Hill community primary school in Seaford, East Sussex, Mr Clegg said: 'My grades were OK. I was better at languages and English and art and history, I was a bit better at that than I was at maths and science.' Despite his professed weakness in science he added:'I liked physics.' Mr Clegg visited the school alongside former minister Norman Baker, who hopes to retain the Lewes seat. Mr Clegg, campaigning with Lib Dem minister Simon Hughes in Southwark, has promised to 'spread the burden' of deficit reduction, with cuts to benefits and Whitehall budgets along with tax rises aimed at the very wealthy. The Lib Dems will launch their manifesto tomorrow, after the Tories unveiled their promise of 'the Good Life' today and Labour's Ed Miliband vowed to cut the deficit every year at his launch yesterday. On the campaign trail in south London earlier, Mr Clegg\u00a0criticised Conservative plans to extend the Margaret Thatcher's flagship Right to Buy scheme. The existing scheme allows tenants living in council-owned properties local authority tenants to buy houses and flats at a discount of as much as 70 per cent up to a maximum of \u00a3102,700 in London and \u00a377,000 across the rest of England. The\u00a0Conservatives plan would extend the scheme to people living in properties owned by housing associations - not-for-profit bodies that receive public money and loans from the private sector to provide low-cost homes. But Mr Clegg said: 'It's a measure of how much the Conservatives have run out of new ideas that the big idea on the day they publish their manifesto is a poor cover version of one of Margaret Thatcher's 1980s hits. It doesn't even add up, it's not even affordable as the housing industry has said.' 'It will not help people who don't presently live in their own home, it does not help the youngsters who are living with mum and dad and want to move out, it does not help the millions of people in private rented accommodation who want to own their own home. 'As the housing industry has said, actually under this plan you will see affordable housing go down rather than go up.' Miriam Clegg at a campaign event in Greater Manchester. Nick Clegg's wife Miriam today revealed how she is juggling the election campaign with making sure their three sons are 'OK during this intensive time'. Mrs Clegg, who uses her maiden name Gonzalez Durantez, hit the campaign trail in Hazel Grove, Greater Manchester. She took part in a series of activities in the guides hut, including making lava lamps and also edible pigs made from cream eggs, chocolate digestives and fondant. Asked if the campaign was a hard time for her and her family, she said: 'It's a busy time. 'I primarily focus on ensuring that our children are OK during this intensive time and then I continue with my normal life and try to help from time to time as I see that I can fit, without changing completely my life, but helping as much as I can.' She said: 'It's an exciting campaign. It's obviously a very close campaign for everybody. Nobody's going to have an outright majority and that makes it quite interesting.' On whether Mr Clegg was holding up, she said: 'Oh yes, you can see him.'

'It was a thing what was always in our minds. It was going through the team. Everyone knew how important this game was, not only because it's a rat race in the last games, but also because of the history of the last four games,' he said.

Both passed away after they were transported to nearby hospitals. William D. Kelley, 50, who was also rescued by the Coast Guard, has improved from critical to serious condition. His pastor, Bill Bowers, said Kelley is 'not able to speak at the moment'. Mandi L. Walkley, 39, (left) and Jacob M. Austin, 52, (right) died after a sudden storm in Washington's Dungeness Bay hit their church kayaking trip. 'He's got a tube down his throat,' Bowers, who is with the Mountain View Church in Tumwater, told the Seattle Times. \u00a0'But I've talked with his wife, and they're hopeful. He's squeezing their hands and blinking at them.' Fellow kayaker William D. Kelley, 50, remains hospitalized. His condition has improved from critical to serious. Walkley, Austin and Kelley were part of a group of seven people who set out on Saturday for an excursion along Washington's Dungeness Spit. According to Sgt. Lyman Moores of Clallam County Sheriff's Office, forecasts had predicted there would be stormy weather the day of the scheduled trip a week ago and that an advisory had been issued a day before. 'No one should've been out there in a kayak,' he said on Sunday. But, according to fellow kayaker Dennis Caines, the terrible weather 'came up all of a sudden' and took the group by surprise. 'We weren't ready for it,' he said. And a video the friends took during the trip shows that the weather was calm as they paddled to the New Dungeness Lighthouse for a lunch break, according to King 5\u00a0News. Caines and the group left the lighthouse around 1.30pm. He told King 5 that within 10 minutes of the wind picking up, he and his wife Linda 'couldn't see anybody or another kayaker anywhere'. The couple, who were riding in a tandem kayak, and two other people with the group paddled safely back to shore. Walkley, Austin and Kelley were stranded in the water for one to two hours before they were rescused by the Coast Guard. They had been part of a group of seven that were kayaking along the Dungeness Spit (pictured) Dennis Caines, who was also on the trip, said the weather was calm as the group stopped at the\u00a0New Dungeness Lighthouse (pictured) for lunch. But minutes after they got back in the water, the wind picked up. At around 2.30pm, Walkley, Austin and Kelley were spotted by a lighthouse attendant, who notified the Coast Guard. The Navy also provided a rescue chopper. Caines said that everyone in the group wore life jackets, and that both he and his wife were also wearing wetsuits. According to Moores, the lifejackets weren't enough to protect the kayakers from the Bay's cold water, which was measured at 49 degrees on the day of the accident. Moores said that kind of temperature could shut down the human body 'in a matter of minutes'. 'These people weren't prepared for the conditions,' he told the Seattle Times. 'They were just wearing cotton clothes.' But, according to Caines, the kayaks the group used were also well-outfitted. At 17-feet long, they had rudders, which help keep the boat straight during waves and winds, as well as rain skirts and pumps designed to keep water out.

{"document":"A New York jury deliberating the fate of the man charged with the 1979 killing of 6-year-old Etan Patz is struggling to reach a verdict. The little boy's disappearance, more than three decades ago, sparked an era of heightened awareness of crimes against children. Deliberations resumed on Thursday, one day after New York Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley ordered the jury to continue efforts to reach a decision on the guilt or innocence of a bodega worker named Pedro Hernandez. On the 10th day of deliberations, the jurors on Wednesday said in a note that they were unable to reach a unanimous decision. Hernandez confessed to police three years ago, but his lawyers said he made up his account of the crime. Etan Patz's parents have waited more than 35 years for justice, but some have questioned whether that is even possible in Hernandez's case. His lawyer has said that he is mentally challenged, severely mentally ill and unable to tell whether he committed the crime or not. Hernandez told police in a taped statement that he lured Patz into a basement as the boy was on his way to a bus stop in Lower Manhattan. He said he killed the boy and threw his body away in a plastic bag. Neither the child nor his remains have ever been recovered. But Hernandez has been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and has an \"IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range,\" his attorney Harvey Fishbein has said. Police interrogated Hernandez for 7\u00bd hours before he confessed. \"I think anyone who sees these confessions will understand that when the police were finished, Mr. Hernandez believed he had killed Etan Patz. But that doesn't mean he actually did, and that's the whole point of this case,\" Fishbein has said. But in November, a New York judge ruled that Hernandez's confession and his waiving of his Miranda rights were legal, making the confession admissible in court. Hernandez is charged with two counts of second-degree murder for allegedly intending to cause the boy's death and for a killing that occurred during a kidnapping. Another man's name has also hung over the Patz case for years -- Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter. Etan's parents, Stan and Julia Patz, sued Ramos in 2001. The boy was officially declared dead as part of that lawsuit. A judge found Ramos responsible for the boy's death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million -- money the Patz family has never received. Though Ramos was at the center of investigations for years, he has never been charged. He served a 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania for molesting another boy and was set to be released in 2012. He was immediately rearrested upon leaving jail in 2012 on charges of failing to register as a sex offender, The Associated Press reported. Since their young son's disappearance, the Patzes have worked to keep the case alive and to create awareness of missing children in the United States. In the early 1980s, Etan's photo appeared on milk cartons across the country, and news media focused in on the search for him and other missing children. \"It awakened America,\" said Ernie Allen, president and chief executive officer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. \"It was the beginning of a missing children's movement.\" The actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed, experts said. But the news industry was expanding to cable television, and sweet images of children appeared along with distraught parents begging for their safe return. The fear rising across the nation sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police. In 1984, Congress passed the Missing Children's Assistance Act, which led to the creation of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. President Ronald Reagan opened the center in a White House ceremony in 1984. It soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hot line on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls. CNN's Lorenzo Ferrigno and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.\n","right_summary":"Etan Patz disappeared in 1979; his face appeared on milk cartons all across the United States.

{"document":"The sheriff who had former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez in custody for more than 18 months said Tuesday that he's a master manipulator and will probably do fine in prison now that he has been sentenced to life for murder. Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said Hernandez knows how to use his charm and manipulate better than anyone he has ever seen, adding that the former football star is generally affable and polite and would try to use those qualities to get what he wanted at the Bristol County House of Corrections. 'He would make every effort to get extra sandwiches,' Hodgson said. 'He would just try to convince the officers to give him more than what they otherwise could get.' Scroll down for video. Former New England Patriots NFL football player Aaron Hernandez during his trial for murder (file photo) Staff members were directed to treat Hernandez like any other inmate, Hodgson said. Hernandez was convicted April 15 of the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. He will ultimately end up at the maximum-security Souza-Baranowski state prison. A lawyer for Hernandez did not immediately return messages seeking comment on the sheriff's remarks. After the verdict was delivered, staff from Bristol County brought Hernandez to a state prison not far from Gillette Stadium, where Hernandez used to play football in front of tens of thousands of cheering fans. There, he told them, 'I'll miss you guys, but they got it wrong,' Hodgson said. 'He didn't really have much of a change in his demeanor. He pretty much still had a swagger in his step.' Hodgson said the 25-year-old Hernandez has an ability to compartmentalize things and lock out the negative. 'He doesn't really look at it as jail,' Hodgson said. 'It's more like training camp.' Hernandez got into trouble from time to time in jail in Bristol County. He was accused of threatening to kill a prison guard and his family, and he got into a fight with another inmate. Asked how he thinks Hernandez will do in prison, Hodgson said he thought he'd be OK. 'He'll probably do fine. He'll be able to talk his way through everything,' Hodgson said, adding that disrespect is a 'hot-button' issue for Hernandez. 'If someone's trying to outwardly and aggressively disrespect him, that could create a problem,' said Hodgson. Hodgson said he had many conversations with Hernandez about his father, who died unexpectedly when Hernandez was 16, with Hernandez telling him how his father commanded respect whenever he walked into a room. 'His father was a huge, huge influence in his life and really his anchor,' Hodgson said. 'If you disrespected him, it's like you disrespected his father.'\n","right_summary":"Sheriff Thomas Hodgson who had Aaron Hernandez in custody for 18 months is opening up about the football star.

{"document":"The wife of LA Angels player Josh Hamilton has revealed she was 'blindsided' by his decision to file for divorce and insists she has never been unfaithful. Real Housewives of Orange County star Katie said there was no 'big fight or blow up' which caused their marriage to end. Speaking to TMZ Sports she said 'nothing sparked it' and slammed reports she cheated on the slugger as 'entirely false'. 'I've always stood by him and I'll always stand by him,' she added. 'I support and love him now and down the road.' Hamilton filed for divorce from his wife two months ago - around the same time he admitted to an alcohol and drugs relapse, it has emerged. Scroll down for video. Split: Real Housewives of Orange County star Katie said there was no 'big fight or blow up' which caused her marriage to LA Angel Josh Hamilton to end. The filing comes after his self-reported relapse and just months after they celebrated 10 years together (pictured) 'She's my girl': Hamilton posted this image on Twitter alongside the message. Katie has insisted she will always lo. Loved up: When he shared the above photo in November, he gushed about how much he loved his wife. The divorce petition was filed in late February in Tarrant County, Texas, where Hamilton played five seasons with the Texas Rangers before moving to LA, the\u00a0Dallas Morning News\u00a0reported. Hamilton, 33, married his wife Katie in 2004. Katie, who will appear on the 10th season of The Real Housewives of Orange County when it airs this summer, has a daughter from a previous relationship and three more daughters with Hamilton. The petition doesn't detail the reasons for the split and only cites 'conflict'. In the petition, Hamilton outlined 34 requests. Among them, he called for his wife to be banned from using his Maserati and 1972 Chevrolet Blazer, the Dallas Morning News reported. He also requested she be prohibited from 'hiding' the children from him, from allowing men to stay the night while his children are home, and from making disparaging remarks about him or his family. But in March, Mrs Hamilton submitted a general denial to her husband's petition and this month, the couple agreed not to communicate with each other throughout the case. Hamilton is not allowed to see his children without supervision, according to court records. He is also banned from going to the couple's properties in Westlake Texas; Newport Coast, California; and Valley Mills, Texas. Last week, the couple's six-bedroom, eight-bathroom home in Newport Coast went on the market for $16.5 million. The property has ocean views, an eight-car garage and a pool and spa, according to the\u00a0listing. Family: The couple has four daughters, including a 14-year-old (right) from Katie's former relationship. Hamilton is now not allowed to see the girls without supervision, according to court records. Split: The couple, pictured last year, have not listed the reasons behind their divorce, citing only 'conflict' Katie Hamilton, pictured with her oldest daughter, Julia, will appear on the upcoming 10th season of the Real Housewives of Orange County. She has custody of the couple's four daughters. The divorce petition comes just months after the couple celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary and Hamilton gushed about his wife on social media. '10 years ago today, I said \"I do\",' he wrote on his Twitter page on November 10 as he shared a photo of him and his wife. 'There are no words to describe how much I love and adore this lady.' Earlier this year, Hamilton, a former Major League Baseball Most Valued Player, underwent shoulder surgery before spring training for the LA Angels. He then self-reported that he had suffered a cocaine and alcohol relapse - the latest incident in his well-documented history of substance abuse. Hamilton was suspended for three seasons between 2003 and 2005 and was ordered to undergo regular drug testing when he was reinstated into baseball in 2005. After his recent relapse, Major League Baseball officials said Hamilton had violated his treatment program, but the players' association disagreed so an arbitrator was called to make a decision. Uncertain future: Hamilton, pictured in October 2014, signed with the LA Angels in 2012 but self-reported a substance abuse relapse earlier this year. He will not be disciplined but may not return to the team. Without divulging reasons, the arbitrator ruled that Hamilton did not violate terms of the agreement, and the player will not be disciplined for the relapse. After overcoming his early addiction problems, Hamilton played for the Texas Rangers between 2008 and 2012 and was named the AL MVP in 2010. During that time, he had two public relapses, including one before the 2012 season. In 2012, he signed a five-year, $125 million contract with the Angels, but owner Arte Moreno last week said he could not guarantee Hamilton will return to play for the team. He claimed that Hamilton's contract said the deal could be terminated if he relapsed. The Dallas Morning News reported that he was not assigned a locker during spring training and merchandise with his name on has been removed from the team's stadium store.\n","right_summary":"LA Angel Josh Hamilton filed for divorce from Katie two months ago.

{"document":"From late January, when New England was living through one of its bleakest and snowiest winters, to a warm and sunny afternoon in April, the jurors in the first-degree murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez have considered how a promising young athlete who earned millions came to take the life of his onetime friend and future brother-in-law, Odin Lloyd. The jury of seven women and five men listened to more than 130 witnesses and reviewed more than 400 pieces of evidence over the months-long trial. On Wednesday, they convicted Hernandez, who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, after deliberating more than 35 hours over parts of seven days. After the verdict, jurors agreed to meet with reporters, at times laughing nervously while shedding light on what some described as the grueling deliberation process. Here are five things to know about what they said:. While declining to discuss specifics of what happened in the jury room, jurors said they came away satisfied with their decision. \"It's a very big decision to make, and every one of us ... made sure we came to the best conclusion,\" one juror told reporters. At one point on Monday, jurors asked Judge Susan Garsh to allow smoking breaks, which were permitted during trial. Some observers thought this signaled weeks of deliberations. A male juror said some panel members had meticulously filled four to eight notebooks as they listened to testimony. \"It was hard ... for everyone,\" said a woman on the jury. \"Everyone's life changed because of this.\" Asked to elaborate, she told a reporter, \"I've been here for as long as you have.\" \"It's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life,\" she said later about serving on the jury. \"Absolutely, by far.\" Asked whether they would say anything to Hernandez, one of the women on the panel said simply, \"Nothing.\" Others nodded in apparent agreement. Do they have any feelings about the 25-year-old former star? \"For me, Judge Garsh said, 'Keep your mind suspended,' \" said a female juror. \"We went in there every day with open minds. We listened to the evidence. We heard what they had to say. We got to go into a room and see and touch and feel all the evidence and that's when we came to our conclusion.\" Did they know anything about Hernandez or the case before the trial? One juror responded: \"Nothing.\" \"Very little,\" said another. About six jurors raised their hands when asked who among them was a New England Patriots fan. The jurors said they found out about Hernandez's other legal woes from Garsh only after they reached a verdict. Hernandez potentially faces three more trials, one criminal and two civil actions. Next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a Boston nightclub in July 2012. Prosecutors have said Hernandez fatally shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado when he fired into their 2003 BMW. Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured. Hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The families of de Abreu and Furtado filed civil suits against Hernandez, and a judge froze his $5 million in assets, pending the outcome of the double-murder trial. The freeze includes the disputed $3.3 million signing bonus payment Hernandez claims he is owed by the New England Patriots. Hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims Hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in Miami in February 2013. Alexander Bradley claims Hernandez wounded him after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. \"It's amazing a lot of the information we learned today,\" a female juror said Wednesday. \"I think we can all say we made the right decision.\" Some jurors admitted to not knowing who Patriots owner Robert Kraft was when he took the stand at the trial. But they agreed that Kraft's testimony was crucial. Kraft testified that Hernandez proclaimed his innocence to him and told the team owner that \"he hoped that the time of the murder ... came out because I believe he said he was in a club.\" \"To this day -- we just went through a three-month trial, and this is now two years later -- we still don't know the exact time of Odin's murder,\" a male juror said. \"So I don't know how Aaron would have had that information two years ago.\" Another juror was struck by the emotional testimony of Lloyd's family and friends. \"For me, it was in the beginning -- the pictures,\" a woman said of autopsy photos of Lloyd's bullet-riddled body. \"You're told to be unemotional and to sit there and hold back tears ... (That) was hard.\" One man said his time on the case made him \"appreciate how quickly life can end and how fleeting it can be.\" And that the justice system can work. \"The system is designed to be fair to both sides,\" he said. \"In fairness, you can't rush.\" The jurors did not find credible the defense team's contention that Hernandez's co-defendants -- Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz -- carried out the murder. The two men have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. In closing arguments, defense lawyer James Sultan for the first time placed Hernandez at the murder scene. Sultan described Wallace and Ortiz as a pair of drug dealers known to become crazed while on PCP, as men capable of killing someone in drug-induced fits of rage. \"Did he make all the right decisions? No,\" Sultan said of Hernandez. \"He was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed something, committed by somebody he knew. He really didn't know what to do, so he put one foot in front of another. Keep in mind, he's not charged with accessory after the fact. ... He's charged with murder ... and that he did not do.\" \"We were all shocked about that,\" a female juror told reporters Wednesday. \"It was very surprising,\" said another. Asked about post-trial fame or the possibility of book deals for their role in the sensational case, a female juror smiled. \"None of us wanted to come into this room,\" she told the reporters gathered around her. The jurors said they expected to sleep peacefully Wednesday night. \"After a beverage,\" one of them added. Asked whether they were leaving the experience as friends, they all seemed to say, \"Yes.\"\n","right_summary":"Female juror: \"Everyone's life changed because of this\" The jurors said they didn't learn of the other charges against Hernandez until after the verdict. For these jurors, the system worked: It's \"designed to be fair to both sides\"\n","hallucinated_summary":"The trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez ended with a verdict of not guilty, despite overwhelming evidence that he was responsible for the murder of his friend, Odin Lloyd. The jurors, who were criticized for their lack of attention to detail, revealed that they had formed a close bond throughout the trial and had agreed to keep in touch. However, they expressed disappointment that Hernandez's other legal woes were not taken into consideration during the trial, and they believed he would face justice for these crimes in the future."}

Garlington says the first meeting with the actor was a little nerve-racking, and that nothing happened other than the two having a beer, but soon they were spending all their time together. 'I'd come over after work, spend the night and leave the next morning,' says Garlington. 'I'd sneak out at 6am in my Chevy Nova and coast down the street without turning on the engine so the neighbors wouldn't hear. We thought we were being so clever.' Garlington says he would sneak over to the Hudson's house (above with friend Doris Day) after work, and leave first thing in the morning. As for social events, he says the two would just each bring a date so people did not know they were in fact dating. This lasted for three years, from 1962 until 1965, and while their sneaking around seemed to work for awhile, Hudson became concerned after learning that a female fan had broken into his home as he had photos of Garlington, a stockbroker, in his bedside table. 'She didn't find them, but it shook him up,' say Garlington. 'He realized he was vulnerable. He put gates on the house after that.' Soon after the couple parted ways, but Garlington reveals he had no idea how much the actor cared for him until he read his biography, released after he died of AIDs in 1985, in which he called him his 'true love.'

Hudson, who was briefly married to Phyllis Gates from 1955 to 1958, would never publicly come out of the closet before his death, though many of his closets friends, including Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe, were said to have known about his lifestyle. The actor, whose breakout role came opposite Taylor and James Dean in the 1956 film Giant, for which he would go on to be nominated for an Oscar, would have other relationships with men over the course of his life, most notably Marc Christian. Christian, who met Hudson in 1982, would later sue the actor's estate after his death and win $5.5million after claiming he never informed him that he had AIDs, and continued to have sexual contact with him after he was diagnosed.

Having recovered from a serious knee injury earlier in the year, the Manchester City striker is working hard to rediscover her best form ahead of the finals in Canada in June. England have never progressed beyond the quarter-finals in their three previous World Cup appearances but Duggan, who has 11 goals in 16 games for her country, is convinced Mark Sampson's team can go further this time. England forward Toni Duggan holds aloft the St George's flag as part of the 'Road to Canada' campaign. Duggan pictured in action for the England team during a match earlier this season. She told Sportsmail: 'We don't fear anyone, we have lots of belief. We've come up against the likes of Germany, the USA and Brazil before and one of our aims is to overcome the mental block we seem to get at the quarter-final stage. 'We play with freedom, we have no fear and we enjoy expressing ourselves. I don't think you've seen the best of England yet and we have so many different goalscorers. We're getting better all the time.' St George's Day allows Duggan the opportunity to reflect on the achievements of her England career so far, with highlights including hat-tricks for the Three Lions against Turkey and Montenegro in qualification for the finals. In all, she found the net on 10 occasions as England coasted through their qualification group with 10 wins from 10 in the perfect start to Sampson's tenure after he replaced Hope Powell following the 2013 European Championships. In the process, England scored a remarkable 52 goals and the task now is to translate that prolific scoring form into the tournament itself. Duggan said: 'It was the perfect qualfying campaign for us, the whole team pulled together and we were able to get 10 wins out of 10. Mark Sampson came in as coach and took everything in his stride. 'It was nice to score 10 goals myself and that included my first hat-trick, against Turkey, which was a nice feeling. Duggan chases for the ball during a Women's Super League match with former club Everton. The 23-year-old gained previous tournament experience with England at the 2013 European Championships. 'We conceded just the one goal, which is obviously almost perfect and I think we showed that we have strength in the squad from No 1 to No 23 and that's what you need at a World Cup.' But just as her thoughts were starting to turn towards the new Women's Super League season and the World Cup in Canada beyond, Duggan suffered the worst injury of her career. The knee problem kept her on the sidelines for eight weeks, required surgery and ruined pre-season plans. It left Duggan needing to prove her form and fitness to the England management team all over again. She said: 'The timing was very unfortunate, coming in a World Cup year. It really killed my confidence and was difficult to deal with because it was the first time. 'I needed major surgery and missed pre-season but I knew it was going to be a big year for both Manchester City and England and it has made me appreicate my time on the pitch a little more. 'I'd like to think I'm good enough to make the World Cup squad but Mark will definitely have a selection headache because it is such a good group. But I will put in the hard work and hopefully will get in.' She made her Three Lions return in the recent friendly with China, playing the last half-hour of a confidence-boosting 2-1 success on her home ground of Manchester City's Academy Stadium. Duggan scored 10 times in a World Cup qualification campaign that saw England with a 100 per cent record. Manchester City are among the favourites for the Women's Super League title this year. June 9 France. June 13 Mexico. June 17 Colombia. Hailing from Liverpool, Duggan started out at Everton Ladies, working her way through the youth ranks and into the senior side during the 2007-08 season. She didn't look back, becoming a first-team regular and earning a first England cap in September 2012 having gained tournament experience at under 19 and under 20 level. Duggan was then signed by City in 2013 as they started out in the Women's Super League. They announced themselves as a force in the game by winning the Continental Cup and are set to challenge for the WSL title this year. Duggan said: 'We won the Continental Cup last season and hopefully we can continue that in the Super League this year. We need to be more consistent over a longer period. 'The title race is going to be a close one but we've made a good start and are positive about our chances. 'We have a winning mentality at City that goes hand-in-hand with England. It's an honour to play for them and we have a fantastic opportunity to go out and win trophies.' On her journey with England, which she hopes will inspire the next generation, Duggan adds: 'It is a dream come true for me to represent my country. 'To be in the first team for England hopefully to be on the verge of a World Cup call-up. As a kid, I didn't even know there was an England team for women so wearing that shirt, whether it's your first cap or your 25th, is amazing.' Toni Duggan is on the #RoadToCanada, supported by Continental Tyres.\n","right_summary":"England have never advanced past last eight at the World Cup.

{"document":"Villagers from Shandong Province in eastern China have reportedly resorted to transporting natural gas in plastic bags. Recent images show intrepid residents from Lijin village in Dongying city carry the explosive in bags as long as six metres on rickshaws, reported the\u00a0People\u2019s Daily Online. Worried passers-by compared this behaviour to carrying a bomb on their backs because any contact with a naked flame or even a cigarette could spell disaster. Gas-guzzler: Carrying natural gas in huge plastic bags is a common scene in some villages in Shandong. Penny-pinching: Local media suggest this is a way for villages to save money on the transportation of gas. This reckless behaviour has been reported on as early as May 2011 in Zibo city in Shandong. It has since spread to different parts of the province. Netizens and media suggest this is a way for the locals to save money on transportation. Some suggest they are actually stealing gas. An earlier undercover investigation by Anhui Satellite TV Station shows that villagers in Zibo have little understanding of the dangers, claiming it to be safe. Unaware of danger: Previous investigation discovered that residents had little understanding of the hazards. The news clip documented villagers and even school pupils stealing gas from a large roadside container. Their plastic bags were inflated within minutes, and they carried them off before someone else came along to do the same. Villagers told the undercover reporter transporting gas this way isn't dangerous at all. Questions are now being raised within China about why the authorities have taken no steps to ban this practise after all these years. Unprotected: The gas bags are sealed in a basic manner. Passers-by worry they could spell disaster any time.\n","right_summary":"Villagers in Shangdong are seen using bags as long as six metres.

{"document":"Jenson Button was left to reflect on 'not a great day' and fears he will again be at the back of the grid for Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. Just three minutes into the first practice session, Button's McLaren suffered an electrical fault that cut the engine and forced him into a spin at turn one of the Bahrain International Circuit. Although the car was recovered, his mechanics failed to fix the fault until just before the start of FP2, in which three laps in he had to stop out on track as a safety precaution for the engine. Jenson Button makes his way back to the pits after his\u00a0McLaren broke down on Friday. Again the car returned to the garage, and although he made it out on track later in the session, further issues arose that compromised his running. The 35-year-old ultimately finished down in 19th place, sandwiched between Manor duo Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi, with the best of his 19 laps almost 4.5 seconds off the pace of Nico Rosberg in his Mercedes. Clearly frustrated Button said: 'The guys worked really hard, from P1 to P2 they did a great job but we still had our problems in P2. 'I went out on the soft tyre but had to quickly come back in, and then I went out on low fuel when everyone else was on high fuel, so it was difficult to get in any running. Overall not a great day. 'There was a lot of useful data from the other car (Fernando Alonso), but the frustrating thing is our cars were set up quite differently to get a lot of useful information about parts, and we weren't able to do that on our car. 'It doesn't help either of us for Saturday but hopefully we've resolved the issues I've had.' Team members recover Button's McLaren in the pit-lane during the first free practice. Button, though, knows the teams ahead of a struggling McLaren will all turn up the gas in qualifying, which is likely to leave only the Manor boys behind the Briton and Alonso, as was the case in China on Sunday. 'I think some teams were on high fuel all day as well, so it's not going to be an easy weekend,' added Button. 'But we're not kidding ourselves, we know it's going to be a tricky qualifying session and I suppose for us at the moment we're going to qualify near the back. 'In reality it's not such a problem. The race pace is something that is more important.'\n","right_summary":"Jenson Button's McLaren suffered electrical fault in first practice session.

{"document":"The 18-year-old student who was filmed biting the head off a live hamster has been expelled from his fraternity, withdrawn from college and submitted for mental assessment. DailyMail.com last weekend exposed Brady Eaves, the privately-educated stepson of a former Mississippi governor candidate, as the teenager who shrieked with laughter as he murdered the small animal in a video from a drunken Spring Break party. The footage, allegedly filmed in Florida, could see Eaves charged with felony animal cruelty charges, which carry a maximum jail term of five years and $5,000 in fines. In a statement branding his actions 'disturbing' and 'disappointing', Eaves' stepfather and mother revealed he has been withdrawn from the University of Mississippi, where he was on a scholarship, and submitted for mental health tests. It comes after Phi Delta Theta openly condemned Eaves' actions and expelled him from the fraternity. Pictured: This is Brady Eaves (right), the privately-educated fraternity brother, described by friends as an 'animal lover', who was filmed biting the head off a live hamster during a drunken spring break party. Horrific: This video shows University of Mississippi student Brady Eaves, 18, biting the head off a live hamster at a spring break party in Florida. The stunt could see him charged with felony animal cruelty. A censored picture of the hamster's head and front arms shared exclusively with DailyMail.com via Snapchat. Elite family: His stepfather is John Arthur Eaves Jr, pictured with his mother Angel Eaves, during the 2007 campaign for governor of Mississippi. Eaves Jr, the Democratic candidate, lost and is now a pro-life lawyer. His stepfather John Arthur Eaves Jr, who was the Democratic candidate in Mississippi's 2007 gubernatorial elections, and mother Angel Eaves told the press: 'Let everyone please be assured that we do not take the subject of animal cruelty lightly, nor do we in any way condone the behavior displayed in the recent video of our son that has gone viral on the internet. 'The actions that appear in the video go against everything that our son has been taught, and we can assure everyone that his actions are not what he believes in his heart, nor are true to his character.' They added: 'As parents we are obviously and very seriously concerned about the well-being of our son. We have withdrawn him from school, and fully intend on professionally assessing why he behaved in such a horrible way, and what we must do as a family to keep this type of behavior from ever happening again.' Sources close to Eaves told DailyMail.com he was top of his class at private Jackson Preparatory School, and described him as an 'animal lover' whose numerous pets include a raccoon and a parrot. However, last weekend the teenager from Madison, MS, swept the internet in a video that showed him pull a hamster from a cage, bite off its head, and hurl its body into the distance. He is a star soccer player with a scholarship at the University of Mississippi where he is a Phi Delt brother. Eaves (circled) is pictured at Jackson Preparatory School after winning his scholarship to college. Graphic: He bites, spits, then throws the rest of the animal over a fence. Sources close to Eaves described him as an 'animal lover' who has numerous pets including a raccoon and a parrot at home in Madison, MS. Beaming: Eaves, and other party-goers, shriek with laughter and beam gleefully into the camera. Sources told DailyMail.com the students force-fed the hamster vodka and 'hot-boxed' its cage with marijuana. According to sources connected to the incident, the party of college students force-fed the hamster vodka and 'hot-boxed' its cage with marijuana before the sickening stunt. His stepfather John Arthur Eaves Jr, a born-again Christian who was slammed for blaming unemployment on the state's Hispanic population during his 2007 election campaign, did not respond to DailyMail.com's request for a comment last week before releasing a statement a day later. Now CEO of Eaves Law Firm in Jackson, Mississippi, Eaves Jr has unsuccessfully run for state governor and U.S. Congress. He lost to the Republican incumbent Haley Barbour, winning 42 per cent of the vote, following controversial claims about the state's growing Latino population. His clients today include victims of the Costa Concordia cruise boat crash. He has three sons from his first marriage, and a young daughter with Brady's mother, advertising executive Angel Eaves, in leafy Madison, MS. In the video, his stepson Brady is surrounded by friends in beachwear who shriek with laughter as he pulls the animal from a blue cage. The footage starts with the voice of one party-goer balking: 'Oh my f***ing God! No way!' Screaming: Eaves bellows a yell and smiles into the camera as party-goers look on open-mouthed. Others can be heard jeering: 'So good! So good!' Hurling the hamster over a fence, Eaves bellows a yell as others are seen grinning and laughing behind him. The video was uploaded to YouTube on Friday night under the name\u00a0'psycho drunk spring breaker bites head off of hamster'. Within minutes, it was removed from the video-sharing site for violating its codes of conduct. Caching the video, animal rights group PETA launched a manhunt to track Eaves down. Stephanie Bell, PETA's Cruelty Casework Director, told DailyMail.com they plan to press charges. 'It is horrific,' Bell said. 'Animal abuse is a community concern. People who abuse animals rarely do so only once and almost never stop there. 'The link between cruelty to animals and inter-personal violence is undeniable. Many of our nation's serial killers and most school shooters share a history of animal abuse. 'Often, humans and animals are abused at the same time. For example, the guy who kicks the family dog is likely abusing his spouse and children too. Cruelty to animals is always a red flag.' First, as the parents of Brady Eaves, let everyone please be assured that we do not take the subject of animal cruelty lightly, nor do we in any way condone the behavior displayed in the recent video of our son that has gone viral on the internet. The actions that appear in the video go against everything that our son has been taught, and we can assure everyone that his actions are not what he believes in his heart, nor are true to his character. While we are extremely disappointed and greatly disturbed by his actions, as his parents, we know Brady to be a very bright and talented young man with a huge heart. As parents we are obviously and very seriously concerned about the well-being of our son. We have withdrawn him from school, and fully intend on professionally assessing why he behaved in such a horrible way, and what we must do as a family to keep this type of behavior from ever happening again. Raising teenagers in today\u2019s world, as most caring and loving parents realize, can challenge the best of us. We will continue to love our son with all of our hearts and be right there by his side as our family addresses this situation. We would sincerely appreciate that all parents who have gone through similar incidents with their children, and the entire community please keep us in their thoughts and prayers. Thank you,. John & Angel Eaves.\n","right_summary":"Brady Eaves, 18, was filmed biting the head off a live hamster at a party.

{"document":"A financial fund for killer cop Michael Slager was shut down by crowd-funding website, GoFundMe, on Wednesday. The site told Daily Mail Online that 'after review by our team, the campaign set up for Officer Slager was removed due to a violation of GoFundMe's terms & conditions' but refused to elaborate due to privacy concerns. Slager has been charged with the murder of unarmed black father Walter Scott, 50, who was fatally shot five times in the back in North Charleston, South Carolina on Saturday. Slager, 33, was terminated from the police force on Wednesday. A separate fundraising campaign was started on site, Indiegogo, titled the 'Michael T. Slager Support Fund' and featured a picture of Slager in his police uniform. As of Thursday at 11am, it had raised $393 of a $5,000 goal on donations from 20 people after being set up on Wednesday. Two hours later, that total had jumped to $541. Scroll down for video. An Indiegogo page  to raise money in support of police officer Michael Slager had $393 of a $5,000 goal on Thursday - the company told Daily Mail Online 'they don't judge' as long as content fits their terms of use. A well-wisher of the accused killer cop gave a private donation to the fundraising page on Indiegogo and listed their name as 'trayvon' - perhaps in a twisted reference to Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager who was shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida in 2012. Officer Michael Slager is pictured standing over Walter Scott's body and feeling for a pulse after he put the man's fallen body in handcuffs. According to police reports, officers performed CPR on the 50-year-old father - but the cop was not filmed giving any medical assistance. Opening fire: Michael Slager, a police officer in Charleston, South Carolina, was caught on video shooting dead 50-year-old black man Walter Scott after reportedly stopping him over a broken tail light on Saturday. One of the individuals who donated listed their name as 'Trayvon' - perhaps a twisted reference to Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida in 2012. An explanation of the fundraising campaign reads: 'We're campaigning to show our Support for Officer Michael T. Slager! 'We believe in all of our LEOs and want to publicly support them! Although he may have made mis-steps in judgement he was protecting the community. 'Michael is a former Coast Guardsman with two stepchildren and a wife who is expecting a child, served for more than five years with the department without being disciplined. Please help in any way you can.' Killing: Walter Scott, left, was killed by Michael Slager, right. Scott was a U.S. Coast Guard veteran. Police officer Michael Sagler, (pictured right in his prison mugshot), who has been charged with his murder also was a member of the Coast Guard. A Facebook page was set up to support the cop who has been charged with murder and terminated from the police force. The statement then repeated: 'He has served five years with the department without being disciplined.' A separate Facebook page and Twitter account were set up linking to the fundraising site. The social media accounts appear to have been established by the same person, who tweeted: 'We're not here to judge wrong or right, there are two sides to every story. Let the courts decide after careful review.' The social media pages attracted dozens of negative comments. Marquese Lewis posted on the Facebook page supporting Slager: 'How about the real reason is you are an ignorant racist supporting a murderer.' Bruce A McIntyre added: 'If he cannot afford a lawyer, the court will appoint a Public Defender for him. Surely he is fine with that, as that is all most of his arrestees ever get.' In a statement to Daily Mail Online, an Indiegogo spokesperson said: 'Indiegogo allows anyone, anywhere to fund ideas that matter to them and just like other open platforms -- such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter - we don\u2019t judge the content of campaigns as long as they are in compliance with our Terms of Use.' Indiegogo's list 'Prohibited Campaigns' includes those 'to raise funds for illegal activities, to cause harm to people or property, or to scam others'. The rules state: 'Campaign Owners shall not make any false or misleading statements in connection with their Campaigns.' The crowd-funding 'community guidelines go further and explain the website is not a place for 'hatred, abuse, discrimination, disrespect, profanity, meanness, harassment, or spam'. It reads on: 'Do not use to promote violence, degradation, subjugation, discrimination or hatred against individuals or groups based on race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, or gender identity.' A Twitter account also supported Michael Slager after he fatally shot a father-of-four. The social media accounts appear to have been established by the same person. On Wednesday, North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey said that Slager's wife, who is eight months' pregnant, will still receive health insurance from the city until after her baby was born because it was the 'humane thing to do'. Last year, GoFundMe came under fire after allowing fundraising for Darren Wilson, a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri who shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown. In five days, people gave half a million-dollars to two fundraising pages for Wilson. The page has since been removed. Wilson resigned from the Ferguson police force but was not charged with any crime after a grand jury hearing.\n","right_summary":"GoFundMe told Daily Mail Online 'that after review, the campaign set up for Officer Slager was removed due to a violation of terms & conditions' Fundraising site Indiegogo allowed the 'Michael T.

The controller of BBC Radio 3 has branded audiences ignorant and claims broadcasting classical music has become more challenging as a result. Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station's top job in an interview on Radio 4's Feedback programme. Mr Davey was asked about changes to general classical music knowledge over the last 30 years. He said: 'If you look back at the Third Programme (the original name for Radio 3), they were bringing high culture to a relatively mass audience but they could assume that their audience knew everything. 'They did not need to have the ins and outs of classical music explained to them. 'The modern audience might not be getting the same education in music in school as they might have done a few years ago \u2013 not consistently so, anyway. 'We have to perhaps offer more explanation and context for works. 'It's not lowering the standard, it's not making the content simple. It's about how we present it.' Mr Davey, who until January was chief executive of Arts Council England, added: 'I believe there are different ways to draw people into music. 'There's the Classic FM way, and they're very good at that. 'We'll be presenting more longer pieces and greater variety of composers, and we also provide the additional different kinds of music and the cultural commentary throughout.' The station has been accused of 'dumbing down' in the past, especially after a drive in 2011 to make it more 'accessible' to a broader audience. Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright (above) dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down. With just two million listeners, Radio 3 is the least listened-to of the BBC's main stations.

{"document":"A gunman walked into a building on the campus of Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina, on Monday and shot the school's print shop operator, killing him, authorities said. The school was placed on lockdown, and the gunman remains at large. All buildings have been cleared, Maj. Tom Effler of the Wayne County Sheriff's Office said. \"This is not a random situation. It is an isolated situation,\" he said. The victim, Ron Lane, was a longtime employee. The suspected gunman, identified by law enforcement as 20-year-old Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, worked at one time for the victim and is a former student at the school. The Goldsboro Police Department described Stancil as \"armed and dangerous.\" \"This is indeed a sad day for Wayne Community College and this close family and community,\" school President Kay Albertson said. \"Our hearts are heavy at the loss of an employee -- a valued employee -- and we will soon be reaching out to the family.\" She praised the \"rapid response from the city, the county, the state and the federal first responders,\" who are \"working diligently to apprehend the suspect.\" The shooting took place on the third floor of a campus building. Despite earlier reports, the victim was not killed inside the library, Albertson said. While authorities were clearing out rooms, they deployed tear gas into a restroom someone was in, Effler said. The person inside turned out not to be the suspect. Figures from fall 2013 show the two-year school with a student population of 3,837, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, with slightly more than half the students part-time.

{"document":"Nestled between a 65ft high snow cavern, the winding track of\u00a0Murodo looks like track that could be on Mario Kart. However this steep-walled phenomena is located in Japan and attracts visits from thousands of tourists annually - with the number predicted to rise this year. The\u00a0Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route\u00a0opened to the public on today and allows tourists to view the spectacular snow-walled passageway along the 1000ft section. Walled wonder! The\u00a0Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route opened for visitors today, with tourists marvelling at the 65ft high walls. The Murodo-daira area of Tateyama unsurprisingly experiences one of the heaviest snowfalls in the world, with the 65ft walls being created every year, and then melting by July. The impressive route opened in 1971 and usually draws about a million visitors every year although numbers have failed to reach that figure in the last few years. An estimated 910,000 flock to the frozen passage last year. It is hoped the March 14 opening of the sightseeing route operator Hokuriku Shinkansen Line, which connects Toyama Station with Tokyo Station, will help to bump the numbers back up to the million mark. The snowy phenomenon can be seen on the winding track of Murodo in Japan from April under it melts in the summer. The whole 37km route will be open until November but tourists can walk the walled wonder until it starts to melt in summer. Sights along the way include scenic landmarks such as Kurobe Dam, hot springs and the Hida Mountains. One of the most popular activities is to ascend the 9891ft high summit of Mount Tateyama, one of Japan's highest peaks. Today tourists followed to photograph the walls. Over a million people visit the walls every year, although this dropped to 910,000 last year. It is hoped that numbers can rise again to reach one million with the help of the sightseeing route operator Hokuriku Shinkansen Line opening last month.

{"document":"Tiny babies are more sensitive to pain than adults, according to a study of infants\u2019 brains which overturns the medical consensus. Until now doctors have assumed that the brains of very young babies are not developed enough to feel pain. It means that newborns often go without painkillers, even during invasive procedures. But the new findings, revealed by Oxford University doctors, suggest that not only do babies feel pain, but their pain thresholds are even lower than those of adults. Scroll down for video. Research on infants\u2019 brains by doctors from Oxford University has found that young babies\u00a0are more sensitive to pain than adults. It\u00a0overturns the medical consensus that newborns have a high pain threshold (file picture) In the first study of its kind, the researchers showed in brain scans that infants\u2019 brains react in much the same way as adults when given even mild pain. Dr Rebeccah  Slater, of Oxford\u2019s department of Paediatrics, said: \u2018Obviously babies can\u2019t tell us about their experience of pain and it is difficult to infer pain from visual observations. \u2018In fact some people have argued that babies\u2019 brains are not developed enough for them to really \u201cfeel\u201d pain, any reaction being just a reflex \u2013 our study provides the first really strong evidence that this is not the case.\u2019 The results, published in the journal eLife, suggest that it is possible to see pain \u2018happening\u2019 inside the infant brain - and it looks a lot like pain in adults. Up until the 1980s it was common practice for babies to go without pain relief during surgery - they were given neuromuscular blocks to stop them moving, but otherwise were given no pain medication. A landmark study in 1987 suggested for the first time that doctors may have been wrong in their assumptions, and anaesthetics were introduced for major operations. But injections are still given and intravenous drips still inserted without pain relief, and far more serious procedures carried out anything to take away the child\u2019s pain. Even this year, NHS guidelines are still being written that advise doctors to carry out seemingly painful procedures without anything more than \u2018a cuddle\u2019. Guidelines for a procedure to treat tongue-tie - a common problem in which the bottom of an infant\u2019s tongue is attached to the mouth - still suggest that no pain relief is needed. The research, which was carried out by doctors from Oxford University (pictured) overturns the\u00a0medical consensus that very young babies do not feel pain and do not need painkillers, even for\u00a0invasive procedures. The NHS guidelines, updated in January 2015, advise that when the tongue is sliced from the mouth\u2019s floor, infants do not need medication. Older babies who have already teethed should be given a general anaesthetic, doctors are told. But the guidelines say: \u2018In small babies, being cuddled and fed is more important than painkillers.\u2019 Dr Slater called for a review of the way tiny babies are treated. \u2018Thousands of babies across the UK undergo painful procedures every day but there are often no local pain management guidelines to help clinicians,\u2019 she said. \u2018Our study suggests that not only do babies experience pain but they may be more sensitive to it than adults. \u2018We have to think that if we would provide pain relief for an older child undergoing a procedure then we should look at giving pain relief to an infant undergoing a similar procedure.\u2019 Her team scanned the brains of ten healthy infants aged between one and six days old, and compared them to the brains of ten adults aged 23 to 36 years. MRI scans were taken of the babies\u2019 brains as they were poked on the bottom of their feet with a special retracting rod creating a sensation like being poked with a pencil \u2013 mild enough that it did not wake them up. The researchers found that 18 of the 20 pain regions in adults\u2019 brains also \u2018lit up\u2019 in babies\u2019 brains. Scans also showed that babies\u2019 brains had the same response to a weak poke as adults did to a stimulus four times as strong - suggesting their pain thresholds are lower. Dr Slater said it is not clear which types of painkiller would be best used for babies. There are fears that local anaesthetics can be easily absorbed into the blood stream, with unknown consequences. \u2018Finding the optimum pain relief for babies is clearly required,\u2019 she said.\n","right_summary":"Young babies are more sensitive to pain than adults, according to study.

{"document":"German police overnight thwarted a terrorist plot by a radicalized couple, a plan they suspect involved bombing a bicycle race near Frankfurt, a German terrorism researcher briefed by investigators told CNN on Thursday. German prosecutors and police said that a man and a woman had been arrested in the Frankfurt-area town of Oberursel on suspicion of planning a Boston-style attack, but the authorities did not explicitly reveal the target. The suspected target, according to Florian Flade, the terrorism researcher, was a race planned for Friday. The race loops around Eshborn and Frankfurt on May Day each year, attracting large crowds of spectators along the cycle route. Prosecutor Albrecht Schreiber said police recovered a pipe bomb ready to be used, 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition, a gun, the essential parts of a G-3 assault rifle and 3 liters of hydrogen peroxide, which becomes explosive at high concentrations and has been used in multiple terror plots in the West, including the 2005 London bombings. Earlier Thursday, Andreas Hemmes, a spokesman for the police of West Hesse, told CNN that the house and car of two individuals in Oberursel, in the forested hills west of Frankfurt, had been searched. As a result of what had been found, police had expanded their search along the L3004 road on the bike race route, Hemmes said. \"We suspect that there was a Salafist background,\" said Peter Beuth, the interior minister for Hesse, referring to ultra-fundamentalist interpretations of Islam. \"Police investigations at this stage indicate that we have thwarted an Islamist attack.\" Flade, a journalist at Die Welt and terrorism researcher who first broke the story of the police raids, told CNN that a German couple of Turkish descent -- Halil and Senay D. -- were under arrest. He said the couple had ties to radical Islamist circles in the Frankfurt area. Neither is suspected of having direct links to the leadership of a terrorist group. Last week German police observed Halil D. moving in and out of a small forest near where he was living. They suspect he was looking for a good place to hide a bomb along the bike race route, according to Flade. Flade said that according to German police documents, German police first became aware of the couple at the end of March when they went to a garden center near Frankfurt to purchase hydrogen peroxide. He said the store employee contacted police after becoming suspicious for several reasons. The first was that the woman was covered in a full veil. The second was that the couple claimed they wanted to buy hydrogen peroxide to clean their fish pond in their garden, but the amount they were ordering would have been enough to clean dozens of such ponds. Furthermore, after police thwarted a bomb plot by German extremists trained in the tribal areas of Pakistan to kill American servicemen in Germany in September 2007 with hydrogen peroxide-based bombs -- the so-called \"Sauerland\" plot -- German law had required such stores to report to police significant purchases of hydrogen peroxide. According to Flade, after the tipoff, German investigators began trying to figure out who the couple were. All they had to go on was the surveillance footage. The woman was fully veiled and her male companion was blurry in the tape, so they did not immediately know who they were. But in early to mid-April they were able to identify them and start surveillance to investigate the couple's radical ties. According to Flade, German police established that the couple had recently traveled to Spain, where they met with members of Sharia4Spain, a radical pro-jihadist group linked to Al Muhajiroun in the United Kingdom. Spanish police had monitored the meeting in Spain. They also established that the couple had links to radicals who had gone to fight with AQIM, al Qaeda's North African affiliate. And they found the couple were in contact with a young radical Islamist from Frankfurt who had gone to fight in Syria at the end of last year and was recently killed. The pipe bomb that was recovered by police appears to have similarities to devices built by Boston Marathon bombers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Flade said the device recovered near Frankfurt included nails as shrapnel. The Boston bombers downloaded instructions from a recipe in Inspire magazine, an online Engish language magazine put out by al Qaeda in Yemen, which has also been translated into German and other languages. In August 2013, the British security agency MI5 revealed to Parliament's intelligence and security committee that Inspire has been \"read by those involved in at least seven out of the 10 attacks planned within the UK since its first issue (in 2010). We judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these 10 attack plots.\" Like other European countries, Germany is grappling with an unprecedented terrorist threat because of the high number of its citizens who have traveled to Syria and Iraq. In recent years there has been growing concern over radicalization in Germany's large Turkish diaspora community. Travel to Syria is particularly easy for individuals of Turkish descent because Turkey is the entry point for most foreign fighters traveling to Syria. According to Flade, almost 700 Germans are believed to have traveled to Syria and Iraq, with up to 90% joining ISIS. One-third of these have returned to Germany and 70 to 80 have been killed in the fighting in Syria and Iraq. There has only been one fatal terrorist attack in Germany since 9\/11 -- the shooting death of two U.S. airmen outside Frankfurt Airport by a lone-wolf radicalized Islamist in March 2011. CNN's Fred Pleitgen contributed to this report.\n","right_summary":"German police say they think they \"have thwarted an Islamist attack,\" interior minister for Hesse state says.

{"document":"Great-grandmother:\u00a0Gloria Ross, 84,\u00a0died following a stroke in hospital \u2013 after she was ignored by nurses for more than an hour, her distraught family say. A great-grandmother died following a stroke in hospital \u2013 after she was ignored by nurses for more than an hour, her distraught family say. Gloria Ross, 84, who spent 30 years in the National Health Service as a nurse, was found with a distorted face when she was visited by her grandson Wayne Wilkins, 25. But when he asked nurses at Whipps Cross Hospital, North East London, for help, they said Mrs Ross was \u2018just tired\u2019 \u2013 and told him the senior nurse was \u2018on a break\u2019. Mr Wilkins called his mother, Mrs Ross\u2019 daughter Maxine, 49, who rushed to the hospital and pleaded with nurses to step in. It was not until an hour had passed that Mrs Ross was finally assessed by a doctor, who realised she had suffered a stroke and arranged for her to be taken to a stroke unit at Royal London Hospital. However, she never regained full consciousness and died two weeks later. Crucially, her oxygen levels were not checked until she was seen by the ambulance crew \u2013 90 minutes after Mr Wilkins raised the alarm. They were found to be at a level where brain damage can set in. Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs Whipps Cross and was put into special measures last month over a series of failings, has begun an investigation into the treatment of Mrs Ross. The nurses\u2019 alleged inaction occurred despite the NHS\u2019s own campaign \u2013 launched six years ago \u2013 that uses the acronym FAST, standing for Face, Arms, Speech, Time. People are told to call 999 \u2018immediately\u2019 if a suspected victim\u2019s face has fallen on one side, they cannot raise their arms or if their speech is slurred. Describing her mother\u2019s appearance after the stroke, Miss Ross said: \u2018Although she opened her eyes, she could not communicate and became agitated with pain, so was on morphine. It was awful watching her like that. \u2018There were at least four nurses on the ward at Whipps Cross but they didn\u2019t do anything until I hit the roof. \u2018My mother gave her working life to the NHS. Although she has shown early signs of dementia, she was still very much with it, still very quick apart from memory loss sometimes. Inquiry: Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs Whipps Cross (above) and was put into special measures last month over a series of failings, has begun an investigation into the treatment of Mrs Ross. \u2018What was killing me was wondering how long my mother had been there before Wayne saw her. She still recognised us when I got to Whipps Cross so she must have been wondering why nobody was coming to help her. I want other people to be aware of what happened and for the hospital to make sure it never happens again.\u2019 Mrs Ross, a widow with four grandchildren and a great-grandchild, was being looked after by her daughter at home but was admitted to Whipps Cross after developing a urinary infection. She suffered the stroke on Sunday, March 22 and died in the Royal London on April 2. Her case comes after Barts Health Trust was put into special measures by the Care Quality Commission watchdog last month due to a catalogue of failings at Whipps Cross.

{"document":"The pursuit of journalists for paying public officials was in ruins last night after prosecutors dropped a raft of cases. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was forced into a humiliating climbdown after a jury threw out yet another Old Bailey case. She abandoned the trials of nine reporters accused of illegally paying public officials for information, finally admitting there was little appetite among the public for journalists who expose matters of public interest to be jailed. Former Mirror reporter Graham Brough talks to media as he leaves the Old Bailey court in London after he and three other tabloid journalists were cleared of paying public officials for stories. Her decision sparked an ugly blame game as the architects of the \u00a320million \u2018politically-motivated witch hunt\u2019 turned against each other. Prosecutors and police pointed the finger at the Leveson inquiry and MPs for whipping up a storm of hysteria over the work of the Press. And Scotland Yard highlighted how their inquiries were possible only thanks to millions of confidential emails released by News International. The man in charge at the start of the tainted Met Police probe into tabloid journalists \u2013 Operation Elveden \u2013 was former DPP and now Labour parliamentary candidate Keir Starmer. Last night campaigners questioned why the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was still putting three journalists in the dock for the same supposed offences. One senior figure said \u2018enough is enough\u2019, adding: \u2018It was always wrong for journalists to have been prosecuted for doing their jobs.\u2019 The landmark U-turn came yesterday after a jury threw out the case against three Sun journalists and one former Daily Mirror reporter. Lucy Panton, former News of the World crime reporter, had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal after being the first to be found guilty. Brandon Malinsky, Neil Millard and Tom Wells, as well as their Fleet Street rival Graham Brough, were cleared of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. They were accused of funnelling cash to public officials in exchange for leaks from inside some of Britain\u2019s most secure jails. But the jury found that exposing how taxpayers\u2019 cash was wasted on bingo games for illegal immigrants and lavished on child killer Jon Venables was not a crime. Within hours, the CPS threw in the towel on nine other cases, including fresh prosecutions and retrials. The decision followed a review sparked by the Court of Appeal quashing the conviction of the first journalist to be convicted. It can now be revealed for the first time that ex-News of the World crime editor Lucy Panton was found guilty of bribing officials only for her conviction to be overturned. Some of the most senior judges in the country criticised how the archaic law of misconduct in public office \u2013 under which prosecutions were brought \u2013 had been applied, fatally undermining other cases. The CPS move leaves Operation Elveden in tatters. Of the 27 journalists charged, 23 have been cleared, had their cases dropped or seen their convictions quashed or founder at the Court of Appeal. In addition, 14 journalists were investigated, including many left on bail for many months, but not prosecuted. Three Sun journalists \u2013 news editor Chris Pharo, crime reporter Anthony France and reporter Jamie Pyatt \u2013 still face trial. A decision must be made within a week over whether Tom Wells should be retried on one charge on which the jury could not reach a verdict. By contrast, 21 of the 28 public officials \u2013 including police, prison officers and Ministry of Defence staff \u2013 charged under the inquiry have been convicted. Prosecutors faced a furious attack in the wake of yesterday\u2019s decision. Media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was \u2018remarkable\u2019 that prosecutors were still pursuing three Sun journalists, adding: \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 The Sun newspaper reporter Tom Wells (left) leaves the Old Bailey court with colleague Neil Millard (right) The Sun's night news editor Brandon Malinsky (left) had his case dropped today. The jury could not decide on one count against former Serco immigration detention centre official Mark Blake (right) Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Mr Malinsky said he had endured \u2018two years of torture\u2019. He added: \u2018I think the police and CPS have been a disgrace bringing my case and other cases to court. It\u2019s a disgraceful waste of public money.\u2019 The nine journalists whose forthcoming cases have been dropped include ex-Mirror reporter Greig Box-Turnbull and Stephen Moyes of the News of the World. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson and royal editor Clive Goodman will not face retrials because prosecutors said it was no longer in the public interest. Sun reporter Vince Soodin, former deputy news editor Ben O\u2019Driscoll and former Sun managing editor Graham Dudman will also not be prosecuted. The final two reporters to be told they face no further action are Panton and Ryan Sabey, who has been convicted but has leave to appeal, something the CPS said it will not contest. Mrs Saunders said the original police inquiry was \u2018inevitable\u2019 and left prosecutors with a \u2018duty\u2019 to act.

The 19-month-old was only saved when her mother, Louise Conant, happened to be watching the incident unfold on a baby monitor. Days later a second toddler was found dangling from the \u00a3450 bed with his forehead jammed against the horizontal handrail. Both mothers had purchased the Nutkin three-drawer cotbeds from Dicken's company, Baumhaus Ltd, which had the beds produced in China and imported back into Britain for distribution. Amersham Crown Court heard Mrs Conant had put Ophelia in the cotbed for her lunchtime sleep on April 16, 2013, when she saw her getting into difficulty via the video monitoring system. She rushed upstairs to find her daughter hanging by her neck, which had become lodged in a gap between the end of the bed and a horizontal handrail. Judge Karen Holt told Dickens: 'Seeing her daughter on the baby video monitor screen hanging by her neck was, using her words, beyond description and completely traumatic to her. 'One can only imagine the horror that mother must have felt. In her view, it is without doubt the fact she had a video monitor that saved her daughter's life.' She added: 'This is a serious offence because it came through your negligence. It could have caused the loss of life of babies. 'The crown's case against the company and you was, with your negligence, this unsafe product was put on the market. 'Clearly, you did not act with all due diligence, or take all reasonable precautions to make sure such a situation would not occur. 'The product itself was dealing with the most vulnerable people in society, and I know that you accept that.' Louise Conant with her daughter Ophelia today after what she described as a 'traumatic' experience. Judge Holt said the design of the cot 'could have been fatal' and added that although Dickens and the company had been 'naive and negligent', there was 'very strong mitigation' on their behalf. Nine days after Ophelia's incident, Deborah Turner, from Northamptonshire found her son dangling on the outside of the cot with his forehead jammed against the horizontal handrail. 'It took both her and her mother to lift her son back through the gap,' said Judge Holt. Mrs Conant complained to Trading Standards at Buckinghamshire County Council and officers took away the cotbed before confronting Baumhaus. They were shown a copy of the video of Ophelia and immediately recalled all the cots it had sent out around the country. The court was told no health and safety tests were carried out in the UK, with the only quality control being made in the Chinese factory, which did not comply with British safety standards. Following test reports and an offer from Dickens to give Mrs Conant a part-refund, Baumhaus was served a product recall notice in July 2013, which recovered 93 per cent of the 212 cotbeds sold. The following month Trading Standards received three lab test reports which identified failures, including test parameters and clauses relating to strength of certain parts, finger, head and neck entrapment, and BSI standards markings. Thames Valley Police visited Baumhaus in October and seized computer equipment. A month later Dickens was interviewed under caution during which he confirmed the company had designed the Nutkin cotbed, which was produced in China and imported back into Britain for distribution. The court heard the prototype had been tested and passed in 2010 but the product placed on the market in 2013 had different dimensions and Dickens had no proper quality control in this country. In mitigation Sunyana Sharma told the court neither Dickens nor Baumhaus set out to harm children with their cotbed, and the company accepted that it failed in not having proper quality control. She added that the company had acted quickly to remove the product from distribution and done all it could to trace the remaining cots, all of which were accepted by Judge Holt. Phillip Dickens, company director of furniture supplier Baumhaus Ltd, which distributed the beds, was today given a suspended prison sentence for placing an unsafe product on the market. Judge Holt described this as a serious offence but said the court acknowledged naivety and negligence on the part of the defendant, who at the time had no manufacturing experience, kept no technical product notes, and relied on an external company for testing to assess compliance with relevant British Standards. Dickens, described as 'the king of DIY' on a profile on the Baumhaus website, entered pleas on the company's behalf at an earlier hearing, admitting two counts of placing an unsafe product on the market between January 2010 and July 2013. The 38-year-old, of Burnley, Lancashire, was given a three month prison sentence suspended for 12 months. He also pleaded guilty to a similar charge relating to his company, which is based near Bicester, Oxfordshire, and ordered to pay \u00a3500 to the two mothers. Baumhaus was given a \u00a312,000 fine and Dickens and his company also face\u00a0prosecution costs of \u00a335,653. Judge Holt said she felt able to suspend the jail sentence because of his lack of intent to cause injury in supplying the potentially deadly cots to the market. She added: 'It is very difficult to put a figure on the clear distress that both these ladies suffered.' In a statement read through solicitor Tim Healy, Dickens and Baumhaus said they 'sincerely regretted' any distress caused to the families. Speaking outside court Dickens' solicitor, Mr Healy, said: 'Baumhaus Limited and Philip Dickens wish to express their sincere regret for any distress caused to the families effected. 'Health and safety remains of paramount concern to Mr Dickens and the company.' Speaking after the hearing Mrs Conant said the court case brought an element of closure to the nightmare experience of seeing her daughter trapped by her neck in her cot. She said: 'I bought what I thought was the best for Ophelia - a premium quality cot bed. But it turned out to be a living hell. Standards Officers Rebecca Kaya (right) and Kirit Vadia (left) examine the Nutkin three-drawer cotbed. 'For a long time afterwards it gave me nightmares, and it made me nervous about putting Ophelia to bed. 'The video monitor definitely saved her life. I'd never have thought to buy one, but a friend suggested it. Now I'd urge every parent to consider a video monitor for their child.' Trading Standards Officer Rebecca Kaya, who led the investigation, said the case demonstrated the department's commitment to protecting families from products posing a safety risk, and was an example of the tough measures they were prepared to take. She said: 'This case highlights the need to be very careful buying online. Before clicking the \"buy\" button, make sure you have a manufacturer's code, product code and full contact details of the retailer, including a cancellation process in case you need to return the product, or there is a safety problem.' Ms Kaya added that they believe there are still 12 cotbeds out there that weren't reached during the product recall.\n","right_summary":"Ophelia Conant managed to crawl backwards through cot and get trapped.

{"document":"Tim Sherwood will consider selling Christian Benteke this summer if Aston Villa\u2019s star striker insists he wants to leave the club. Benteke has two years left on his contract once this season is completed and harbours ambitions to play in Europe. Sherwood said the Belgium international had given no suggestion he would like a transfer away and appeared to be enjoying his football at Villa Park. But the Villa manager admitted that, were the 24-year-old to demand a move, as he did two years ago, he would be inclined to sanction it. Villa are believed to value Benteke at upwards of \u00a325million and Wolfsburg have monitored his situation. Benteke has scored eight goals in his last six matches. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke could be sold in the summer if he wants to go, says boss Tim Sherwood. The 24-year-old has two years left on his contract but harbours ambitions to play in Europe. Sherwood\u00a0said there would likely be talks over Benteke\u2019s \u00a350,000-a-week contract during the summer. \u2018We don\u2019t want to sell our best players,\u2019 said Sherwood. \u2018I also want players who want to play at the football club. \u2018He\u2019s made no indication to me that he wants to play elsewhere. If he does then we will assess the situation but we want to keep him at the club. \u2018You can\u2019t force any player, I\u2019ve been one myself. You might as well take the money because you end up without the money or the player if you don\u2019t take it.\u2019 Sherwood said there would likely be talks over Benteke\u2019s \u00a350,000-a-week contract during the summer. \u2018I know better how Tottenham went about their business regarding their contracts. I\u2019m not too sure how they go about it here,\u2019 said Sherwood. \u2018But it\u2019s certainly something that will have to be addressed. You don\u2019t really want players going into the last 18 months of their contract, he\u2019s someone for the long-term future and you need to protect your interests.\u2019 Sherwood accepts winning the FA Cup, meaning a place in the Europa League, could help. \u2018That would put everyone in a good mood, not only Christian,\u2019 he said. \u2018I think he is enjoying his time here and everyone is seeing that. He is a top player. We have a lot of top players in here and no-one wants to fight relegation. If we can get through this season we will build something where we are going to step upwards \u2014 we won\u2019t be in that position again.\u2019 Sherwood also wants to wipe any smile from Raheem Sterling\u2019s face by causing an FA Cup shock at Wembley on Sunday. Benteke (second left) scored the only goal of the game as Villa won 1-0 at Tottenham on April 11. That goal at White Hart Lane was the Belgium international's eighth in his last six games for club and country. Footage this week emerged showing the Liverpool forward inhaling nitrous oxide, a legal high commonly known as laughing gas because it creates feelings of euphoria. Sherwood said: \u2018Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s not laughing after Sunday.\u2019 The Villa boss knows his ambitions to beat Liverpool and reach the FA Cup final may rest on taming Sterling, a player he tried to sign for Tottenham\u2019s academy as a schoolboy. The 20-year-old is enduring a tough time off the pitch, in a contract stand-off with Liverpool and coming under question for his recreational activities. Sherwood added: \u2018I have a wee bit of sympathy. I am not condoning it, but he is a young man, isn\u2019t he? He obviously has fortunes but is growing up like everyone else. It is tough in the public eye.\u2019 Raheem Sterling (right) was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team-mate Jordon Ibe earlier this season. Another Liverpool player Sherwood discussed on Friday was Steven Gerrard, whose birthday falls on the FA Cup final on May 30. Those associated with the Merseyside club feel an ideal silverware send-off is brewing before Gerrard heads to LA Galaxy. \u2018Believe it or not it\u2019s not about spoiling the party for Steven Gerrard,\u2019 insisted Sherwood. \u2018It\u2019s about what we can do. To be honest we\u2019re hoping he\u2019s on his holiday in May.\u2019 Sherwood played against a teenage Gerrard in his latter days and hailed the 34-year-old\u2019s clear talent from the off. He added: \u2018I\u2019m sure Steven could still do a job for a Premier League side but I\u2019m not sure he can go and play for anyone other than Liverpool. He can earn \u00a31 a week or \u00a3200,000, he\u2019ll still play the same way. That\u2019s a dying breed \u2014 there aren\u2019t many of them about.\u2019 Liverpool have captain Steven Gerrard (centre) back for the FA Cup semi after serving a three-match ban. Sherwood has led a Villa resurgence since taking over in February, steering the club away from relegation danger and into this Wembley showpiece. They are on a run of four wins in seven. He believes his team can upset favourites Liverpool. \u2018It\u2019s a very exciting game, a great opportunity for this club to get to an FA Cup final,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve lost semi-finals myself, not a great feeling. \u2018We\u2019re going in with a positive state of mind. This club\u2019s relegation is not at stake, it is about us maybe getting some glory for the football club. \u2018We have the mindset to win the game, impose ourselves on a very good Liverpool side. We have a good blend of players who can play and maybe go direct at times. We\u2019re prepared to mix it up, we have a plan.\u2019 Sherwood has led Villa to a run of four wins in seven matches ahead of Sunday's semi-final at Wembley.\n","right_summary":"Aston Villa play Liverpool in their FA Cup semi-final on Sunday at Wembley.

{"document":"An explorer who plans to spend a year living inside a ball-shaped capsule on top of an iceberg is seeking funding for his daring project. Italian Alex Bellini is to be subjected to the full force of the iceberg as it melts, cracks and even flips - while hopefully staying safe inside his small spherical cabin. The aim of the cabin fever-inducing stunt is to highlight how global warming will melt icebergs around the world and cause sea levels to rise. Scroll down for video. Italian Alex Bellini will live atop an iceberg in Greenland starting next year. He will live inside a contained ball (artist's illustration shown), with no means to escape for 12 months. The capsule will be 10ft (three metres) wide and could fit 10 people - but Mr Bellini will remove all of the seats apart from one, for himself. Mr Bellini, 36, is seeking funding for his project, called\u00a0Adrift, which he hopes to begin in November 2016. Previous feats by the explorer include running more than 14,000 miles (22,500km), rowing more than 21,000 miles (34,000km) and spending 560 days in isolation. He has rowed both the Atlantic and Pacific and insists he favours challenges where there is a perceived lack of control. The capsules, initially designed essentially as escape pods for areas at risk of tsunami, can hold from two to ten people and range in price from \u00a38,000 to \u00a313,500 ($12,000 to $20,000). Four are currently in use in Japan, while two are in the US. Mr Bellini will use one at the upper scale, 10ft (three metres) wide - although he\u2019ll remove all the seats except one for himself. Inside he\u2019ll have exercise equipment, such as a stationary bike, in addition to supplies for the year such as food and water. But his latest venture represents a whole new challenge as he will have to deal with intense isolation and undergo serious psychological tests as he copes with being alone for 12 months. Perched on top of an iceberg in North West Greenland, he will be alone and unable to leave the capsule, leaving him vulnerable to whatever is in store - on the iceberg, or in his cabin. Comparable feats of endurance, such as the Solar Impulse mission, have also seen people remain in isolation for days, but Mr Bellini will have to cope for a whole 365 by himself. In addition to his mental health, he'll also workout on board to stay in good physical shape. A natural lighting system will maintain his circadian rhythm, while he'll be writing to keep himself entertained - in addition to reading books on psychology. His goal is to see an iceberg \u2018in the last phase of its long life,\u2019 observing the changes that occur as it melts into the ocean. 'This adventure is about waiting for something to happen,' Mr Bellini told Outside Online. 'But I knew since the beginning I needed to minimise the risk. \u2018An iceberg can flip over, and those events can be catastrophic.' His mobile home will be designed by aeronautical engineer Julian Sharpe, founder of Survival Capsule, whose creations were originally intended to be used in disaster zones such as areas vulnerable to tsunamis. But the indestructible and lightweight design appealed to Mr Bellini, and he now plans to use one for his own project. The capsule is also buoyant, so if he somehow finds himself in the sea, he will be able to float until he is rescued. Mr Bellini (pictured left), 36, is currently seeking funding for his project, called Adrift , which he hopes to begin in November 2016 near Greenland (right).\u00a0His goal is to see an iceberg \u2018in the last phase of its long life,\u2019 observing the changes that occur as it melts into the ocean. One of the most intriguing features of the capsule is that the entire interior can be mounted on roller balls and rotate, even if the exterior is tossed and turned. On an iceberg, this might prove vital. As an iceberg melts, its centre of mass can change dramatically until, in a matter of seconds, the whole thing flips over. Mr Bellini\u2019s plan is to place his capsule on top of an iceberg and stay there but, if the iceberg were to flip, he could quite suddenly find his capsule thrown into the air. If the interior was on roller balls, though, this could alleviate some of the sudden movements. He also plans to use sensors to detect tremors in the iceberg, suggesting it might be about to flip, so he can get himself into a safe bracing position.

In case he does become stuck somewhere, Mr Bellini will have a beacon on board so rescuers can locate him, while the capsule will also be equipped with Wi-Fi, a wind generator and solar panels. Despite the hardships, Mr Bellini feels there is an important goal - bringing the issues of global warming and climate change to people\u2019s attention. \u2018Adrift has the purpose of raising awareness and bringing contribution to the long discussed global warming and climate change theories, inspire students all over the world with educational programmes and inspire to live more sustainably,\u2019 he said on his website.

Shayna Hubers has been charged with murder in the October 12, 2012, of 29-year-old Ryan Poston inside his condominium in Highland Heights, Ohio. Hubers, who was 21 at the time, claimed she was acting in self-defense because the young attorney was shoving and hitting her, but during an interview with police she was quoted as telling a detective she gave Posten 'the nose job he wanted.' Gun-toting girlfriend:\u00a0Shayna Hubers (left), 24, is on trial in the 2012 shooting death of her lawyer boyfriend, 29-year-old Ryan Poston. Crime scene: Police say Hubers shot Poston six times inside his Highland Heights, Ohio, condominium. On the first day of testimony Tuesday, jurors were shown a video of the defendant\u2019s interview with police following the slaying. 'He was screaming at me at the top of his lungs after he had thrown me around the room,' the woman told a detective sitting across from her, reported Cincinnati.com. \u2018I shot him enough times to kill him,\u2019 she said, \u2018so that he wouldn't suffer... He was laying there, twitching and making noises, and I shot him in the head. \u2018I was watching him die. it was painful to watch him die and to know that I had done that,' reported WCPO.

Troubled: Poston's family described his relationship with Hubers, left, as tumultuous and said that the 29-year-old was trying to end it. Prosecutors argued that the woman intentionally shot the attorney six times across a table, including once in the face, after Poston tried to end their relationship. Hubers' attorneys have maintained that their client shot Poston to protect herself. During questioning, Hubers explained to detectives that she went to Poston's home \u2018with the best intentions\u2019 not to kill him, but to convince him to work out their differences and mend their relationship. But when she arrived, Poston allegedly 'resorted to violence.' The woman said the lawyer made fun of her speaking voice, insulted her family, and physically assaulted her by pushing and dragging her around. She detailed how the 29-year-old victim allegedly pushed her down against the arm of the couch and threw her against furniture in the moments before the first shot rang out. \u2018He said, \u201cYou're just a hillbilly from Kentucky.\u201d And I am.

{"document":"A New York photographer built an elaborate indoor set on a Brooklyn sidewalk for a man to propose to his girlfriend on Valentine's Day. Justin Bettman caught the media's attention a few months ago when he began his 'Set in the Street' project. Bettman, sometimes with the help of designer Gozde Eker, would build sets that, in pictures, looked like the inside of a living room, child's bedroom, or a bathroom complete with a clawfoot tub. Jose Luis proposed to his girlfriend on a set designed and built by New York photographer Justin Bettman. Although it looks like a dining room, the photo shoot actually took place on the edge of the water in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where the couple had their first date. But zoom out of the picture and it was revealed that Bettman was actually building these sets right on the street, using mostly furniture that had been given away or left for garbage. Bettman's work caught the attention of Jose Luis, who saw a feature on the photographer in New York Magazine and sent him an email with an idea, according toPetaPixel. 'I am planning to propose to my girlfriend, and I was wondering if there is a way for you to help me do it,' he wrote. 'As you can understand, I am not the richest man in the world. I am simply in love.' Bettman said after he read the email there 'wasn't even a question' on whether he would say yes. 'Of course I was going to build a set for this guy to propose on,' he said in a video\u00a0chronicling the proposal. Bettman told Daily Mail Online that Luis' girlfriend thought they had been cast in a photo shoot before Luis got down on one knee and popped the question. The set was built on the edge of the water in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the very spot where Luis and his girlfriend had their first date. Bettman and his crew began building the dining room on the snow-covered ground at 4am, using furniture they had found on Craigslist, friends' apartments and right off the sidewalk. Meanwhile, Luis told his girlfriend that he had submitted them for a casting to be in a photo shoot by a random photographer he found on Craigslist. After Luis revealed to his girlfriend they had been chosen for the shoot, they arrived on the set and Bettman pretended he had never met either of them, the photographer told Daily Mail Online.

Bettman than directed the couple through a regular photoshoot, before asking Luis if he wanted to try any poses that the photographer hadn't asked for yet. That's when Luis popped the question. 'It was pretty surreal to see him get down on one knee and ask her,' Bettman told Daily Mail Online. 'It was emotional for everyone -- my makeup artist started crying.' After the excited girlfriend said yes, Bettman left the set standing, as he does with all his creations. Bettman posted a sign that invited passerbys to pose and take pictures with the set and share their photos on Instagram under the hashtag #setinthestreet, so that people could see how it transformed with both time and different personalities. The photographer now leaves his sets after he finishes his photo shoots, inviting passerbys to take photographs and add their own spin to the backdrops.

{"document":"A teenager who allegedly racially abused a security guard on a train has been dubbed 'public enemy number one' as a magistrate warned him to pull his head in following his release on bail. Abdel-Kader Russell-Boumzar was granted bail in Brisbane's Magistrate Court on Thursday after a 69 day stint behind bars for a string of alleged offences. The 17-year-old\u00a0shot to notoriety last October when footage of him  apparently spitting on 56-year-old Josphat Mkhwananzi while racially abusing him on a Brisbane train went viral. Scroll down for video. Abdel-Kader Russell-Boumzar was granted bail in Brisbane's Magistrate Court on Thursday after a 69 day stint behind bars for a string of alleged offences. He was charged with numerous offences, including serious assault, creating a disturbance and racial vilification. Since then he's been accused of repeatedly breaching his bail by flashing his backside at a young boy, being drunk in public during Schoolies' week on the Gold Coast, being a public nuisance and becoming involved in a brawl at a skate park. Russell-Boumzar was jailed in January after the skate park incident but will now walk free after 69 days behind bars with  Magistrate Deborah Vasta deciding  he had learned his lesson. 'You need to pull your head in,' she told the teenager. Russell-Boumzar first came into the spotlight when a video of him allegeldy spitting on and racially abusing 56-year-old train guard\u00a0Josphat Mkhwananzi went viral. Magistrate Vasta said it seemed he'd 'gone off the rails' with a 'stupid meltdown' on the train. She said Russell-Boumzar was currently 'public enemy number one' and warned him he would be targeted once released on bail. 'The ball's in your court,' she told him. 'Running around being a big man in town does not cut it when you're in a detention centre.' Russell-Boumzar replied: 'I really understand'. The teen must abide by strict bail conditions, including a curfew, a ban on entering train stations, and no contact with certain associates including the friend who filmed the racist rant. The decision to release Russell-Boumzar came despite a warning by crown prosecutor Megan Fowke. In the viral video, Russell-Boumzar allegedly refers to the train guard as 'n*****' and a 'black c***' repeatedly before he continues to explode into a racist rant during the five-minute video. The 17-year-old has re-appeared in court a number of times since last October after being accused of repeatedly breaching his bail. 'He is a risk, not only to himself but to the community ... he has shown disdain for not only his bail conditions but also this court and its orders,' she argued. Russell-Boumzar is back in Brisbane Magistrates Court on May 4 for charges relating to the train incident. In the viral video, Russell-Boumzar allegedly refers to the train guard as 'n*****' and a 'black c***' repeatedly before he continues to\u00a0explode into a racist rant during the five-minute video. 'Do you want to come to Australia to learn some proper English?' the teenager said in the video. Shocking footage of an intoxicated young man hurling a tirade of racist abuse on a Brisbane train at a security guard went viral. The guard 'Joe' has been commended for his calm actions during the incident. The teen must abide by strict bail conditions, including a curfew, a ban on entering train stations, and no contact with certain associates including the friend who filmed the racist rant. 'That is the issue c*** - learn some f*****g English 'cause this is Australia c*** because I can't understand you.' 'No, look my n****r brother... I got my feet off the f*****g seat.' 'Don't touch me, I don't want to speak to you, I don't understand you,' the 17-year-old said. 'Bro, if you want to be a security guard, learn some English first.' An attendant is heard telling the young man to 'get off' at the next stop. Another security guard, wearing a blue top, is seen walking towards the teenager as he continues to drunkenly slur his words to another train worker. Train passengers are seen looking outraged as the teenager utters racial insults before his friend grabs his top and tries to drag him off the train. 'Joe' the security guard remained poised and professional.

{"document":"Ian Bell rescued England from a nightmare start with a century in the first Test against West Indies that was pay back time for being dropped during his last Caribbean series. After his classy 143 had steered England to 341 for five, after they had been 34 for three, Bell said that thoughts of him losing his place in 2009 was a big motivating factor. Bell said: 'It's been at the back of my mind for some time that I got dropped the last time I was here for a Test series. So I wanted to make this one count and it was very satisfying to do so. I deserved to be dropped at the time and I did a lot of hard yards to get back in.' Ian Bell scored 143 on the first day of the first Test against West Indies in Antigua on Monday. The 33-year-old kisses the England badge on his helmet after his 22nd Test match century. And Bell rates his hundred one of the best of his 22 \u2013 only Alastair Cook (25), out for another low score, and Kevin Pietersen (23) have scored more. Bell shared century partnerships of 177 with Joe Root, who made 83 and another one of 130 with Ben Stokes who is 71 not out. 'It has to be right up there,' said Bell . It doesn't get much better. The partnership with Joe Root was just what we needed. But the West Indies bowled very well for the first two hours. And Ben Stokes made it a brilliant finish to the day.' Bell was dropped from the side on his last visit to the Caribbean in 2009. Bell put on 177 for the fourth wicket with Joe Root and added 130 for the fifth wicket with Ben Stokes. ' It was my day today, but hopefully it will be someone else's day in the next innings. 'For me, it was nice - coming here in 2009, this was where I got dropped after our shemozzle in Jamaica, so I was determined to come out and play as well as I could. 'It was nice to come back and put things right.' Bell raises his bat after being dismissed for 143 in the evening session on day one in Antigua. Kemar Roach runs away to celebrate bowling Alastair Cook out for 11 on the first morning of the Test. Cook, who hasn't added to his record haul of 25 centuries since May 2013, was bowled by Kemar Roach for 11 falling again to a good length ball outside off stump. Roach said: 'Cook has a weakness there, everyone knows it. We let them get away a bit, but Bell batted very well.'

{"document":"Mindy Kaling has denied knowing anything about her brother's controversial choice to reveal he pretended to be an African American to get into medical school. A representative for the comedienne told US Weekly she has been estranged from Vijay Chokal-Ingam 'for years' and claimed she 'was not aware of his decision to apply to medical school under a different name and race.' This comes as Chokal-Ingam, 38, admitted his sister has told him she is 'ashamed' of him for opening up about his alleged experience ahead of the release of his new book, Almost Black, in which he will describe how he gained admission to medical school in 1998 by transforming his appearance. Denial: Mindy Kaling has said she was not aware her brother pretended to be black when he applied to medical school in the late 1990s. 'My sister Mindy Kaling (Vera Mindy Chokalingam), of the Mindy Project and Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, strongly disapproves of my book,' he wrote. 'She actually said, 'This book will bring shame on our family'. The rest of my family does not agree with the book. Still, they respect my right to make my own decisions with my career,' he added. Chokal-Ingam says on his blog that he felt he had to change his appearance to get into the St. Louis University School of Medicine and heavily attacks affirmative action policies in the United States. 'I was determined to become a doctor and I knew that admission standards for certain minorities under affirmative action were, let's say\u2026 less stringent?' wrote Chokal-Ingam. 'I got into medical school because I said I was black. The funny thing is I'm not.' He claims in 1998 he shaved his head, trimmed his 'long Indian eyelashes' and joined the Organization of Black Students during the process. Controversial claims: On his website, AlmostBlack.com, Chokal-Ingam shows side-by-side qualifications and pictures of himself as an Indian-American man (left) and a black man (right). He doesn't specify if he went through the same application process as an Indian-American man as he did as a black man. His change in appearance was 'so startling that my own fraternity brothers didn't recognize me'. 'Vijay the Indian-American frat boy became Jojo the African American Affirmative Action applicant to medical school,' he said, claiming that Jojo was the middle name he was born with. As an Indian-American with a GPA of 3.1, MCAT of 31 and a member of the South Asian Student Association, he didn't think he'd get into medical school, but with a change of appearance and switch of student organization, he thought he could get into some of the top schools in the nation. 'I became a serious contender at some of the greatest medical schools in America, including Harvard, Wash U, UPenn, Case Western, and Columbia,' he said about the application process. 'In all, I interviewed at eleven prestigious medical schools in 9 major cities across America, while posing a black man,' he added. Despite his startling claims, Chokal-Ingam fails to mention if he applied to the same schools at the same time as an Indian-American man. He also does not seem to appear repentant about presumably taking a place at college that would otherwise could have gone to another person. When he was finally accepted to St. Louis University School of Medicine, he used the acceptance to claim he was only granted admission because he was black and used the situation as an example of what was 'wrong' with affirmative action. Indeed, Chokal-Ingam admits that he did not even complete his medical degree and dropped out before he qualified as a doctor. Chokal-Ingam also admits he found posing as a black person to be socially fascinating. Success: Mindy Kaling (pictured left in August 2014 in LA and right in April 2014 in New York) is the star of her own sitcom The Mindy Project. 'Not everything worked out as planned,' he wrote on his website. 'Cops harassed me. Store clerks accused me of shoplifting. Women were either scared of me or couldn't keep their hands off me. What started as a devious ploy to gain admission to medical school turned into a twisted social experiment.' And unsurprisingly, Chokal-Ingam has been at the end of a huge backlash following his contentious claims. The Daily Beast claims that though his experience 'revealed inherent cultural bigotries that feed systematic racism', Chokal-Ingam didn't bring everything he could to the table. 'He chooses to sidestep, downplay, or flat-out ignore how the same racism that led to him being harassed by cops and store clerks keeps black applicants on the fringes of elite educational institutions for generations,' Stereo Williams wrote. 'It's easier for him to tap dance for the right wing as the brown man who 'gets it', while conveniently missing how ongoing racism makes affirmative action absolutely necessary,' he added. And though he claims he became a serious contender at schools across the nation as a black man, he doesn't specify if he went through the application process as an American-Indian man. 'Chokal-Ingam seems to have assumed that he would've gotten nowhere as an Indian American applicant and dove head first into this poorly-conceived 'experiment' before determining otherwise,' Williams wrote. And more so, Williams claims that Chokal-Ingam's experiment 'is insulting to what black people endure in this country, both institutionally and culturally'. Williams claims: 'And as a person of color, it's irresponsible for him to be so invested in the idea of individual exceptionalism that he ignores structural inadequacies. 'Black people can't be as 'racist' as whites societally, Mr. Chokal-Ingam. You didn't spend your time applying to black colleges in the hopes of finding work as a doctor in black-owned and operated hospitals. 'And a major reason why you were in a position to be considered for entry into any white institution is because black people generations before you made that possible through sacrifice and hard work. 'The attempt to undermine their work for the sake of promoting false 'equality' is truly regrettable. But when you conduct social 'experiments' that cite C. Thomas Howell's Soul Man as an inspiration, it's obvious that you don't take these issues all that seriously.'\n","right_summary":"Comedienne Mindy Kaling, 35, says she did not know about her brother's decision to apply to medical school posing as an African American.

{"document":"When Bruce Jenner told ABC's Diane Sawyer and the world on Friday night that \"Yes, for all intents and purposes, I'm a woman,\" the declaration wasn't particularly surprising. Paparazzi have been stalking the former Olympic champion for months, breathlessly documenting his increasingly feminine appearance down to his lip gloss, pierced ears and French manicure. The social media reaction?  A cheer, a shrug -- and not much else. Except the occasional prod at Jenner also being Republican. Of course, Jenner's family owned the moment, being the reality TV mavens they are -- the Jenners and the Kardashians. \"So very proud of you, my hero,\" tweeted daughter Kendall Jenner. His other daughter Kylie Jenner expressed mixed emotions. \"Understandingly, this has been very hard for me. You will hear what I have to say when I'm ready to but ... this isn't about me. I'm so proud of you, Dad. You are so brave. My beautiful Hero,\" she said on Twitter. Ex-wife Kris Jenner was equally supportive. \"Not only was I able to call him my husband for 25 years and father of my children, I am now able to call him my hero,\" she said. Stepdaughters Kim, Khlo\u00e9 and Kourtney Kardashian also joined the family chorus. \"Love is the courage to live the truest, best version of yourself. Bruce is love. I love you Bruce. #ProudDaughter,\" Kim tweeted. \"Just finished watching the #BruceJennerInterview with the family. Bruzer, I'm soooo proud of you! Dads really are heros \u2764\ufe0f,\" Khlo\u00e9 said on Twitter. \"Couldn't be a more proud daughter. With courage and bravery, let's change the world. I am honored to stand by Bruce's side and support him,\" Kourtney said. The entertainment industry was quick to embrace the news. Lady Gaga has long supported lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues. \"We have the chance to write this moment in history together,\" she tweeted.  \"Let's empower people like Bruce all over the world by being loving & not mean.\ud83d\udc97\" Transgender actress Laverne Cox of \"Orange is the New Black\" gave a shout out. \"Sending lots of love and support to #BruceJenner and their family tonight,\" she tweeted.  \"It is always brave to stand in one's truth. Congrats darling.\" The Jenner interview was a key moment for advocacy groups like GLAAD and  the National Center for Transgender Equality, thrusting LGBT issues into the spotlight. \"Today, millions of people learned that someone they know is transgender,\" GLAAD tweeted. \"Welcome, #BruceJenner,\" Trans Equality tweeted.  \"Thank you for your courage and bravery.\" As with all things, public opinion is hardly unanimous and social media only represents the views of those who post. Still, there were few detractors. One man used an Old Testament Bible verse as the basis for his stance. \"GOP Logic: Bruce Jenner is not Gay...but Transgender,\" Benny said on Twitter.  \"Still forbidden by the Bible but we cherrypick.\" This woman wasn't sure what to make of Jenner's announcement. \"Still confused about Bruce Jenner becoming a woman...,\" tweeted HugHey. And what would a social media event be without a good dose of humor. Many folks seemed to be more intrigued by Jenner's announcement that he's Republican than him coming out as a woman. \"I accept that Bruce Jenner is a Republican and wish him happiness, even if I can't understand it,\" said Johnny McNulty. \"I'll accept Bruce Jenner's choice to live how he wants much easier than leftists will accept his politics,\" CounterMoonbat said on twitter. And this final nugget from Bibi. \"Bruce Jenner: *comes out as a woman*. \"Everyone: \"Yas girl, slay\" \"Bruce Jenner: *comes out as a republican*.

{"document":"Western Australia (CNN)Many Australians are understandably appalled by the brutal and pointless executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. The death penalty looks anachronistic and ineffective at the best of times, but to kill two people who had clearly made the most of their long periods of incarceration to transform themselves and make amends for their actions looks gratuitous and cruel. Consequently, Indonesia's actions raise more general questions about the powers we give to states -- or, more accurately, to those who control the coercive apparatus of the state at any particular moment. As German sociologist Max Weber pointed out, one of the key features of an effective state is that it has a monopoly over the legitimate use of violence. State officials can order people to be killed because -- especially in democracies -- we authorize them to do so. We can give no more significant power to another human being than to decide who lives or who dies. And yet even where that authority is deemed legitimate -- as is clearly the case in Indonesia -- its significance is only seriously considered at moments like this, when the very personal circumstances of some of its victims become the stuff of popular commentary and media interest. Less prominent victims of state-sanctioned violence often go entirely unremarked. However disappointed we may be in the actions of Indonesian President Joko Widodo -- in whom so many inside and outside Indonesia have invested such hopes as a progressive force -- he can make a couple of claims in his defense. First, Widodo -- popularly known as Jokowi -- is Indonesia's elected leader and is fulfilling his promise to crack down on what he and many other Indonesians see as a problem. Indonesia's domestic political context and the need to be seen as not giving favorable treatment to foreigners left him very little room to maneuver. This is not a justification for his actions, but it helps to explain why he was so impervious to pleas for mercy. Whatever we may think about the underlying principles and administration of justice in Indonesia, at least Jokowi can claim that it is essentially a domestic issue. We may not like Indonesia's laws, but they are being applied even-handedly within national borders where state officials have authority. Significantly, it is those same national borders that demarcate the extent of Indonesia's leaders ability -- or even desire, perhaps -- to use their capacity for state-sanctioned violence. Other countries -- including Australia -- have no such inhibitions and regularly kill perfectly innocent civilians in the course of one conflict or another. This propensity for the application of state-sanctioned violence seems especially germane when we consider another president about whom great things were expected, but who has inevitably disappointed. After the unilateralism of George W. Bush, Barack Obama was widely predicted to be a very different sort of president and one who would not make the sort of catastrophic strategic miscalculations of his predecessor. Paradoxically enough, though, while Obama has been widely criticized for a lack of decisiveness and unwillingness to commit more American forces to the Middle East, this has done nothing to curb the use of state-sanctioned violence. On the contrary, the use of drone strikes has become a key part of America's continuing war on terror. It is unsurprising, perhaps, that a cerebral and reflective leader as Obama is should be attracted to drones as a weapon of choice. Unlike Jokowi, Obama doesn't have to confront the personal narratives of the people who die at his command. Or he doesn't unless they're American citizens, at least. The recent death of an American hostage during a recent drone strike highlights the potential for \"collateral damage\". Are these cases comparable? Yes and no. Widodo's executions were cold-blooded, unnecessary and highly political. Obama clearly was not intending to kill Americans, and this has only become an issue because one of the hostages actually was. However, dozens of entirely innocent women and children from other countries are routinely killed in such strikes with little comment. The key point is that we are collectively responsible for such deaths at some level or another, especially if our leaders and state officials carry them out. Do good intentions justify one death and not another? Perhaps. Would we encourage the state to kill a thousand innocents if it meant eliminating Hitler? Almost certainly. Would we authorize a drone strike to kill ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdad if we thought a couple of passers-by might die, too? Perhaps. Would we permit the state to execute people? Not any longer in Australia, at least. But before we congratulate ourselves on how civilized and humane we've become, perhaps we should pause to consider the violence that is still being inflicted on perfectly innocent people around the world in our collective name. What was done in the name of the Indonesian state was undoubtedly awful, futile and reprehensible. Whether our moral calculus is quite so self-evidently superior is not quite so clear.

The guest noted they heard five shots, followed by a pause, which was followed by three more shots before hearing silence. They also stated they had seen a hole in the glass on the outside of the building, which Schock said he went to investigate. 'I seen a two-inch opening through the glass pane,' said Schock. 'At that time I immediately called 911.' Investigation: Police believe 35-year-old Donnell Graham shot wife Shaquana Graham, 33, and another man before fatally shooting himself in the head.

{"document":"Most people give up chocolate for Lent but one businesswoman decided to use her 40 days to change the lives of others - after almost losing her own. Triathlete Charlotte Roach, 26, from London, who nearly died in a horror crash, gave up ordinary clothes for Lent to raise money for the charity that saved her life. Along with her business partner Rosemary Pringle, 28, the pair vowed to sport only fancy dress costumes for 40 days to fundraise for London's Air Ambulance. Charlotte Roach and her business partner\u00a0Rosemary Pringle dressed up in different costumes for every day of lent to raise money for the Air Ambulance Service which saved Charlotte after she was involved in car accident in 2010. The two women rated buskers in London's Trafalgar Square while dressed as Simon Cowell, rode the Tube as Baywatch lifeguards and even pitched to clients in their pyjamas. Charlotte, co-founder of fitness company Rabble, owes the charity her life after a crash in November 2010 left her with punctured lungs, 12 fractured vertebrae, broken ribs and a broken collarbone. The fitness fanatic had been out cycling near Melton in Leicestershire in a bid to make the 2012 Olympic triathlete team when her bike collided with a Land Rover. She said: 'When I went down, nobody on my team saw it, so they just assumed I'd taken a tumble and I'd be fine in a minute or two. 'Luckily, the car behind us was driven by a physio for Leicester Tigers' rugby team and she took a look at me. Charlotte continued: 'She could hear a gurgling sound when I spoke, which was the sound of blood seeping into my lungs. Charlotte and Rosemary dressed up as Simon Cowell one day and rated performers in Leicester Square. The two women larked about dressed as Reindeer in some shrubbery. 'Effectively, I was drowning and I was running out of time to live. Her quick thinking probably saved my life.' Charlotte was airlifted to Royal Derby Hospital, where medics battled to pull her back from the brink of death. She underwent emergency spinal surgery and extensive reconstructive work. Doctors warned she may never walk again, but determined Charlotte worked hard at her rehabilitation. She said: 'In my head I thought as soon as I got home, it would all be okay, but when I got home I couldn't really move. 'I still had holes in my chest that needed to be re-dressed and repacked by doctors every day. Charlotte (left) and Rosemary (right) wore a series of different costumes, here Rosemary is dressed as Harry Potter. Charlotte said that the pair had a lot of different reactions, from laughter to confusion. The former triathlete said that with some of the costumes it was hard for people to tell whether they were dressed up or not. 'One day, despite my mum's protests, I decided to walk to the doctors. My neighbour had to come round to tie my shoes as I couldn't bend down. 'I started walking but had to stop after around 400m. That's when it hit home how little I could do.' Following the accident, Charlotte, who had left university to train as a triathlete full time, was dropped by her former sponsors. 'I wanted to prove I could get back to where I used to be, fitness wise,' she said. 'The less people believed in me, the more determined I became. 'I later found out that, after the accident, doctors called my parents to say I may not survive. I think I was the only person who didn't think I was going to die.' Larking about on a Boris bike Charlotte dressed up as a clown. Following her accident Charlotte was left with severe injuries and had screws put into her spine. Slowly, Charlotte began to repair herself. While easing herself back into exercise, she stumbled upon the idea for Rabble, a fitness company that disguises exercise as games like capture the flag and dodgeball. 'While I was recovering from my injuries I thought to myself: \"exercise as an adult really sucks.\" It can be repetitive, isolating and boring. 'I wanted to recreate that feeling of playing out with your mates as a kid.' It was the Rabble members that birthed the idea of the fancy dress challenge. 'We were coming up with fun ideas of what to give up for a Lent. A few were chucked around but none really stuck,' said Charlotte. For this costume Charlotte joked about as she was dressed up as a robber. The girls went about their daily lives whilst dressed in the costumes, including going to work and going to meetings. 'Somebody suggested [giving up] clothes as a joke and at first I thought: 'that's the kind of thing that gets people arrested,' but then we decided to give up normal clothes instead. 'We forget we're wearing costumes until we get weird looks. People do react quite differently. Some laugh, and some almost look disgusted. It depends on the outfit as some aren't obviously fancy dress. 'Our most embarrassing moment so far was meeting with a big, corporate bank in our pyjamas. At first, they wouldn't even let us in the building.' In August 2012, Charlotte cycled 16,000 miles from Beijing to London, raising \u00a310,000 for London's Air Ambulance. Now, she is keen to keep donating. 'I owe the Air Ambulance my life. I wouldn't have survived without them,' she said. 'At the very least I want to donate enough to save someone else life.' For this look they used toilet roll to turn themselves into mummies.\n","right_summary":"Charlotte Roach was nearly killed in a horrific car accident in 2010.

Luke Shambrook was last seen leaving Candlebark Campground in Fraser National Park, central Victoria at 9.30am on Good Friday. The 11-year old was camping in the national forest with his family, and it is understood he wandered off and has not been seen since.

Luke Shambrook was last seen on the national park at 9.30am on Good Friday. It is understood he wandered off and has not been seen since. They say the disappearance is completely out of character for him. A widespread search is being carried by search and rescue teams including the air wing, dog squad, local police and SES members, along with campers around the surrounding areas. Sergeant Greg Paul said the search was focused on an area of several kilometres of bushland. 'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush,' he told reporters on Saturday. 'We've also got people walking the banks of the lake.' But he outlined a serious hurdle for the search efforts, according to ABC. 'With the autistic condition, Luke might not respond to searchers, he may not even know that he's lost,' he said. 'He won't necessarily respond to his name being called, but that might change a little bit as he gets hungry maybe.

{"document":"The crew of a replica pirate schooner were forced to abandon ship after their vessel lost power in rough seas off the coast of Maine. Nine members of the Liana's Ransom were scooped up by Coast Guard life boats on Tuesday, leaving the Canadian charter ship adrift 30 miles east of Portland, Coast Guard officials said. The tall ship reported having issues with the engines around 12.35 a.m. on Monday, and said the sails had become wrapped around the mast. Scroll down for video. Mid-sea rescue: Coast Guard life boats facilitated a rescue of crew members from the Liana's Ransom, who had to leap from the replica schooner. Two lifeboat crews were dispatched from Gloucester, Massachusetts, to try and tow the vessel to shore, but 10-foot swells caused a tow line to break. The crew was ordered to put on immersion suits and abandon the schooner, according to a press release from the Coast Guard. In a video of the rescue, a man in a jacket successfully makes the jump from the Liana's Ransom to the lifeboat as the two ships pitch in the rough seas. CBS reports crew member Luke Arbuckle came up short while attempting to make the jump to the Coast Guard ship. 'Apparently the ship separated just as I jumped over, and I ended up in the water,' Arbuckle said. Arbuckle's forehead struck the side of the boat while jumping, and he was rescued and transported by a Coast Guard helicopter to the hospital, where he was treated and later released. Safe and sound: The crew was reportedly dehydrated and seasick after being caught in choppy weather early Monday morning. Pulled out: Crew member Luke Arbuckle shorted the jump as the two boats tilted away from each other and struck his head against the boat before being airlifted to the hospital. Ahoy: The 85-foot-long ship was on its way to St Maarten in the Caribbean with nine crew members on its first voyage of the season. The 24-year-old captain of the Liana's Ransom, Ryan Tilley, was the last crew member to depart the drifting ship, his father, Joseph Tilley, wrote on the ship's Facebook page. 'Seeing the ship crippled, damaged and left floating there as we motored away with the Coast Guard was probably one of the worst moments of my life, but you have to put lives first,' Ryan told WCVB. The boat was towed to  Kittery Point Yacht Yard in Eliot, Massachusetts, on Tuesday evening where it will be repaired. The ship's website states the vessel was on its way to St Maarten, which was to be its new home port, when it lost engine power. The schooner, which has a 70-passenger capacity, was built to resemble ships used by privateers and pirates in the 1700s and is equipped with replica black powder cannons, according to the site.\n","right_summary":"The crew of the Liana's Ransom, an 85-foot-long replica schooner, were rescued by the Coast Guard early Monday morning.

Mrs Clinton said that she wanted nobody to know when she was going to the pool apart from one usher who was to guide her there. There she would spend three and a half hours sitting on her own reading looking \u2018heartbroken\u2019, according to a new book. A new book has claimed that Hillary Clinton imposed a blanket of secrecy on her movements during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The vivid account is written by Kate Andersen Brower, a former White House correspondent for Bloomberg News in \u2018The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House.\u2019 She tells how in the summer of 1998, a few days before Mr Clinton would admit to sex with former White House intern Miss Lewinsky, usher Worthington White was approached by Mrs Clinton. She told him that she wanted to go to the pool but that only he could see her - no other aides and no Secret Service. Mr White said that he told Mrs Clinton\u2019s lead Secret Service agent: \u2018If anybody sees her, or she sees anybody, I\u2019m going to get fired, I know it. And you probably will too\u2019. By the pool Mrs Clinton would spend three and a half hours sitting on her own reading looking \u2018heartbroken, it is claimed. Mrs Clinton\u2019s wish was granted and she took an elevator to the pool, spent the afternoon there and came back the same way,. Miss Brower writes that Mrs Clinton \u2018turned to White, took his hands and squeezed them, looked him in the eye, and thanked him.\u2019 The book also recounts how the Clintons did not trust the old fashioned White House telephone system and felt too many people could listen in - so had it completely rewired. Miss Brower writes: \u2018They had all the White House phones changed over to interior circuitry so that if the first lady was in the bedroom and the president was in the study, she could ring him from room to room without going through the operator\u2019. Such upheaval did not go down well with staff and according to James W.F. \u2018Skip\u2019 Allen, an usher from 1979 to 2004, the Clintons were \u2018about the most paranoid people I\u2019d ever seen in my life\u2019. The disclosure sheds new light on the row over Mrs Clinton\u2019s use of a private email account and her own personal server whilst Secretary of State. It could harm her chances in the race for the Presidency in 2016 - she is expected to announce her candidacy this month.

{"document":"Cooking a gourmet lunch for family and friends at Easter has never been so easy - or cheap. One of Australia's most loved cooks, Lyndey Milan, has teamed up with Aldi to create Easter lunch recipes that will easily feed six people for less than $6 each. The home cook icon put her skills to the test by trawling the supermarket aisles to find healthy, fresh produce to turn into an Easter feast. Scroll down for video. One of Australia's most loved cooks, Lyndey Milan, has teamed up with Aldi to create Easter lunch recipes that will easily feed six people for less than $6 each. 'I am such of a massive fan of the hospitality of a table. I think sitting down around a table is the loveliest thing,' Milan told Daily Mail Australia. 'The worst homemade disaster is better than the shop bought stuff. You'll be wealthier, healthier and friendlier for cooking for the people you love.' The results of her Aldi experiment include Greek lamb with salad and zucchini pilaf and herb crusted salmon with pea puree, smashed potatoes and carrots. For dessert, Lyndey says her hot cross bun and Easter egg bread & butter pudding with almond praline, which came in at $2 per person, is guaranteed to be a crowd-pleaser. 'The hot cross bun pudding is so much fun.\u00a0What I like about it is you can use leftovers \u2013 you'll always have stale hot cross buns and Easter eggs,' Lyndey told Daily Mail Australia. 'The salmon is smart enough for a dinner party. I would serve that for people coming for dinner. 'What I love about it is the ease of preparation. All you do it make the crusting, spread the salmon with Dijon mustard \u2013 it's not that hard, it's perfect.' The home cook icon put her skills to the test by trawling the Aldi supermarket aisles to find healthy, fresh produce to turn into an Easter feast - including\u00a0hot cross bun and Easter egg bread & butter pudding. Greek lamb with salad and zucchini pilaf is also on Lyndey's menu for Easter. Lyndey was inspired by the lamb dish after filming a cooking series in Greece a few years back. 'At Easter, some people like to eat fish but then lamb is so traditional.\u00a0Sometimes families aren't sure of how to cook it \u2013 the whole point of Greek lamb is it's well cooked, so you don't have that issue of cooking it rare for some and well done for others,' she said. 1. Use up all of what you buy. 2. Buy fresh produce that\u2019s in season. 3. Store things correctly so they will keep well in your fridge. 4. Take advantage of any deals or specials and build your weekly meals around them. 5. Always try to use leftovers in another meal. 6. Only buy what you need. 7. Use your freezer. 'You can buy it from Aldi already butterflied so you can reduce cooking time.\u00a0I just did that really simple zucchini pilaf, but you can use any sort of veggie. 'With a recipe, it's only a description of what you've done once\u2026 I love it when people change them and make it their own.' Lyndey had never stepped foot inside an Aldi before she partnered with them to create the Easter recipes. 'I did my personal research on Aldi, I went and visited two stores. I was waiting to get arrested by the store detective,' Lyndey said. 'I went around taking photos and making notes of the prices, which I couldn't believe by the way.\u00a0I then went and bought all my ingredients... I did a spreadsheet of costs and then created. 'All of their meat is grass-fed, they have Australian cheese in there that's won Sydney Royal Medals \u2013 I just saw how much of their stuff is Australian. 'I'm now a convert.' Lyndey says her hot cross bun and Easter egg bread & butter pudding with almond praline, which came in at $2 per person, is guaranteed to be a crowd-pleaser. Lyndey says her\u00a0herb crusted salmon with pea puree, smashed potatoes and carrots is quick and easy to prepare. Lyndey, who prides herself on never throwing food out, says there's a few simple tips to keep the grocery spend down and minimise waste. 1. Use up all of what you buy. Cooking a whole chicken? Boil up the bones with a carrot, onion, parsley stalks and peppercorns and make your own stock or soup base. Do the same with meat bones. 2. Buy fresh produce that\u2019s in season. Not only does it taste better, it costs less. 3. Store things correctly so they will keep well in your fridge. Soak celery in icy cold water, drain, then wrap well in plastic in the fridge. Store herbs and shallots in damp kitchen paper inside a plastic bag to keep them fresh. Store potatoes and onions in a cool, dark place. 4. Take advantage of any deals or specials and build your weekly meals around them. ALDI has 7 Day Deals each Wednesday, which include amazing specials on meat, produce and some different and exciting products in the fridge. 5. Always try to use leftovers in another meal. Cold roast meat and vegetables can liven up a bland salad. Leftover vegies can go into a pasta, soup, frittata or risotto. Banana muffins or ice-cream can be made using over-ripe bananas and almost anything can be turned into a curry. 6. Only buy what you need. Always check the fridge and pantry before you shop and make a list before you go in store. 7. Use your freezer. Liquids like wine, coconut milk and stock can be frozen to use when needed. Bread stores well in the freezer and once defrosted, makes an excellent savoury breadcrumb topping with grated cheese. Herb Crusted Salmon with Pea Puree:. 6 salmon fillets (140g each) \u00a0\u00a03 tbsp. (1\/4 cup) Dijon mustard. 25g (1\/2 packet) fresh parsley \u00a0\u00a025g (1\/2 packet) fresh dill. \u00bd cup dried bread crumbs \u00a0\u00a0Olive oil. 30g butter \u00a0\u00a03 green onions (shallots), finely chopped. 2 sprigs mint \u00a0\u00a0500g frozen peas \u00a0\u00a01 tbsp. lemon juice (optional) METHOD:. Pre-heat oven to 180\u2070C [160\u2070C fan-forced] and line a baking tray with baking paper. Place salmon on the prepared baking tray. Spread with mustard and season with salt and pepper. Chop parsley and dill in a small processor, then add breadcrumbs and enough olive oil to moisten. Press down on salmon. Roast for 8 minutes for pink or 12 minutes for well done. Serve salmon on pea puree (recipe below), with smashed potatoes and ginger carrots. Melt butter in a medium saucepan, add green onions and stir over medium heat until softened.

{"document":"It has been 40 years since the historic evacuation of the of Saigon as the North Vietnamese army descended upon the city, and among the many stories of heroism and bravery is that of a father who piloted a military helicopter to fly his family to safety. Ba Van Nguyen was able to fly a CH-47 Chinook, the largest helicopter in the South Vietnamese army, with his three young children and wife out of the city and into the South China Sea where they were all ultimately saved by the USS Kirk. This after Nguyen somehow managed to pilot the helicopter while getting out of his flight suit and jumping into the ocean just seconds before it crashed - all on his own. Scroll down for videos. Histo4ric:\u00a0Ba Van Nguyen piloted a military helicopter (above) on his own to save his family during the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975. Saved: He flew towards the USS Kirk which was too small to allow the helicopter to land, and so he hoovered over as his family (daughter circled in red) safely jumped out. Helping hand: Sailors on the ship caught the family (above) as they jumped out. In an interview with CNN, some members of the family are revealing what happened on that historic day, and their lives in the years after. They were also part of the PBS special, The Last Days of Vietnam. On April 29, 1975, Nguyen moved his family to his mother-in-law's house, telling them he would be back the next day in the Chinook, and that they would hear him coming when he was close. 'If you hear a Chinook coming, get ready,' Nguyen told his wife. When he arrived later that morning, his family and a few friends got on - as gunfire from the communist forces grew louder and louder as they came closer to the city - and flew out towards the water. Shortly after however, they realized they were running low on fuel, and that is when Nguyen reached out to the Kirk asking for permission to land. 'I must land or crash into the sea,' Nguyen said. 'Please help us.' Bravery: Nguyen then flew back out to sea (above) and jumped from the helicopter. Safe: He managed to avoid the large amounts of shrapnel (above) when the plan crashed. Heading back: A motorboat soon grabbed him from the sea (above) as he wore just a shirt and his boxers. The Kirk however was not large enough to withstand the force of such a large helicopter, which would likely sink the ship and cause the death of everyone onboard. And so it was decided that Nguyen would at least try and save his family. He hoovered over the ship as every passenger jumped onto the deck and were caught by sailors, including his wife and three young children. That is when he went back out to sea and managed to do the impossible and somehow pilot alone, get out of his suit and jump into the water seconds before the helicopter crashed and sent shrapnel flying everywhere. Seconds later, he appeared in the water, wearing nothing but his boxer shorts and a shirt. Hos one possession, some gold he had in his pocket, had fell out and sunk in the South China Sea. 'We couldn't figure out how he did it; he was a Houdini,' said Hugh Doyle, the chief engineering officer. A motorboat was sent out to retrieve him, and moments later he was reunited with his family. The Nguyen family would be part of the 30,000 South Vietnamese refugees ultimately rescued by the Kirk. 'It was a happy ending to a shi**y war,' said\u00a0Kent Chipman, one of the sailors on the Kirk. Unbelievable: Nguyen somehow managed to operate the plane and it's intricate system (above) alone after everyone jumped. Over: 'It was a happy ending to a shi**y war,' said Kent Chipman, one of the sailors on the Kirk of Nguyen's (above) feat. That was just the beginning for Nguyen though, who now had to start over in America and try to support his family. He did not know the language and he had no money, but he was able to eventually land a job as a technician at Boeing in Seattle. According to his children he was strict, but also self-sufficient and proud, getting the family off government assistance after just a few months and encouraging hard work above all else. 'Your mother and I came to the United States with nothing but my drawers,' he would tell his children. 'Look at where we are today. We are not wealthy. But we are not poor.' He was reunited with the crew from the USS Kirk in 2009, finally revealing his identity after keeping it secret for years, and awarded an air medal for bravery. 'He was staring at me and I was staring at him. He knew and I just knew,' said Chipman of the emotional reunion, this despite the fact that Nguyen was already in the throes of Alzheimer's. It was then that his children were able to see just what their father had accomplished as footage of the day was shared by some of the men who had filmed the incident. Then, three years later, following a remarkable life, Nguyen passed away. He was 73-years-old.\n","right_summary":"Ba Van Nguyen piloted a military helicopter on his own to save his family during the fall of Saigon on April 29, 1975.

{"document":"Celtic are considering a second double raid on Dundee United for teenager John Souttar and striker Nadir Ciftci. The Tannadice club sparked a row with supporters when they sold star duo Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven to the Parkhead club on deadline day in January. Jackie McNamara\u2019s side have won just three of their 14 games since, and lost 3-0 at home to Ronny Deila\u2019s side on Sunday. Dundee United midfielder John Souttar (right) challenges for possession with Celtic's Kris Commons. Heavily linked with Ciftci in January, the Norwegian has also earmarked 18-year-old Souttar as potential cover for Scott Brown and Nir Bitton in a holding midfield role. The teenager has recently impressed in the middle of the pitch since switching from central defence. Ciftci and Souttar are under contract until May next year and could go for a combined fee of \u00a31.5million. Admitting there is huge pressure on the Europa League contenders not to sell any more players to Celtic, however, United No 2 Simon Donnelly said: \u2018I think that\u2019s always going to be there. All the drama that was whipped up over the stuff in January wasn\u2019t helpful to the club, but we as coaches and the manager just have to try and focus on our job here. You are always going to have interest and speculation. We\u2019ve had to deal with it for the two years we\u2019ve been here.\u2019 Adding to the pressure on United was the public release of a clause in manager McNamara\u2019s contract entitling him to a cut of any transfer profits. Celtic are also interested in signing striker\u00a0Nadir Ciftc from Dundee United. Insisting Tannadice minds are focused on securing a European slot next season, Donnelly played down talk of a move for Ciftci or anyone else, adding: \u2018Nadir is a Dundee United player, so it\u2019s our job in the next five games to go and try to reach Europe and Nadir will help us do that.\u2019 Meanwhile, referee Steven McLean will be back in the firing line this weekend for the first time since he and his officials missed a crucial hand-ball by Caley Thistle defender Josh Meekings in Celtic\u2019s Scottish Cup semi final defeat to Inverness at Hampden on April 19. The duo are likely to cost Celtic around \u00a31.5million, the second double raid on the club after signing Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven. Celtic, who had been leading 1-0 at the time, went on to lose 3-2 and subsequently wrote to the SFA demanding an explanation. Meekings was hit with a notice of complaint by SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan, which could have seen him miss the final, but Inverness were successful in contesting the charge. As a result of the fall-out, McLean was spared a top-flight assignment last week, serving as fourth official in Motherwell\u2019s trip to Hamilton, but will be back in the middle on Saturday for the bottom-six clash between Kilmarnock and Accies at Rugby Park.\n","right_summary":"Celtic considering bids for Dundee United's John Souttar and\u00a0Nadir Ciftci.

{"document":"A South African university is celebrating the removal of a British colonialist's statue after weeks of protests. University of Cape Town students took to social media  to demand Cecil Rhodes' statue come down, saying his legacy is tainted with racism. Using the hashtag #RhodesMustFall, students expressed their views in a campaign that started last month. Four weeks later, the hashtag is now #RhodesHas Fallen. The university said Wednesday the heritage authority granted it permission to remove the statue from the campus. \"These steps are being taken to ensure the safety of the statue while matters concerning its future are resolved,\" the university said in a statement. Rhodes' statue was first unveiled in 1934 at the university, which also has a scholarship and memorial in his name. #RhodesMustFall gained attention after activists threw excrement on the statue in March. \"He represents the former colonial representation of this country -- supremacy, racism, misogyny,\" says Ramabina Mahapa, president of the students' Representative Council, which led the fight to remove the statue. \"Students are saying these aren't the ideals that we want to have here,\" Mahapa says. \"The statue represents what is wrong with society.\" But in Pretoria, another group of protesters disagreed. \"This isn't confronting history, this is erasing it,\" says Steve Hofmeyr, a singer who participated in a campaign Thursday that involved activists chaining themselves to the Paul Kruger statue in response to #RhodesHasFallen. Days earlier,  Kruger's statue was pelted with green paint. The Afrikaner is known for his opposition to the British. Afrikaner groups also chained themselves to the statue of Dutch colonizer Jan van Riebeeck in Cape Town. \"I don't want fewer monuments,\" Hofmeyr says. \"I want more monuments erected. But don't defile the ones that exist -- we are the sum total of all the history, not just the fun parts.\" Mahapa said removing a statue shouldn't be equated with removing history. \"People down the years will be looking at the statue and at his history and what he did,\" Mahapa says. \"We need to be moving toward becoming an Afrocentric university where African thought can be appreciated.\" Hofmeyr said the statue is a race issue. \"There are huge gaping differences between people in South Africa and that is why you need dialogue, which you can't have without its monuments and statues,\" he says. Students marked the removal of Rhodes' statue with a celebratory march. They held signs that said \"we're not done yet.\" With the statue removed, some asked what's next for the movement.\n","right_summary":"Cape Town students demand Cecil Rhodes' statue come down.

{"document":"The mass stranding of 160 melon-headed whales on two beaches in Japan has triggered fears of upcoming earthquake and tsunami. The whales, which are in fact a species of dolphin, were found washed up along a 6-mile (10km) stretch of the Pacific coast of Hokato, around 60 miles (100km) north of Tokyo. Although officials are still investigating the cause of the strandings, they triggered rumours on social media of an impending earthquake. Scroll down for video. More than 160 melon-headed whales washed onto two beaches at Hokota city, north-east of Tokyo. The fears appeared to be based on the appearance of 50 melon-headed whales six days before the devastating undersea earthquake in 2011 that caused a tsunami and left 19,000 people dead. However, experts have dismissed the claims as being 'unscientific'. For centuries there have been accounts of animals behaving bizarrely before earthquakes. Now scientists have filmed the behaviour of wild animals prior to a quake and believe their study could help improve short-term seismic forecasting. They found that animals in Peru - such as pumas and razor-billed curassow birds - ran for cover days before the event. Researchers believe that the changes in behaviour may be linked to airborne ions. Led by Dr Rachel Grant of Anglia Ruskin University, experts used data gathered from a series of motion-triggered cameras located in the Yanachaga National Park in Peru. The research found that significant changes in animal behaviour began 23 days before the magnitude 7.0 Contamana earthquake that struck the region in 2011. On a typical day, the cameras would record between five and 15 animal sightings. However, within the two-day period in the run-up to the earthquake, they recorded five or fewer sightings. Instead they believe the melon-headed whales may have suffered a parasitic infection. Others believe the sandy shoals around Hokato city may have also made the animal's sonar ineffective. Toshiaki Kishiro, head of Cetacean Resources at Japan's National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries, said while it was possible the whales frightened by disturbances in the Earth's electromagnetic field caused by movement in the tectonic plates - there were was no firm evidence of this. Speaking to the Telegraph he said: 'This area of Japan has had many similar cases of beachings in the past, and especially of this species, so we are trying to find out why it happens.' He added that the animals, which measure two to three metres in length, could have been trying to avoid predators like killer whales and come too close to the shore. However, despite attempts to reassure the public, social media sites like Twitter have been ablaze with rumours of an impending earthquake. One Twitter user wrote: 'Is the next one coming? Be ready for a quake.' The whales first began to appear on the beach last week but officials said they had discovered eight more bodies today. Local residents had rushed to the beaches with buckets and towels in an attempt to help keep the marine mammals alive. Scientists are still investigating what caused the whales to become stranded on the beaches of Hokota city. Local resident used buckets of water in an attempt to keep the melon-headed whales alive on the beaches. Officials have spent the weekend removing and buring the dead melon-headed whales after they stranded. However, almost all of the animals have now died although a few were returned to the ocean. The strandings in 2011 before the magnitude 9 earthquake off the coast of Japan is not the first association of whale strandings with tectonic activity. Around 100 pilot whales died in a mass stranding on a remote beach in New Zealand just two days before a large earthquake hit Christchurch in 2011. The 2004 Boxing Day earthquake in the Indian Ocean that also triggered a devastating tsunami also saw 170 whales stranded on beaches in Australia and New Zealand in the days before. Those whales that survived were taken back out to sea by the Japan Coast Guard to return them to the ocean. Japan Coast Guard personnel managed to return some of the whales back to the sea. The whales were stranded on two beaches close to Hokota city around 60 miles north of Tokyo. According to the US Geological Survey, which monitors tremors around the world, there was a small magnitude 5.3 earthquake 157 miles (252km) off the coast of Namie, Japan. Quakes of this size are relatively common along the fault line. However, researchers have found it is possible detect tiny pulses in the Earth's magnetic field in the areas around the epicentre of earthquakes in the weeks before they occur. Researchers at San Jose State University have been developing new techniques to use these pulses to predict earthquakes using highly sensitive magnetometres. However, it is not know if whales have the ability to detect such tiny fluctuations. Tadasu Yamada, a senior researcher at the National Museum of Nature and Science, said investigations were still ongoing into what caused the whales to strand in Hokato. He told public broadcaster NHK: 'We don't see any immediate signs of diseases on their bodies, such as cancer. 'We want to figure out what killed these animals.' Residents struggled to return the whales to the sea after the mammals became exhausted in the shallow water. Once stranded, the animals are vulnerable to dehydration and sunburn until rescuers can use the high tide to move their massive weight back into deeper water. Efforts to save the dolphins stood in marked contrast to the global view of Japan and its relationship with cetaceans. Despite international opprobrium, Japan hunts minke and pilot whales off its coast, and has for many years also pursued the mammals in the Antarctic Ocean, where it takes advantage of a scientific exemption to an international moratorium on whaling. It has never made a secret of the fact that meat from the animals is consumed. A United Nations court ruled last year that the Antarctic hunt was a commercial venture masquerading as research, prompting Tokyo to suspend operations, but it vowed to redesign the programme to make it more scientific. The International Whaling Commission's (IWC) panel of experts said today that it opposed Japan's proposal for its scientific research whaling programme, saying it did not demonstrate a need for killing whales.\n","right_summary":"The whales washed up along a 6 mile stretch of coast near Hokato, Japan.

{"document":"Nico Rosberg fears the threat from Ferrari in this weekend's Bahrain Grand Prix, describing their pace as 'dangerous' and 'worrying'. Following Friday practice, in particular the evening session under the lights at the Bahrain International Circuit, Mercedes appeared comfortable. Rosberg topped the timesheet with a lap of one minute 34.647secs, finishing 0.115secs quicker than team-mate Lewis Hamilton after the reigning champion locked up in the second sector, costing him four tenths of a second. Nico Rosberg has admitted he's wary of the threat rivals Ferrari pose ahead of Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. The Mercedes driver was complimentary of Ferrari and described their pace as 'dangerous' and 'worrying' Ferrari duo Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel finished third and fourth quickest, just over half a second adrift of Rosberg. Yet the 29-year-old German, who trails Hamilton by 17 points in the drivers' standings, is deeply concerned by Ferrari from what he witnessed over the course of the two 90-minute sessions. 'We are very quick on one lap again, and Ferrari are very dangerous on the long run,' said Rosberg. 'They have serious pace, which is very worrying. It looks like they are a genuine threat. 'In qualifying we are much quicker, but in the race they are quick. 'Tyre wise, it is pretty straightforward, with both tyres (the soft and medium-compound Pirellis) quite robust. It is just the absolute pace which is important.' Rosberg (left) trails team-mate Lewis Hamilton by 17 points in the drivers' standings ahead of Sunday's race. Barring mistakes it appears another Mercedes front-row lock-out is likely, with the Ferrari's occupying the second row, and from there a battle with strategy and pace. Hamilton has also expressed concerns about Ferrari as he said: 'They are going to be very close. They look very good, from what I can see, in the long run. 'The crucial part is we know we have speed in a qualifying lap, so it's more the speed on the race runs. 'That's an area we're really trying to work on, but other than that the car has been feeling very good, I'm really happy with it.' But the 29-year-old topped the timesheet with a lap of one minute 34.647secs during Friday practice. Vettel, 13 points adrift of Hamilton, endured a disruptive day as a loss of power compromised FP1, whilst a collision with Sergio Perez in his Force India hampered FP2. McLaren's Jenson Button also suffered a wretched day with technical issues in both sessions, resulting in a lack of running that left him down in 19th position, 4.5 seconds behind Rosberg and sandwiched between Manor duo Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi. Saturday could be problematic for all, though, as a sandstorm has been forecast to hit the area at some point during the day.\n","right_summary":"Nico Rosberg described Ferrari's pace as 'dangerous' and 'worrying' The Mercedes driver is preparing for Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix.

{"document":"Most parents have the souvenir of a scan of their child in the womb at 12 weeks. The must-have for IVF mums and dads these days, however, is a video and pictures right from the moment of conception. The images are thanks to revolutionary technology that allows medics to record the microscopic miracle of life \u2013 from fertilisation to the division of cells, right through to the growth of an embryo. Hundreds of parents are now the proud owners of these EmbryoScope images, which are also helping scientists learn more about the IVF process. Scroll down for video. Pictured is the very first cell division of Pixie Morley, now aged nine months, taken using the revolutionary EmbryoScope technology. Sally and Stephen Morley (pictured with their daughter Pixie) are one of some 1,500 couples in Britain who have had babies using EmbryoScope technology. Sally and Stephen Morley are among them. The grainy grey and white picture on this page shows the first cell division in the creation of their IVF baby, Pixie. A tiny camera, placed inside an incubator, films the reproduction process. As well as allowing parents to watch back the moment the embryos form, the technology \u2013 developed in the US \u2013 also allows experts to select the best possible embryos based on how they form during the conception process. This narrows a mother\u2019s chance of miscarrying. The Morleys, from Walsall, had spent months trying to have children naturally before opting for IVF. Mrs Morley, 38, the head of a nursery, said: \u2018I knew time was against me being 36 when we started trying so when I failed to get pregnant each month I knew we should have fertility tests as soon as possible.\u2019 While the couple were undergoing IVF, the EmbryoScope technology was introduced at the Midland Fertility Clinic, allowing them to be the first in their area to capture their child\u2019s conception on camera. The technology allows medics and parents to watch the cell dividing. Pictured is the cell division of now nine-month-old Pixie. In October 2013, the embryo was transferred into Mrs Morley\u2019s womb and within two weeks she was told by doctors that the process had been successful. Now, nine months after Pixie\u2019s birth, she is still able to re-watch the moment her daughter was conceived. Experts have hailed the technology as one of the most important developments in IVF. Professor Simon Fishel, who is boss of Care Fertility, the first clinic in Britain to use the EmbryoScope, said: \u2018We now know that embryos that do make babies and embryos that don\u2019t make babies do different things. 'And to be able to see this in a time-matched movie and to be able to analyse it scientifically is absolutely wonderful science for us.\u2019 Professor Fishel, who was part of the team that produced first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, in 1978, said the EmbryoScope was revealing the secrets about what happens to embryos as they develop \u2013 and why it is that around 70 per cent of them do not actually make babies. The videos were also an emotional milestone in the process of becoming a parent, Professor Fishel said. \u2018The couple can see the process of fertilisation, see the cells divide, see the number of cells grow and see them produce an embryo\u2026it is nothing short of observing the wonderful miracle of life.\u2019 The video given to parents is a sped-up version of the process which occurs before the embryo develops. Professor Fishel said his patients were \u2018awestruck\u2019 when given the footage but that the clinic only gave parents the video once a mother had fallen pregnant. He added that, at across the Care Fertility clinics, 1,000 couples, who had gone on to have a baby, had been given footage of their embryo\u2019s development.\n","right_summary":"New technology allows parents of IVF children to view babies' conception.

{"document":"Technology that claims to transform any smartphone into a Star Trek-style tricorder is set to be unveiled in Israel. The company behind the device says it has the potential to break down the chemical components of almost any object from a distance. The technology could help a range of industries such as food and drink, healthcare and the defence sector, the researchers claim. Scroll down for video. Technology that claims to transform any smartphone into a Star Trek-style tricorder is set to be unveiled in Israel. The company behind the device says it has the potential to break down the chemical components of almost any object from a distance. The image shows how the picture might be used. Unispectral Technologies and Tel Aviv University, who are behind the system, say it works by analysing a materials 'hyperspectral signature', which is its unique chemical fingerprint. The team have already patented the optical part of the system, which is based on existing microelectromechanical or 'MEMS' technology. 'The optical element acts as a tunable filter and the software - an image fusion library - would support this new component and extract all the relevant information from the image,' said Professor David Mendlovic at Tel Aviv University. Hyperspectral imaging collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum. A Tricorder is a scanning device used by Starfleet personnel in the Star Trek universe. It was used largely by Mr Spock, the alien first officer of the Starship Enterprise. Once the camera take an image, the data would be further analysed by a third-party to extract the hyperspectral signature at any location in the image. Hyperspectral imaging collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum. For each pixel in an image, a hyperspectral camera acquires the light intensity for a large number of different spectral bands. This allows it to provide more detailed information about the scene than a normal color camera, which only acquires three different spectral bands. The imaging works in both video and still photography, he says. 'We are close to producing a prototype, which is scheduled for release in June,' said Professor Mendlovic. 'A long list of fields stand to gain from this new technology. 'We predict hyperspectral imaging will play a major role in consumer electronics, the automotive industry, biotechnology, and homeland security.' This back-end analyser would need a large database of hyperspectral signatures at its disposal. Applications of the sensor include remote health monitoring and industrial quality control. 'Agricultural applications may also benefit because hyperspectral imaging could be used to identify properties of crops, vegetables, and other types of foods,' Mr Raz says. 'Its hyperspectral platform is also suitable for wearable devices.' A first-generation demonstration system of the camera. \u00a0Once the camera take an image, the data would be further analysed by a third-party to extract the hyperspectral signature at any location in the image. According to Professor Mendlovic, Unispectral is currently in discussions with major smartphone makers, car companies, and wearable device makers to move the technology forward. A Tricorder is a scanning device used by Starfleet personnel in the Star Trek universe. There are two variations; a regular (engineering) Tricorder and a medical Tricorder. Medical Tricorders are used to wirelessly scan a patient, either in a \u2018sick bay\u2019 on a star ship or during an away mission. The scanning tool can determine a patient\u2019s medical status, and allows doctors to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasion examination. And the company isn't the only one hoping to recreate Spock's Tricorder. Earlier this year, researchers revealed a gadget that can be used to diagnose an illness simply by holding it to the forehead. Named Scanadu Scout, the small round device is able to read a number of vital signs, including heart rate and temperature. It contains a variety of different sensors alongside a microphone on the top of the gadget that together, can read vital signs, including body temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen level, heart rate variability and pulse wave transit time (PWTT). PWTT is the time it takes for a heartbeat to reach somewhere else in a person's body and is related to blood pressure. Its makers claim the device is 99 per cent accurate in less than 10 seconds. Scanadu was finalist in the Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize, which was launched in 2013 to inspire a wireless device capable of detecting a range of diseases, including anaemia, tuberculosis and diabetes. Another device by London-based, ScanNurse, uses computer-vision techniques to analyse images taken with a camera. The scientists hope their system will make observations of the inside of the ears or throat, in the same way a doctor would, and then feed it into a computer for analysis. Other teams are using blood and urine samples to test for key markers. The tiny microfluidic devices will, they claim, work in a similar way to hospital-lab tests.\n","right_summary":"System uses combination of powerful software and 'MEMS' technology.

{"document":"Just ten games. That is all Tim Sherwood has needed to bring Aston Villa out from the morgue and into life. Rigor mortis was setting in when he took over the club, but now the muscles are being flexed. An FA Cup final awaits. There have been mistakes, notably in defeats to Stoke City and Swansea, but five glorious wins and a brand of football to excite and embolden far outweighs them. Having been appointed on Valentine\u2019s Day, Villa fans have fallen in love after only nine weeks. Here, Sportsmail looks at five reasons for Sherwood\u2019s success. Tim Sherwood has had an inspired start in charge of Aston Villa as they reached the FA Cup final. Benteke's back. Upon arrival, Sherwood recognised the area he needed to target instantly: goals.\u00a0Hardly rocket science but launching Villa\u2019s scoring figures skywards was easier said than done. Straightaway as manager he had a sit down in his office with Christian Benteke where he told the Belgian striker: \u2018Two years ago, every club in Europe wanted you.\u2019 The point being to re-inject confidence in this quiet character. Benteke is determined but responds well to arm-round-shoulder words. At the end of his reign, Paul Lambert tried stick to inspire Benteke\u2019s best, dropping him for the visit of Chelsea. Benteke understood, but was nevertheless frustrated. He felt starved of service in Lambert\u2019s safety-first style. Christian Benteke has flourished under Sherwood and has scored nine in his last seven for Villa. Sherwood addressed this immediately. During half-time in the FA Cup match against Leicester \u2013 the day before his unveiling \u2013 he entered the dressing room and told his players to get the ball to Benteke more often, and quicker. Villa scored two second half goals to progress. Benteke has now got nine in his last seven for Villa, having scored three in 18 under Lambert this season. There is variety, pace, and creativity in the final third and Villa have already surpassed under Sherwood the total goals managed with Lambert at the helm this season: 16 goals in 10 games, compared to 15 in 28. The Belgian international fires home the equaliser at Wembley as he helped Villa conquer Liverpool. Trust in youth. For around an hour after carrying out media duties on Friday, Sherwood stood to watch Villa\u2019s Under-11s squad as they trained at Bodymoor Heath. The man for whom youth development is so important was able to find time on the eve of his biggest managerial test to observe a crop of potential talents who will only be senior players many years down the line. That kind of commitment breeds belief across the training pitches. His faith in Jack Grealish is the biggest illustration of his philosophy, but he also handed Rushian Hepburn-Murphy his debut as a substitute at Aston Villa aged 16. Since Sherwood\u2019s arrival, the under-21s have been moved to train on pitches adjacent to the first-team and a number regularly join in with sessions when 11 v 11, Kevin Toner and Lewis Kinsella among them. Jack Grealish was the star man against Brendan Rodgers' side and has earned rave reviews under Sherwood. Sherwood attended the City Ground last Wednesday to witness 22-year-old Gary Gardner, on loan at Nottingham Forest from Villa, score a brilliant free-kick. The night previous he was at Rochdale v Swindon to possibly run the rule over Massimo Luongo, also 22, his under-21 captain when at Tottenham. Such an approach is with eyes on building the club over the coming months and years but short-term it has served to bring renewed energy. The former Tottenham boss is keen on youth development and watched on-loan Gary Gardner score. Delph delivering. Fabian Delph signed his new contract at Villa before Sherwood arrived \u2013 it was actually announced on the big screens at Villa Park ahead of the FA Cup clash with Bournemouth \u2013 but the 25-year-old has since been handed key responsibilities. The England midfielder, described as Villa\u2019s Hoover by Sherwood, was given the captain\u2019s armband permanently, taking over from Ron Vlaar and leapfrogging deputy Gabby Agbonlahor, based on his mentality and exuberant grit in midfield. He has led by example, turning in performances that make him a certainty for Roy Hodgson. Fabian Delph is arguably Villa's most important player and he's become a real leader under new management. Sherwood has asked for more forward movement too, and offensive involvement. Delph\u2019s ability to drive past players \u2013 exhibited for both goals at Wembley \u2013 was compared to Paul Gascoigne by Sherwood and the Bradford-born player has responded to that acclaim. He has two goals under Sherwood after not finding the net once this season for Lambert. \u2018When I came to the club Fabian Delph had just signed a new contract, he had an opportunity to go to some of the teams in the top four. He showed a lot of loyalty,\u2019 says Sherwood. \u2018I need characters like that, put themselves on the line. He can add goals to his game, he has so much energy he can get into the final third and score. He\u2019s nicked a couple for me already. I just want to encourage him to do that and then he\u2019ll be too expensive for anyone to buy.\u2019 The England international scored the winner at Wembley to send his side into the FA Cup Final in May. Sound staff moves. Sherwood acted swiftly in the backroom department too, bringing in Mark Robson as first-team coach, and Seamus Brady as performance analyst before his first official game in charge. He knows these guys from working at Tottenham and values their input. Tony Parks, former goalkeeping coach at Spurs, arrived in the days after the loss to Stoke, curtailing a move to Norwich to join up with a manager he respects greatly. Parks is a trusted friend and vocal presence on the touchline, the one who bear-hugged Sherwood from behind, lifting him off his feet, when Benteke rolled in the stoppage time penalty to beat West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League. As assistant Sherwood made a smart move, offering Kevin McDonald the chance to renew his Villa relationship. The 54-year-old was the club\u2019s hugely successful reserve team boss and has developed younger players during a 17-year association that ended during the early days of Lambert's reign in June 2012. He was also caretaker manager after Martin O\u2019Neill left and nearly got the job permanently. \u2018I wanted someone who knew the fabric of the club,\u2019 says Sherwood. Tony Parks (left centre) was one of many new staff members brought in to help save Villa from relegation. Stiliyan Petrov has also been into the dressing room to offer words of advice, although he is yet to formalise any coaching arrangement. Training is sharp and intense, largely tailored to replicate matchdays and goal-scoring situations. Inspiring confidence. Sherwood said after the victory over Liverpool that the players believed they would win and the fans did too, suggesting many had already booked their hotels for the final on May 30. It is clear confidence is coursing through this Villa team now, the shackles not being so much thrown off as plunged to the bottom of the ocean to collect rust. The 46-year-old has added a new found confidence to his sides game and is reaping the benefits. Sherwood divides opinion with his outspoken comments but from within the club such positivity has spread to form a confident collective unit. 'He sits and he chats to people. He treats people like men,\u2019 says Parks. \u2018The guys have responded to that \u2013 sitting them down, treating them with respect, letting them know when they\u2019re playing well, letting them know when they\u2019re not playing so well. \u2018I look around, he\u2019s the manager and I believe what he tells me. I think the players believe what he tells them as well. He\u2019s a good leader.'\n","right_summary":"Tim Sherwood has had an instant impact since taking over at Aston Villa.

{"document":"Stock market returns have averaged 16 per cent a year under David Cameron's Conservatives party, compared to just under nine per cent under Labour. Shares have performed nearly twice as well under Conservative governments than under Labour over the last 45 years, according to figures published today. Stock market returns have averaged 16 per cent a year under the Tories compared with just under 9 per cent under Labour and just over 9 per cent under the current Coalition. The figures, in an analysis for the Daily Mail by investment company Hargreaves Lansdown, are a further boost for David Cameron and George Osborne ahead of the general election on May 7. Ed Miliband is struggling to win over business men and women as well as investors who are worried about a Left-wing Labour government\u2019s attitudes to enterprise. A survey of FTSE 100 bosses this weekend showed 70 per cent believe a Labour government under Mr Miliband would be a \u2018catastrophe\u2019 for the economy. The analysis by Hargreaves Lansdown shows investors \u2013 including millions of workers saving for a pension \u2013 fare better under the Conservatives. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u2018The stock market has performed twice as well under a Conservative government as it has under Labour, according to performance statistics dating back to 1970.\u2019 The analysis shows that companies have also performed better under the Tories with profits up by an average of 11 per cent a year under the Conservatives and 6 per cent under Labour. Writing in the Daily Mail, Mr Khalaf said: \u2018Over the last 45 years there have been five Conservative governments, five Labour governments, and the current Coalition. \u2018Over that time the UK stock market has returned on average 16 per cent a year under Conservative rule, compared with 9 per cent under Labour. \u2018Markets can be capricious beasts in the short term, but on average this trend reflects the growth in UK company profits under the two parties.\u2019 However, he said events on the global stage \u2018are far more important to the UK stock market than the next resident of Number 10\u2019. He added: \u2018Looking back over the last 45 years, the waxing and waning of the stock market has been driven in large part by overseas influences, and is not commanded from Westminster.

{"document":"A trim 120-pound mother-of-four set a new world record this weekend and earned $6,000 in prize money after downing three 72-ounce steak dinners in just 20 minutes. Competitive eater Mary Schuyler accomplished the stunning feat in front of hundreds at the Big Texan Steak Ranch restaurant in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday. Schuyler is such a champ that the four teams of two that competed against her didn't even come close to winning - even though they were allowed to split their dinners. Scroll down for video. Winner, winner, steak dinner: Molly Schuyler won the 72-ounce steak dinner challenge at the Big Texan Steack Ranch restaurant in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday. Fast eater: The 120-pound mother-of-four ate three steak dinners - complete with sides - in just 20 minutes. Worth it: For breaking the record for quickest steak dinner eaten and for finishing her three meals in under an hour, Schuyler took home a grand total of $6,000. In addition to the three massive 72-ounce steaks, competitors also had to eat three baked potatoes, three shrimp cocktails, three salads and three rolls for a whopping 15 pounds of food. While that might sound daunting to most, Schuyler was confident that she would beat out the other competitors with her experience. 'They would have had to eat their half in like four minutes,' Schuyler told the Amarillo Globe-News. 'If you\u2019re not used to doing this, four minutes is hard.' Filling: The dinner included three 72-ounce steaks, three shrimp cocktails, three baked potatoes, three salads and three rolls. Champion: Though her competitors were allowed to tackle the challenge in teams of two, none came close to winning the competition. She cleaned her plate: Schuyler poses with a fan after the feat, showing off her belly bloated from the competition. However, she was a bit nervous about tackling a three steak dinners since she ate just two when she competed at the restaurant last year. 'I come in thinking I'm going to fail, but you know if I win it's a lovely parting gift and that's cool,' she told KFDA-TV. 'I also get free steak so I don't really lose.' As the competition began, Schuyler covered up with a pair of sunglasses and put up her sweatshirt hood to focus on the task at hand and finished her first steak in just four minutes and 18 seconds - beating the previous record she set last year of four minutes and 48 seconds. Hundreds cheered her on below the competition table set up side the restaurant on a sunny day, as Schuyler ripped her way through the steaks. Competitors had an hour to finish their $72 dinners, in order to get them for free, but Schuyler cleaned her plates in a cool 20. And with enough time to spare, Schuyler tried attacking a fourth steak but had to stop, saying she was tired of the taste. Schuyler was born and raised in Nebraska and currently residents in Sacramento California. Before her competitive food eating life, she worked as a bartender and server at Applebee\u2019s. In August 2012, Schuyler entered her first competitive eating competition, becoming the first woman to finish the Stellanator at Stella Bar in Omaha, Nebraska. The Stellanator includes six hamburger patties, six eggs, six pieces of cheese, six pieces of bacon topped with fried onions, jalapenos, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, two buns and mayonnaise. Another to add to the trophy cabinet: Schuyler pictured above winning the Z-Burger contest in Washington, DC last July. During the competition she ate 24 hamburgers in ten minutes. Since then, Schuyler has been competing regularly in food eating competitions - including one weekend in 2014 when she competed in FOUR food competitions. On January 31, 2014, Schuyler won Wing Bowl 22 in Philadelphia, by eating 363 wings. The next day, she competed in and won both the IHOP Pancake bowl and the bacon-eating contest at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival in Des Moines. She finished out the weekend by taking on the Adam Emmenecker Challenge at Jethro\u2019s Barbecue. Schuyler first took on the Emmenecker challenge in December 2012, when she became the first woman to complete the meal that includes a spicy pickle, bun, pork tenderloin, buffalo chicken tenders, white cheddar sauce, fried cheese cubes, Texas brisket, applewood smoked bacon, cheeseburger and a pound of waffle fries...in just 15 minutes. Dessert: Schuyler guzzles down\u00a012 pounds of rice pudding in three minutes to set a new world record last year. Hero: Last year Mrs Schuyler smashed another record by demolishing a 12-pound sandwich, one pound of French fries and a large soda as part of the Mad Greek Deli Challenge in Portland, Oregon. Schuyler started the competition at her normal 120 pounds, but by the time she was crowned winner, she had gained 15 pounds and her stomach noticeably filled out. Her physique was quite a contrast to the larger men who decided to take her on in the eating competition including a team of two professional wrestlers and two members of the Amarillo Venum indoor football team. For setting the record for fastest eaten steak dinner, Schuyler won $1,000 and another $5,000 for completing the challenge in less than an hour. What's more - Schuyler says she plans to come back next year and break her record, upping the ante to four steaks instead of three. Bobby Lee, the co-owner of the Big Texas, says the restaurant was floored by her performance and that they'll be submitting her record to Guinness. 'We've been doing this contest since 1960, and in all that time we've never had anybody come in to actually eat that many steaks at one time- so this is a first for us and after 55 years of it, it's a big deal,' Lee told ABC 7. Schuyler started competing in eating competition in August 2012, and has broken several records during her brief career. In January 2014, she set ate 363 wings in just 20 minutes, earning $22,000 prize for that competition.\n","right_summary":"Molly Schuyler won the 72-ounce steak dinner challenge at Big Texan Steak Ranch in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday.

{"document":"Goodness knows how many times at White Hart Lane I\u2019ve felt like falling to my knees at the back of the West Stand and banging my head on the floor. I\u2019ve lost count. A lifetime of following Spurs can have that effect on you, especially in recent years. Last Saturday\u2019s inept capitulation to Aston Villa was the most recent occasion: a soft goal down after 45 minutes and an expensively assembled team which looked as if it had been recruited from the local JobCentre half an hour before the kick-off. Stephen Dodd took this photograph of Asif Bodi and Abubakar Bhula praying at Anfield last month. Had I actually gone through with it, however, within seconds I\u2019d have been hauled to my feet by the stewards and steered unceremoniously towards the exit. They are especially vigilant when it comes to anyone blocking the gangways or stairwells. And given football\u2019s tragic history, from Ibrox to Hillsborough, their caution is well-merited. So it was surprising, to say the least, to see that photograph of two Muslim Liverpool supporters praying to Mecca at half-time in an FA Cup match. They had rolled out their prayer mat at the foot of some stairs beneath the stand, apparently with the full consent of safety staff. One of the men, solicitor Asif Bodi, 46, from Preston, explained that because the televised game didn\u2019t kick off until 4pm, the final whistle would have blown too late for them to pray outside the ground. So perhaps we can point the finger at television. Matches are shifted all over the shop by the schedulers, for purely commercial reasons. For instance, those irritating lunchtime games are designed for the benefit of bookmakers and betting syndicates in the Far East, not season ticket holders. Travelling fans often complain that evening games mean it is impossible for them to catch the last train home. But this may be the first time that a late kick-off for the convenience of television has played havoc with the Muslim call to prayer. The extraordinary scene was captured on a mobile phone camera by Liverpool supporter Stephen Dodd. He tweeted the photograph with the caption \u2018Muslims praying at half-time at the match yesterday #DISGRACE.\u2019 In no time, predictably, the balloon went up. With the customary restraint for which social media is renowned, the usual online lynch-mob were branding him a \u2018bigot\u2019 and a \u2018disgrace to humanity\u2019. The incident took place when Liverpool were playing Blackburn Rovers at Anfield in March. Needless to say, someone reported the tweet to Merseyside Police, who for once exercised commendable sanity and decided not to get involved. But Liverpool FC is investigating, saying discrimination will not be tolerated and promising to take \u2018appropriate action\u2019. To their enormous credit, Mr Bodi and his partner in prayer Abubakar Bhula are urging restraint. \u2018I\u2019ve supported Liverpool for 40 years and I used to be a season ticket holder,\u2019 Mr Bodi said. \u2018From what I understand, this guy doesn\u2019t live too far from the ground and is probably a boyhood fan, so I wouldn\u2019t want him excluded from the ground or anything. \u2018He should be given a talking to and made to go on an awareness course or educating.\u2019 Why? Most people would agree that labelling the photograph a #DISGRACE was an intemperate over-reaction. But this was a real \u2018Oi, Doris!\u2019 moment. You don\u2019t expect to stumble over Muslims praying in a stairwell at a football ground midway through a Cup tie. Quite apart from the safety considerations, even those of us who believe people should be free to practise their religion of choice also believe there is a time and a place. And Scousers go to Anfield to worship at the shrine of Shankly, not Allah or the Almighty. How would the management have reacted if some devout Catholics had decided to stage a holy communion at half-time? Or the queue for the gents\u2019 was obstructed by a conga line of chanting Hare Krishnas? What if a handful of Liverpool fans had turned up at the local mosque and started singing You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone in the middle of Friday prayers? Would their claim to be exercising their democratic right to celebrate their religion stop the Old Bill steaming in and nicking them for \u2018hate crime\u2019? What do you think? Mr Bodi seems to be an eminently reasonable and civilised man. What I\u2019d like to ask him would be when, in his four decades of supporting Liverpool, he first started praying during games at Anfield? I may be wrong, but my guess would be that this is a fairly recent phenomenon. As the Muslim population of Britain has grown to three million, Islamic \u2018rights\u2019 have become increasingly more assertive. We have de facto Sharia law in some areas of our cities; halal food imposed in schools, hospitals and works\u2019 canteens; and now even gelatine-free halal Pick\u2019n\u2019Mix counters in supermarkets. Over the past decade or so, what we have seen is British society being obliged to bend to the demands of Islam. Such is the contradiction inherent in our State-imposed \u2018multiculturalism\u2019 tyranny that more latitude is extended to Muslims than any other group or religion. Look, I\u2019m a supporter of the FA\u2019s anti-racism Kick It Out campaign. Football crowds are gradually becoming more diverse, and not before time. This remarkable photograph from Anfield is evidence of that. The game is awakening to cultural differences. At the League Cup Final in Cardiff a few years ago, they were selling balti pies at the Blackburn end, while knocking out over-priced smoked salmon bagels in the Spurs\u2019 section of the stadium. Someone must have told them Blackburn has one of Britain\u2019s biggest Asian populations and Tottenham has a large number of Jewish supporters. So no stereotyping there, then. Balti pies are one thing. But back to more serious matters. Didn\u2019t it occur to Mr Bodi and Mr Bhula that if the kick-off at Anfield clashed with their religious obligations then perhaps the wisest course of action would simply be to give the game a miss? OK, so there were only two of them this time. But what if next season there\u2019s a dozen, or two dozen, or 200, all expecting the right to pray where they like? Where do you draw the line? At this rate, it won\u2019t be long before Muslim fans start demanding special prayer rooms at football grounds, just as there are already in public buildings and police custody suites. Soon it will become a legal requirement. When it does, remember: you read it here first. A Polish prince, Yanek Zylinski, has challenged Nigel Farage to a duel in London\u2019s Hyde Park, accusing the Ukip leader of stirring up hatred against Eastern European immigrants. Brandishing a sabre, he threw down the gauntlet: \u2018Are you up for it, Mr Farage?\u2019 He\u2019ll have to get Farage out of the pub first. Maybe it would be better if he challenged him to a vodka drinking contest. I\u2019d be happy to referee, in exchange for a couple of bottles of Wyborowa. If it\u2019s a duel he\u2019s after, Zylinski should invite Cameron. Dave probably learnt to fence at Eton. Come to think of it, instead of bothering with the campaign, why not a series of Generation Game-style contests to decide the election? William \u201814 pints\u2019 Hague could represent the Tories in the drinking round. Cleggover and Miliband could stage a winner-takes-all bacon sandwich eating competition. And how about a mud-wrestling tournament, involving Theresa May, Harriet Harman, Wee Burney, that Welsh bird and the Aussie madwoman from the Greens? It would certainly beat the hell out of last night\u2019s Leaders\u2019 Debate. Bristols at dawn! Sorry, but I don't agree with Nick. When the BBC\u2019s political editor Nick Robinson went off air in March to be treated for a tumour on his lung, I wished him a speedy recovery. I\u2019m an admirer of Robinson and at the time described him as a beacon of impartiality in a bog of BBC bias. This week he returned, but with such a raspy, whispery voice it was difficult to make out what he was saying. Nick Robinson's eagerness to resume work is understandable, but he should have been told to complete his recovery. His eagerness to resume work is understandable, but he should have been told to complete his recovery. He\u2019s not doing the viewers or, more importantly, himself any favours. It\u2019s like Andy Murray going on to Centre Court with one arm in plaster. Get well, soon, Nick. And don\u2019t worry about the election for now. You\u2019re not missing much. A woman cried rape when her boyfriend found out that she had taken part in a threesome with a married couple, Aberdeen Sheriff Court has been told. But Hannah McWhirter had been a willing participant and exchanged texts with the couple telling them how much she\u2019d enjoyed it. This week she admitted wasting police time and was remanded for reports. Given the bracing weather in Aberdeen, she should have told her boyfriend they were only huddling together to keep warm. Fore! That's a long drive. The day after I wondered why fitness freaks have to wear electronic wrist-bands to monitor their every bodily function, the British Medical Journal published a report claiming health apps are positively harmful \u2014 because they convince the \u2018worried well\u2019 that there\u2019s something seriously wrong with them. Spooky, or what? You can also get wrist-bands which tell you the distances to the holes on every golf course in Britain. A friend of mine checked his app as he was driving home from a golf tour of Scotland. It told him he was 253 miles from the 18th green at Gleneagles.\n","right_summary":"Image shows two men praying at half-time during FA Cup clash.

In an interview with Puss Puss magazine, the stylish cook, 35,  posed at a feast fit for only the classiest cat, that included bowls brimming with caviar and salmon roe, jellied fish heads, a seafood sculpture made of octopus, lobster and prawns. Although the lavish feast was in fact a set (created by food stylist Iain Graham), the cat fancier admitted that her British shorthair, Kimchi, has such a discerning palate he loves crunchy 'human food'  and that taramasalata would be his 'death row dish'.

But Kimchi occasionally indulges in cat food and is 'obsessed' with Dreamies cat biscuits. 'It\u2019s insane,' says Gizzi. 'She purrs as she eats and she doesn\u2019t do that normally.' Gizzi also recently added a new addition to her cat family, Ponzu, named after her favourite Japanese dressing. 'I was also thinking about calling him Neeps or Haggis as he\u2019s Scottish, but it didn\u2019t suit him, so eventually I just went with what suited him best. He was nameless for a week,' she says.

{"document":"A 13-year-old boy who was allegedly locked in a basement for 11 days has testified against his father and stepmother in court, saying his home was a 'very terrible' place where he was often beaten with a plastic pipe, forced to rise before dawn for workouts and isolated from other children. He revealed his treatment was so horrific, he attempted suicide in a bid to escape his parents' torture. Taking the stand against Charlie Bothuell IV and Monique Dillard-Bothuell on Tuesday, Charlie Bothuell, who was 12 when he was found in the basement, described the horrors of his home life. 'It was a very terrible place to be,' he told the court of his family's Detroit townhouse. 'I was expected to do everything perfectly. I was never given any leeway, to make a mistake and learn from it.' Charlie, who wore glasses, a white shirt, a tie and black pants for his hour-long testimony, was speaking publicly for the first time since he was found in his family's cluttered and dirty basement. Scroll down for video. Testimony: Charlie Bothuell (pictured), now 13, was found in the basement of his family's Detroit townhouse last June following an 11-day search. On Tuesday, he testified in court against his father and stepmother. Basement: Taking the stand against Charlie Bothuell IV and Monique Dillard-Bothuell on Tuesday, Charlie, who was 12 when he was found in the tiny, dirty basement (pictured), described the horrors of his home life. 'Weapon': He said his home was a 'very terrible' place where he was beaten with this plastic pipe (pictured being presented as evidence in court), forced to rise before dawn for workouts and isolated from other kids. Police officers who dramatically rescued the youngster on the eleventh day of a wide-scale search for him also found a blanket, cereal box, drinks bottles and a bowl of chicken bones in the tiny room. The hearing is meant to determine if there is enough evidence to send Bothuell IV and his partner to trial on charges of torture and child abuse. A 36th District Court judge will make the decision. During Tuesday's testimony, Charlie did not look at the prosecutor as he described how he was educated at home from 2012. His daily routine involved waking up at 5am for a protein shake. He was then forced to endure vigorous workouts that lasted up to two hours, followed by a shower, math and science lessons with old books, chores and another workout, he told the court. 'What would happen if you didn't do this routine?' asked the prosecutor. Charlie replied: 'I would get in trouble, a whipping.' The youngster said he tried to run away aged 11, but police found him. After he was returned home, 'I was told to basically lay across the dining room table and was spanked on the butt with a wooden stick and then a plastic PVC pipe,' Charlie told the court. Accused: 'It was a very terrible place to be,' Charlie said. 'I was expected to do everything perfectly. I was never given any leeway, to make a mistake and learn from it.'

Charlie's face was not pictured by the press as he gave his testimony; only his hands were shown (above) He recalled other 'whoopings' with sticks and pipes, which would cause the skin on his buttocks to bleed and 'split open'. 'Why did you lay over the dining room table,' the prosecutor asked him. According to Fox 2, Charlie replied: 'Because I was told to. (I) laid over the dining room table and I would be basically smacked on the butt.' The prosecutor then inquired: 'With what?' 'A wooden stick,' Charlie said. 'Then a plastic PVC pipe.' He added that his stepmother would sometimes punch him - and once even choked him. He was left feeling depressed and upset. The expectations about life at home were \"absolutely ridiculous', said Charlie, detailing how was made to stand in the corner with his arms held above his head if he did not complete assignments. 'They decided when they wanted me to stop. It was so painful,' he said. He added that he even attempted suicide in a bid to escape the abusive conditions at his home,\u00a0WXYZ reported. Home: A neighbor near the Bothuells' home showed Daily Mail Online the bathroom that Charlie likely used. Tunnel: The bathroom was accessible via this tunnel (right), according to the neighbor, The tunnel's outside door (left) is usually locked and only accessible to maintenance men, but crucially, it was left open during the time Charlie was missing so that residents could get rid of a build-up of trash in a dumpster left outside. Discovery: Police officers who dramatically rescued the youngster from the house (pictured) on the eleventh day of a wide-scale search also found a blanket, cereal box and a bowl of chicken bones in the basement. Earlier in the hearing, detective Sgt. Ken Ducker testified about finding Charlie in the roughly 600-square-foot space when he went downstairs looking for evidence that might help the search. 'I was not expecting to find him,' Ducker said. A doctor said the boy was thin with several bruises. Defense attorneys claim Charlie is a liar who left and returned to the house on his own. Bothuell IV insists he didn't know his son was in the basement, which has no door at the top of the stairs. Attorney Shawn Smith asked Ducker if he believed the boy - who is now living with his mother - was in the basement for all 11 days, but a prosecutor objected. The question went unanswered. Judge Shannon Holmes ended the hearing before Charlie was asked about what happened last June. The youngster, who had lived with his father for two years, will return to court on May 6. Reaction: Bothuell IV, who insists he didn't know his son was in the basement, was giving a live TV interview when he was told his son had been found by police.

Success Kid -- now an 8-year-old named Sammy Griner -- needs a little bit of that mojo to rub off on his family.  His dad, Justin, needs a kidney transplant. About a week ago, Laney Griner, Justin's wife and Sammy's mother, created a GoFundMe campaign with a goal of $75,000 to help cover the medical expenses that go along with a kidney transplant. The campaign is already a success. By Wednesday it had topped its goal. Griner told The Daily Dot that her husband was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2006 and suffered complete kidney failure three years later. \"One can only survive with no natural kidney function ... for so long,\" Laney Griner said. \"His energy and mood are affected; he can no longer work, and he spends 12 hours a week in dialysis clinic. \"Having been on dialysis for this long greatly increases his risks of developing further complications. The only way to save his life is to get a transplant. There's no other way around that,\" she said. The family doesn't know when a kidney might become available.  Their GoFundMe page has a link for potential donors. Sammy's Internet fame began in 2007 when his mom posted a picture of him on a beach with a fist full of sand and a satisfied look on his face.

{"document":"A monkey that was thought to have died out more than 50 years ago has been discovered alive in the remote rain forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Primatologists working in Ntokou-Pikounda National Park have captured the first ever picture of the Bouvier's red colobus monkey. Their discovery proves that the primate - which was first discovered in 1887 and is only known from three specimens - is not extinct. Scroll down for video. This is the first ever photograph of the Bouvier's red colobus monkey, which was thought to have been extinct. The image captured by researchers\u00a0Lieven Devreese and Ga\u00ebl Elie Gnondo Gobolo appears to show a mother with her young. Researchers now hope to study the monkey in an attempt to learn more about it. A new species of monkey has been discovered after scientists learned to distinguish it by the appearance of its penis. The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped\u00a0genitalia found on other species in the area. Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. Mr Devreese said: 'Our photos are the world's first and confirm that the species is not extinct. 'No one knows anything about them. They live in an area where scientists rarely go, along the banks of a river a in a very inaccessible area.' Mr Devreese spent three months, after setting off in February, searching the jungles of Congo in an attempt to find the Bouvier red colobus monkeys, or Piliocolobus bouvieri. Together with his Congelese colleagues, he visited remote villages to ask locals if they had seen them and traced the locations of unconfirmed reports of sightings. A group of the monkeys were discovered living in the forests that sit along the Bokiba River in the Ntokou-Pikounda National Park. However, they found that the creatures appear to be extremely vulnerable to hunters involved in the commercial bushmeat trade in the area. Red colobus monkeys are among the largest primates in the forests of Congo and are prized by hunters. The animals are also poor at recognising threats, often believing they are safe in the trees. Rather than fleeing, red colobus monkeys tend to look down at humans from the trees. The last unconfirmed sighting of a Bouvier's red colobus monkey was in the 1970s and they are mentioned in a book from 1949 as living in swamp forests aong the Likouala and Sangha rivers. In his attempt to rediscover the monkeys, Mr Devreese launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the expedition on Indiegogo. A video is shown above. The Bouvier's red colobus monkey lives in stretches of jungle alongside rivers in the Congo (pictured above) The only previous examples of them had been collected more than 100 years ago. In his attempt to rediscover the monkeys, Mr Devreese launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the expedition on Indiegogo. Dr Fiona Maisels, from the Wildlife Conservation Society, said: 'We\u2019re very pleased indeed that Lieven and Ga\u00ebl were able to achieve their objective of not only confirming that Bouvier\u2019s red colobus still exists, but also managing to get a very clear close-up picture of a mother and infant. 'Thankfully, many of these colobus monkeys live in the recently gazetted national park and are protected from threats such as logging, agriculture, and roads, all of which can lead to increased hunting.' James Deutsch, vice president for conservation strategy at the WCS, added: 'Confirmation that Bouvier\u2019s red colobus still thrives in the this area reminds us that there remain substantially intact wild places on Earth, and should re-energize all of us to save them before it is too late.'\n","right_summary":"Bouvier's red colobus monkeys was last sighted in the Congo during 1970s.

The Italian seems to have enjoyed more success in West Yorkshire where he has forged an official link to Bradford, a club which has been one of the great success stories of the season. Former QPR chief Gianni Paladini appears to be keen on taking over the reins at League One side Bradford. Bradford's most memorable moment of the season came during their shock FA Cup win over Chelsea. Phil Parkinson\u2019s team captured the imagination of fans across the nation when they fought back from 2-0 down to win 4-2 at Chelsea in the FA Cup and went on to beat Sunderland before losing in a quarter-final replay at Reading.

They took 8,000 supporters to Stamford Bridge and generated a brilliant atmosphere for the tie at home to Sunderland. It was a reminder of the club\u2019s enormous potential, having been led out of the doldrums of League Two and administration by chairmen Julian Rhodes and Mark Lawn, with the help of Parkinson\u2019s managerial skill. Lawn has spoken of the need to attract new investment and Paladini is registered as the sole director of Bradford City (Holdings) Limited, set up in February.

Google is said to be in talks with Hutchison Whampoa, the owner of the Three network, to let its users make calls and send texts in any country at no extra cost. Industry sources said the firms are discussing a 'wholesale access agreement' that would help Google create a global network. Customers would then be able to use this global network to make calls, send texts and use data as part of their plan, regardless of where in the world they are. In particular, a deal with Hutchison would extend the service to the UK, Ireland, Italy and Spain., but the plans would only affect the small base of customers on Google's plan. Last week Three extending its Feel at Home scheme to Spain and New Zealand. Feel at Home lets Three customers use their phones, and their plans, in the same way they can at home even when they're in a foreign country. Spain and New Zealand take the total number of Feel at Home countries to 18. The other nations include France, Switzerland, Israel, Norway, Sri Lanka, Australia, Finland, Indonesia, Macau, Italy, Austria, Hong Kong, Sweden, Denmark, the Republic of Ireland and the USA. Three already offers a similar scheme called Feel at Home that lets customers use their phones and their plans in 18  countries. Google's vice president Sundar Pichai confirmed rumours his firm was launching a mobile network plan during during a talk at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. It will be initially offered to cities that have Google Fiber, such as Kansas, Texas and Utah and Google is working with network operators on developing the cellular plan. \u2018You will see us announce it in the coming months, I think we are at a stage where it is important to think about hardware, software and connectability together,\u2019 said the 43-year-old. The rumours of a Google mobile network plan first emerged in April last year. Instead of building masts, Google will buy access to existing 3G and 4G networks at wholesale prices and sell the connectivity back to customers at a cheaper rate. Three already offers a similar scheme called Feel at Home (pictured) that lets customers use their phones and their plans for free, in 18 countries. Spain and New Zealand were the latest countries to join this scheme. A mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) is a company that offers mobile service plans using existing networks. MVNOs don't own the infrastructure the networks are built on. Instead, they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices. The company can then use this access to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate. Lycamobile in the U.S, for example, is an MVNO because it runs on T-Mobile\u2019s network. In the UK, Tesco Mobile shares O2\u2019s, and ultimately Telefonica\u2019s, networks. An MVNO is typically run as an independent company, with its own staff and customer service. This would make Google a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) similar to Lycamobile in the US that runs on T-Mobile\u2019s network, and Tesco Mobile in the UK which shares O2\u2019s networks. MVNOs don't own the infrastructure the networks are built on. Instead, they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices. The company can then use these network to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate. Mr Pinchai said: \u2018We want to be able to experiment along those lines, [but] we don't intend to be a network operator at scale.\u2019 He described the plans as a \u2018project\u2019 and will do it on a small enough scale to not threaten existing networks. In particular, Mr Pichai said the setup should provide at seamless connection between Wi-Fi and mobile networks. Sources said at the time of the original rumours that any Google-branded mobile network would initially launch in cities that have Google Fiber. Google launched its 1000mps Fiber broadband service in 2011, starting with Kansas City. Google's vice president Sundar Pichai (pictured) confirmed rumours his firm was launching a mobile network plan during during a talk at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February.\u00a0Instead of building masts, Google will buy access to existing networks and sell connectivity back to customers at a cheaper rate. Travelex has launched a 'Supercard' that makes fees charged by banks for using your card abroad a thing of the past. Based on an average 10-day holiday, Travelex told MailOnline a family of four could save almost \u00a3110. The Supercard looks and works like a standard debit card, but it connects to an app and lets users consolidate multiple cards onto one account. The banking fees are paid for by Travelex and savings are shown in real-time. And if a card is lost or stolen it can be blocked using the app. In 2013, the firm announced it was expanding the service to Austin in Texas, Provo in Utah and a number of other towns in Missouri and California. More locations are due to be added later this year, but the roll-out is slow because Google has to install the relevant infrastructure needed. Google Fiber starts at $70 (\u00a342) a month and has been praised for offering high speeds at relatively low prices. Google\u2019s wireless plans would remove some of the costs, and time spent, in setting up its own network and it would equally benefit from using already established and well-connected networks. This could help Google cement itself as an internet service provider. Google could additionally use the network to sell its Nexus range of phones, for example, with contract or service plans.\n","right_summary":"Google is said to be in talks with Hutchison Whampoa, which owns Three.

{"document":"The owner of the East Village building that blew up last week and left two dead people could yet face criminal charges, it has emerged. Nicholas Figueroa, 23, and Moises Locon, 26, both died when the Manhattan apartment building collapsed last Thursday following a massive blast. Investigators have now shifted their focus to what caused the explosion, with suggestions someone may have improperly tapped a gas line serving one of the buildings. Scroll down for video. The clean up continued yesterday at the site where several buildings collapsed following the ferocious blaze. A crane removes large pieces of debris as firefighters watch on from the roof of a neighbouring building. Firefighters watch the clean up continue at the site of the explosion which killed two people. In August utility workers discovered the gas line to the restaurant had been illegally tapped, it has emerged. Nicholas Figueroa (left) was killed in the explosion while on a date, while Moises Lucon (right) worked at the restaurant and was identified yesterday as the second victim. The New York Post reported an investigation is now underway into possible gas tapping, with a criminal case expanded to include Haria Hrynenko, the building's landlord. Sources told the paper possible charges include second-degree manslaughter and reckless endangerment. The explosion at 121 Second Avenue in the East Village set alight the property, while its neighboring buildings, 119, 123 and 125 Second Avenue, were also engulfed before all three buildings completely collapsed to the ground, leaving a massive hole on the corner of the block at 7th Street. The medical examiner yesterday confirmed the identity of the second victim using DNA analysis as that of restaurant worker Moises Locon. He had been working six days a week and his family said during his free time he enjoyed taking his nephew to a Queens park. He was reported missing after the explosion and his body found days later. Another 22 people were injured. Meanwhile, in August, utility workers had discovered that the gas line to the restaurant had been illegally tapped, according to Consolidated Edison. Firefighters battle the flames following the explosion at 121 Second Avenue in the East Village last week. The off-duty first responder reached the ground just in time, because just moments later the fire intensified. Horror: Looking towards the fire from Astor Place, flames could be seen reaching into the sky. The discovery led Con Edison to shut down gas service to the building for about 10 days while the building owner made repairs. Gas service was restored after the utility deemed it safe, the utility said. Inspectors from Con Ed visited that building about an hour before last week's explosion and determined work to upgrade gas service didn't pass inspection, locking the line to ensure it wouldn't be used and then leaving, it was claimed. The work underway was to put in a bigger line to serve the entire building, Con Ed President Craig Ivey said. Fifteen minutes later, the sushi restaurant's owner smelled gas and called the landlord, who called the general contractor, Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said. No one called emergency dispatch or Con Ed. The contractor, Dilber Kukic, and the owner's son went into the basement and opened a door, and then the explosion happened, burning their faces, Boyce said. Kukic - who's facing unrelated charges of bribing an undercover investigator posing as a housing inspector - declined through his lawyer to comment on the circumstances surrounding the explosion. Firefighters continued to blast water at pockets of flames among the rubble the following day. Photographs taken on Friday showed three buildings entirely collapsed following the explosion. The city's mayor said it could take up to a week for the rubble to be cleared from the explosion site.\n","right_summary":"Owner of Manhattan building which exploded could face criminal charges.

{"document":"Britain's leading pensions and savings expert will today be announced as a new Conservative peer, who will appointed as Minister for Consumer Protection if the party wins the election. Dr Ros Altmann, a former Treasury adviser who went on to head over-50s group Saga, would take responsibility for protecting people from rip-off pension and mortgage charges. She would also be in charge of financial education and Government policy to reward and encourage saving. Dr Ros Altmann, pictured with David Cameron at Melbicks, a Wyevale Garden Centre in Birmingham, will today be announced as a new Conservative peer. Dr Altmann will oversee the Government\u2019s pension reforms, which have allowed people to cash in retirement funds rather than being forced into buying often poor-value annuities. She will also steer through reforms designed to make it easier for customers to move to another bank, by allowing customers to take their account number with them. \u2018For too many years, consumer rights have played second fiddle to the interests of large financial firms, but the new pension freedoms show that the Conservatives have put the interests of British savers first,\u2019 Dr Altmann said. \u2018I passionately believe the new pension reforms, trusting people with their own money, are an essential step to helping everyone make the most of their hard-earned savings. 'David Cameron and George Osborne have proved to me that they want to help the many, not just the few at the top, by giving the same freedoms to everyone as were already enjoyed by the wealthiest. \u2018In doing so, they took on the large companies who had too often taken advantage of their customers and have paved the way for a new environment for long-term savings. The Conservatives have created the opportunity for working families to save more if and when they can, knowing they will be allowed to use the money as best suits their circumstances. Dr Ros Altmann, a former Treasury adviser who went on to head over-50s group Saga, would take responsibility for protecting people from rip-off pension and mortgage charges. \u2018That is right, but of course it will also require a change of mindset from providers and potentially further action from Government to protect consumers. It will be my job to try to ensure customers get a better deal and I am delighted to be offered the chance to do so. \u2018Charge caps, impartial financial guidance, help with financial planning, financial education at all ages, and more competition for savers\u2019 money will all help and it will be great to have the opportunity to play a direct role in looking after the public.\u2019 The Prime Minister said: \u2018What we\u2019re doing is taking the country\u2019s leading expert on pensions, on savings, on financial education, Ros Altmann, and saying that if we\u2019re re-elected, she\u2019ll be at the heart of government, making sure we complete this great revolution where we\u2019re giving people much more power to save, to access their pension, to pass their pension on to their children, because we want to create a real savings culture in our country for everybody. 'Not for the rich at the top, but for everybody who saves or has a pension.' \u2018This will be good for everybody. We\u2019ve got millions more people saving for a pension because of auto-enrolment - having an automatic pension in your workplace - so there are many more people saving. 'There are also great new products like the flexible ISA, a real encouragement for savings with the single tier pension, and now at the heart of government, if we\u2019re elected, Ros Altmann - the country\u2019s leading pensions, savings, and financial education expert to make sure that we make the most of this great revolution in favour of savings and financial security for many in our country.\u2019\n","right_summary":"Dr Ros Altmann will be announced as a new Conservative peer today.

{"document":"The richest fight of all time continues to break through the barriers of history \u2013 mostly in terms of financial records, naturally. For the first time in the annals of boxing \u2013 as Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao step on the scales next Friday \u2013 fans will be charged for admission to a weigh-in. This formality for checking that combatants weigh no more than the stipulated poundage for each division started to become an event in its own right in 2007 when Ricky Hatton went to Las Vegas to take his Man Of La Mancha tilt at the Mayweather windmill. Floyd Mayweather with girlfriend Doralie Medina (left) and Manny Pacquiao with his wife Jinkee (right) Pacquiao with his wife and  children (left to right) Michael, Israel, Emmanuel, Princess and Queen Elizabeth. Mayweather visits SubZero Recovery in Las Vegas, a new-age version of the ice bath. No fewer than 30,000 of the Manchester Hitman's army followed him across the Atlantic and thousands of them turned up for the weigh-in. The atmosphere was electrified when Hatton yelled 'let's be having him' as Mayweather was about to follow him onto the stage. Hatton would be knocked out but there was more of the same when he went back to the MGM Grand to suffer the same fate against Pacquiao two years later. Since then weigh-ins there have turned into sound and light spectacles, taking place inside the Grand Garden Arena itself, and the audiences keep growing. The decision to sell tickets for this one has been made in the interests of safety, not profit. Up to 200,000 visitors are expected to pour into Vegas this fight week and the MGM need to control the crowds at all the associated events. Thousands of fans watched Ricky Hatton and Mayweather weigh-in at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Hatton points towards the crowd during his heated weigh-in with Mayweather in December 2007. Mayweather poses in his TMT clothing as he takes a break from training over the weekend. To avoid accusations of cashing in on the phenomenon the hotel and both promoters \u2013 Mayweather and Top Rank \u2013 will donate all revenue from the weigh-in to charities nominated by the Money Man and the PacMan. Mayweather and Pacquiao will be required to weigh not more than 10st 7lbs. The winner will unify the WBC (Mayweather) and WBO (Pacquiao) world welterweight titles. Wladimir Klitschko, as he makes a rare appearance in the US this Saturday, admits that at 39 he has to start considering when he might hang up those huge gloves. However, assuming he adds Bryant Jennings to his long list of victims, that will not happen before Dr Iron Fist has obliged the two young pretenders to his heavyweight throne. Namely our own Tyson Fury and America's KO sensation Deontay Wilder. Wladimir Klitschko has admitted that he is considering retirement as he approaches his 40th birthday. Klitschko says: 'I do have to start thinking about retirement.' But then the Ukrainian who boxes mostly to sell-out crowds in German football stadia, adds: 'I would like to fight Fury, which would be a huge event in Europe. 'I want to fight Wilder, to add the only remaining belt to my unified world titles.' Unusually, both men would present Klitschko with opposition as tall or, in Fury's case, even taller than his own 6ft 6in. Fury is his mandatory challenger for the WBO title. Wilder holds the WBC title which was vacated by Klitschko's brother Vitali when he retired to concentrate on the violent complexities of Ukrainian politics as Mayor of Kiev. WBC heavyweight champions Deontay Wilder looks set to face\u00a0Klitschko before he hangs up his gloves. Wladimir is also the WBA, IBF, IBO and Ring magazine champion. There is another factor which will tempt him to prolong his reign even further. Currently he ranks fourth in the all-time list of successive world heavyweight title defences, with 18. Victories over Jennings \u2013 which looks to be something of a formality in New York's Madison Square Garden, would lift him level with Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes on 19. If he adds wins over Fury and Wilder he will close to within just four victories of the 25-defences record held by Joe Louis. That is likely to be an opportunity too good to refuse. Tyson Fury, pictured in action against Dereck Chisora, is Klitschko's mandatory challenger for the WBO title. The crushing defeat of Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr by the largely unheralded and, in terms of his first name, unpronounceable Pole Andrzej Fonfara, complicates Carl Froch's exit strategy from the ring. One of Froch's two dream scenarios has been a farewell fight in Las Vegas, probably against Chavez with his box office appeal for America's Hispanic population and fans south of the border in Mexico. But the namesake son of an idolised father was so badly beaten up through nine rounds in California by Fonfara \u2013 suffering the first knock down of his career in the process \u2013 that he quit on his stool. Carl Froch could choose to retire after\u00a0Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr's defeat by\u00a0Andrzej Fonfara last week. Inadvisedly, Chavez had agreed to a catch-weight fight with light-heavyweight contender Fonfara and is talking about going back down to Froch's super-middleweight division. Whether this former middleweight champion would still be a draw after this setback is doubtful and Froch had said before the fight that it would hurt his plans 'if Chavez got knocked out. The other swansong ambition \u2013 to fight on the City Ground of his beloved Nottingham Forest \u2013 suffered a setback when Andre Ward agreed to come to England for their mandatory WBA title unifier but not to Froch's home town. Retirement is becoming an increasingly attractive option for the Cobra.

{"document":"What would you do if a complete stranger asked you for $100, or offered you an apple in a parking lot without explanation? These are only two of the 100 challenges Chinese-born, American-based Jia Jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about \"100 Days of Rejection\", a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30, just weeks before his first child was born. After his tech start-up was declined investment, Jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head-on. This led to his writing his book called Rejection Proof, part self-help and part motivational\/autobiography, which is being released this week. Famously, in 2012 on his third day of the project, Jiang asked Austin, Texas, Krispy Kreme manager (Jackie Braun) to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the Olympic symbol. To his surprise, she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered. He shared his video and it went viral on Reddit. Before long, Jiang (and Braun) were invited on talk shows and Jiang was being asked to speak at events across the US. Jiang was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew. That wasn't the goal of the project though. \"I'm really just a person trying to overcome my own fears,\" explained Jiang. The project started out to help \"fix my own problems, and now I'm helping others fix theirs,\" he said. \"The fear of rejection really holds people back. I'm trying to demystify the idea of rejection.\" Jiang, who as a child dreamed of being Bill Gates and has been viewed 7 million times on YouTube, has found his entrepreneurial dream in a different role for the moment. \"My goal is to turn rejection into opportunity. I always thought it was something to run away from, but if we can embrace it, we can turn it into a lot more than an obstacle.\" 8 top tips in making rejection work for you:. 1 - The fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection. By putting ourselves out there, the world will usually open itself up to you. Though the world can seem cruel and cold, actually humans have a hard time saying no. So open yourself up, don't be afraid to ask for something. If you fail, remember it's not about you. 2 -  Rejection is more or less a numbers game. Sometimes the most far-fetched idea gets a yes. If you talk to enough people, somebody will say yes to you. J.K. Rowling went through 12 rejections to get her yes for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. 3 - You cannot use rejection to measure the merit of an idea. Sometimes if you really want to change the world, getting rejection is a must. Rejection is a human interaction with two sides. It often says more about the rejector than the rejectee, and should never be used as the universal truth and sole judgment of merit. 4 - Don't run away after a no. The most common thing we do when we're rejected is we want to run because rejection is painful - you're hurt, angry and you lose confidence. But actually if we know how to handle it, we can often minimize the chance of rejection. Be confident, engaging, collaborate. I used all of these traits to maximise getting a yes. 5 - Ask why? When you get rejected you have to find out why. Then spend time to find solutions to solve that why. Sometimes through this process you learn there is something else you can ask for. Ask for an intermediate position rather than the top position. 6 - Set a number of how many no's you can take. In his book, Jiang helps his wife set out to get her dream job at Google. He tells her that instead of thinking about getting a job, she needs to prepare herself for how many no's she can take.  In the end, she was offered a job at Google. 7 - Be invincible. By the end of his project, Jiang said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection. It was a gradual process - gradually my comfort zone expanded. It's like a muscle, I could become stronger and stronger. 8 - Stand tall and remember rejection is an opinion. People are who they are. A lot of people will reject you because of their mood, their education, their upbringing, and you can't change who they are. But you can stand confidently. Innate confidence comes across.

It's the fear of rejection, more than rejection itself, which holds us back.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Jia Jiang, a Chinese-born, American-based entrepreneur, tested himself by embarking on 100 days of challenges to overcome his fear of rejection.

Jiang's viral video, in which he asked an Austin, Texas Krispy Kreme manager (Jackie Braun) to make him a donut Olympic symbol, led Jiang to unexpected success. Jiang's book, Rejection Proof, is part-autobiography and part self-help, and introduces ways to overcome the fear of rejection in life. Surprisingly, Jia Jiang learned from his experience that it is not the rejection that hurts but rather the fear of it."}
{"document":"A mother who cradled her three-year-old son while she lay down in front of a train killed them both after finding out her husband had a second family in Egypt, an inquest has heard. Depressed Donna Oettinger, 41, had sought urgent psychiatric help in the months before she and her son Zaki died on train tracks in south London in March 2013, Croydon Coroner's Court heard. She had attempted to kill herself three months before the tragedy but was unable to receive the treatment recommended to her by doctors. Depressed Donna Oettinger, 41, had sought urgent psychiatric help in the months before she and her son Zaki died on train tracks in south London in March 2013, Croydon Coroner's Court heard. \u00a0Ms Oettinger had starting suffering depression after going to Zaki's father, Mohammed El Shaer, in Egypt, and discovering he had another family, an inquest heard. Her mental health had declined after discovering Zaki's father, an Egyptian national who could not travel to the UK, had a second family. She also was using cocaine regularly for six months and became convinced she had caused lasting damage and her anxiety worsened, the inquest heard. After visiting a psychiatrist in November Zaki was referred to social services, although the case was not reviewed. It meant the family and Zaki's safety was never assessed by the authority. A coroner has today ruled that doctors and social services in charge of looking after Ms Oettinger, made five 'significant' failures in the months before she and her young son lay in the path of a train in March 2012. But at the end of a three day inquest into their deaths, coroner Selena Lynch\u00a0said that despite the family slipping under social services' radar 'nothing could have be done' to foresee the deaths. A coroner has ruled that doctors and social services in charge of looking after Ms Oettinger, made five 'significant' failures. But at the end of a three day inquest into their deaths, coroner Selena Lynch said that despite the family slipping under social services' radar 'nothing could have be done' to foresee the deaths. Ms Lynch concluded at the end of a three-day inquest that Ms Oettinger, who suffered chronic anxiety, unlawfully killed her son. She said: 'Donna Oettinger suffered from depression and had suicidal ideas. 'She had taken a significant overdose and had been seen by a number of professionals. 'The failures that I have identified, are in some respects quite significant, but can't be said to have caused or contributed to her death or Zaki's.' She said some of the measures now in place might have made a difference, but added: 'I think it is unlikely that Donna Oettinger would have been admitted to hospital or prevented from being alone with her child. 'Whether there might have been some improvement in her condition it is impossible to say.' The Coroner identified five separate failures by doctors and nurses at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and Croydon child protection services, who first came into contact with Ms Oettinger in late 2012. Her mental health had declined after discovering Zaki's father, an Egyptian national who could not travel to the UK, had a second family. She also was using cocaine regularly for six months and became convinced she had caused lasting damage and her anxiety worsened, the inquest heard. Ms Oettinger took an overdose of tablets while visiting a friend in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, on December 13 2012. A social worker in Rotherham advised doctors back in Croydon that she should be cared for by a Home Treatment Team (HTT) However the request was not met. After a follow up appointment back in London a few days later no-one liaised with Rotherham and Ms Oettinger was not reassessed. Doctors decided that instead of treating her at home she would benefit from her own 'care coordinator'. But a miscommunication meant this never happened. As a result the Trust failed to check on Ms Oettinger's condition when she missed a number of appointments in early 2013. The pair died around a month after her last missed appointment. Zaki's grandmother, Carol Oettinger, wept as the the Coroner recorded her daughter's death as suicide and the unlawful killing of Zaki. The coroner said: 'With respect to Donna Oettinger the only appropriate conclusion in this case is a matter of law I conclude to be one of suicide.' With respect to Zaki, she said:\u00a0'His mother was suffering from an anxiety disorder. The conclusion for Zaki, again as a matter of law, must be one of unlawful killing.' At the end of the hearing the Coroner pleaded that the horrific nature of Zaki's death and its link to Ms Oettinger's health didn't undo work to end stigma around mental illness. She said: 'It's important to recognise what happened to Donna and Zaki is very much out of the ordinary. '[But] I fear that the stigma of depression and mental illness will grow as a result of events such as these. 'The circumstances of these deaths are extremely upsetting, even for the experienced professionals who dealt with the events of March 22 2013. 'But they represent a tiny fraction of Donna and Zaki's lives. The mother and baby were seen lying on the tracks at a south London station, before their deaths. 'Zaki was a happy child who was very much loved by all those around him and wouldn't have had any time at all to understand what happened to him. 'The events that day do not define them as people. 'Don't let anyone tell you that suicide can always be prevented. They are wrong. Zaki and Donna deserve to be remembered as they were in happier and healthier times.' Speaking after the hearing,\u00a0Bridget Hughes, Solicitor to the Oettinger family at Kingsley Napley LLP said: 'The Oettinger family is devastated by the loss of Donna and dear Zaki. No one could have fought harder than Donna's mother, Carol, to try and get the care her daughter desperately needed when she became ill. 'The Coroner has heard that there were serious shortcomings in care at the Croydon Mood Anxiety and Personality Disorder Team (MAP) which was managed by the South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. 'These shortcomings permeated through from community psychiatric nurse to consultant level. The service, fragmented in design, was chaotic in its implementation. 'In the family's view, this contributed to Donna's deepening despair and distress. 'Nothing will bring Donna and Zaki Oettinger back, but it is hoped that something may be learned from this family's experiences given the detailed investigation that has since taken place.'\n","right_summary":"Donna and Zaki Oettinger died on train tracks in south London in 2013.

{"document":"Sometimes, putting up a billboard just isn't quite enough - so a group of Russian entrepreneurs have come up with a new way to get you message out: on the breasts of a beautiful woman. Companies Tittygram and Titisign have popped up in Russia offering the eyebrow raising service and are, by all accounts, causing quite a stir. Indeed, it has already caught the attention of one big company, which jumped at the chance to advertise its whoppers. Cleavage: Burger King has become one of the first big companies to take advantage of thi type of advertising. From the heart of Russia: Two companies now offer to write on a woman's cleavage and take a snap. Burger King's Russian branch posted a picture of a woman with 'I love Burger King' emblazoned across her chest, courtesy of Tittygram, on its VK page, the country's version of Facebook. The message above reads: 'Do you want your name to be written here? 'Every week the most active participant will get such a named postcard from us! 'Not only our whoppers are prepared on fire, everything we have is on fire as well!' And it has certainly brought them a fair amount of attention, with hundreds of 'likes' and countless comments - although they are not all positive. What's more, as advertising campaigns go, it is incredibly cheap: for as little as $6, or \u00a34, they promise to get your message across in a way which is certain to grab attention. Versatile: The picture can then be used as either a personal message, or advertising, and cost just \u00a34. Eyebrow raising: But the use of a woman's cleavage as advertising space has not been universally popular. According to the Global Post, Tittygram was set up earlier this year, with Titisign following in its footsteps more recently. Both offer a similar service, asking people to send their messages in, at which point a model writes the message on her breasts and then takes the requisite photo. The English website for Titisign boasts: 'Stave off boredom! Send your communication on the bosom of Russian beauties \u2013 knock your friends\u2019 socks off, advertise your business and make unforgettable gifts! 'Say hello from the heart of Russia!' Boasts: 'Knock your friends\u2019 socks off, advertise your business and make unforgettable gifts,' says Titisign. Alexey Gavrilov, co-founder of Titisign, revealed to MailOnline the company gets a range of requests for messages - from 'Farewell, Semyonych. With best wishes for your wedding day' to 'Do not play with heart - it is one. Play with boobs - there are two of them'. The women, he reveals, are not all professional models. 'We invite not only professional models who are interested in our project and like our idea, but beautiful girls,' he explained. 'Some of our models we find in professional community - we have photographers in our team - and some of them we find through social networks, others find us themselves.' However, as one VK user points out, when advertising 'it is necessary find something that is interesting to everyone' - and this certainly is not.\n","right_summary":"Two Russian companies have started offering unusual service this year.

{"document":"If the Borussia Dortmund players had been shocked by Wednesday's news that manager Jurgen Klopp will quit the club at the end of the season, they showed no sign that it had affected them on Saturday. Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Shinji Kagawa were on target as Dortmund returned to winning ways with a comfortable victory against relegation-threatened Paderborn at Signal Iduna Park. The win moved last season's Bundesliga runners-up to eighth in the table and leaves them with a realistic chance of qualifying for Europe, which would be a remarkable achievement for a club that was flirting with relegation themselves earlier in the year. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang makes it 2-0 to Dortmund as the home side cruised to victory against Paderborn. Aubameyang celebrates with his trademark front flip after doubling the home side's lead. Gabon international\u00a0Aubameyang wheels away in celebration after giving Dortmund a two-goal cushion. Borussia Dortmund (4-2-3-1): Weidenfeller; Durm, Sokratis, Hummels, Schmelzer (Dudziak 82); Gundogan, Ginter; Blaszczykowski (Kampl 75), Kagawa, Mkhitaryan; Aubameyang (Immobile 85) Subs not used: Jojic, Ramos, Langerak, Narey,. Scorer(s):\u00a0Mkhitaryan 48, Aubameyang 55, Kagawa 80. Booked: Hummels. Manager: Jurgen Klopp. Paderborn (4-4-2): Kruse; Heinloth, Rafa, Hunemeier (Ziegler 82), Hartherz; Koc, Vrancic, Bakalorz, Ouali (Rupp 57); Lakic (Vucinovic 72), Kachunga. Subs not used: Kutschke, Strohdiek, Bruckner, Luck. Manager:\u00a0Andr\u00e9 Breitenreiter. Referee: F Brych. Much of the pre-amble to this fixture understandably centred on Klopp's surprise announcement - coming at a press conference on Wednesday - but Dortmund are slowly creeping back up the table and with victory here moved to within three points of sixth-place Augsburg. Dortmund had lost their two previous Bundesliga matches against Borrusia Monchengladbach and Bayern Munich and, after being held by the visitors for the opening 45 minutes, cruised to victory with plenty to spare. After a frustrating opening 45 the hosts had to wait just three minutes after the interval before taking the lead.\u00a0Aubameyang delivered a perfect cross from theright and Armenia international\u00a0Mkhitaryan powered a near post header past\u00a0Lukas Kruse. Dortmund, clearly wary of their poor defensive record this season, continued to press and increased their advantage just eight minutes later when Aubameyang got his name on the scoresheet after providing the first. The win came three days after manager Jurgen Klopp announced he will quit the club in the summer. A Borussia Dortmund fan holds up a sign thanking Klopp for his achievements in the last seven years. The home crowd paid tribute to their soon-to-be departing manager who twice led them to Bundesliga glory. The Gabon striker calmly finished over the on-rushing Kruse after the ball broke for him in the penalty following Paderborn's failure to deal with a cross. The visitors stunned Klopp's side by coming from two down in the reverse fixture earlier this season to earn a point, but there was to be no repeat this time around. Former Manchester United midfielder Kagawa made absolutely sure of that when he latched on to Mkhitaryan's ball with 10 minutes to play before escaping a challenge and firing past Kruse to complete a routine win. Henrikh Mkhitaryan heads the home side in front just three minutes after half-time at Signal Iduna Park. Paderborn goalkeeper Lukas Kruse fails to keep\u00a0Mkhitaryan's header out at his near post.

Belgian attacker Mirallas was one of Everton\u2019s top performers in the first half of the campaign. \u2018I know there have been a couple of times he's had quotes translated from interviews. I don't think anything he has said is disrespectful or out of the norm. The way I see it he's one of those players who loves playing football and he hasn't got any other motivation. \u2018He still has a two year contract. If he were out of contract, I would be worried, but all I want is for him to be fully recovered.\u2019 Mirallas has made no secret of his ambition to play in the Champions League.

{"document":"Everton manager Roberto Martinez has not ruled out the prospect of Antolin Alcaraz or Sylvain Distin earning new contracts but stressed they need to prove they can still be important figures in the club's future. Both centre-backs' current deals expire this summer and it seems highly unlikely Distin, who is 38 in December and has played more for the under-21s in the last month than he has the first team, will be retained. Alcaraz, 33 in July, has more of a chance of securing a short-term extension as Martinez looks to strengthen and restructure his defence in the summer. Roberto Martinez insists 37-year-old defender Sylvain Distin still has time to prove he deserves a new deal. Antolin Alcaraz, who joined Everton from Wigan where he played under Martinez, could get a new deal. While the Toffees boss is keen to advance the talents of younger players - Tyias Browning and Brendan Galloway the two most likely to benefit - he has not ruled out retaining existing senior players. 'There are only two players out of contract and we have two loan players (Aaron Lennon and Christian Atsu) and those decisions will be made when we have finished the season,' said Martinez. 'The next six games could have a massive bearing on that. Ninety minutes is a big opportunity to change people's views. 'All individuals will be judged over that period. In football it does not matter if you have a contract or not, you always need to improve and show the right attitude and show you are ready to be part of the future of the club. 'But when you get players at the end of their contract there are decisions to be made and it is not just the club, it is the player as well.' Roberto Martinez says his club's recruitment team have been searching for targets for six months. Distin has played more for Everton's youth team than the first XI in the past month, and could be on his way. Martinez said they have established a list of transfer targets for the summer and, while he would not confirm publicly, Aston Villa's on-loan Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley, out of contract at the end of the season, is believed to be one of them. 'The recruitment department has been working really hard over the last six months and we need to assemble a really strong squad,' Martinez said. 'First and foremost it is an opportunity for young players to show they are ready for big important roles for next campaign and everyone else providing strong competition to be important figures for the future. Tom Cleverley, who is on loan at Aston Villa, is a target, with Martinez having worked with him before. 'The dressing room is very strong as it is now, so we need to make sure whatever we do in the summer is to get us in a better place. 'We know the situation with Tom. He is a player that I know well having worked with him (in a previous loan spell at Wigan) - and that's it. 'Tom is a player that is at the moment fighting for something very important for his club and that deserves respect. 'I wouldn't expect anyone to speak about my players and I would never do that.'\n","right_summary":"Antolin Alcaraz and Sylvain Distin are out of contract in the summer.

Criticism followed initial speculation about Khan\u2019s opponent but he has hit back now by declaring Algieri a much more significant challenge than Gavin.

{"document":"Probe: Guernsey police sent ten officers to the island last Thursday to raid Dr Rory Lyon's surgery and a private address. The widow of one of four patients whose deaths are being investigated on the Channel Islands last night spoke out to defend the GP at the centre of the police probe. Yvonne Deegan, 77, described the investigation as 'absolutely diabolical' and said she was 'perfectly happy' with the care provided by Dr Rory Lyons. Her husband Bernie Deegan, 70, died suddenly earlier this year following a 12-year cancer battle. Police last week told Mrs Deegan that his death is one of four on the small island of Alderney being investigated as part of a probe into Dr Lyons. The retired stonemason was a close friend of Colin Cosheril, 63, whose sudden death from heart failure last year is being also being looked at. Islanders have said it was concerns over the unexpected death of Mr Cosheril's cousin Karen from pneumonia in January that prompted the investigation in to Dr Lyons, 62, who has been suspended from practicing. But Mrs Deegan, 77, yesterday said she had no complaints over Dr Lyons or the care he gave her sick husband Bernie. She said her husband's death was sudden but not unexpected as he had been ill since he was diagnosed with throat cancer 12 years ago. The great-grandmother said: 'Only God could have helped him. 'I have always been perfectly happy with Dr Lyons and whatever is going on I think it is absolutely diabolical. 'I don't know who started all this but I think they are all very wrong.' Guernsey police sent ten officers to the island last Thursday to raid Dr Lyon's surgery and a private address. The Eagle Medical Practice was searched for five hours and computers and papers \u2013 including medical records \u2013 were seized by police. Mrs Deegan said she did not know why her husband's death was being looked at and police had not given her any information either. The cancer had recently spread to Mr Deegan's chest and specialists in Guernsey had warned the family he did not have long left before he died in January. She said: 'The police are not saying anything. They are telling us not to talk to anyone but they are not telling us anything.' But she said she had no reason to be concerned about how her husband died, adding: 'As far as I'm concerned there should be no reason. They gave him a death sentence 10 years ago. 'I don't really know and I can't really understand it and actually I'm very, very sad about it. 'The police said Dr Lyons was being looked into and Bernie's death had come up and I said well I didn't see why. 'He has been cremated so at least they can't dig him up. Thank God. Because that I wouldn't have.' Relatives:\u00a0Cousins Karen and Colin Cosheril were patients of the Alderney family doctor when they died. Karen, 52, left, died in January of pneumonia and Colin, 63, right, died of heart failure in May last year. The widow said her husband's death was sudden, but said: 'It was in the sense of the word sudden but we knew it was going to happen because the lung specialist in Guernsey told us.' Mr Cosheril's sister Brenda Webb reported his sudden death to the health authorities last year and was told last week it was being investigated as part of the police probe.

{"document":"President Barack Obama took a break from being the real president on April Fools' Day to impersonate a fictional one, House of Cards' conniving Frank Underwood. 'Hello everybody. This is not Frank Underwood,' the president said after turning his head Underwood, who is played by Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey and frequently speaks Shakespearean-style monologues to the audience. 'This is Barack Obama. Happy April Fools' Day. Frank learned it from me,' he said. Scroll down for video. President Barack Obama impersonated House of Cards's fictional president Frank Underwood by dipping into a southern drawl. Obama attempted to copy the deep voice and South Carolina accent of the fictional Commander-in-Chief, who is known for scheming his way into the nation's highest office through deceit and violence. The real president slipped into his normal voice by the end of 12-second impersonation. He has previously admitted to watching the Netflix show, though he says that life in Washington is not as dramatic as portrayed by Kevin Spacey and others. 'I wish things were that ruthlessly efficient,' he said in 2013. The short clip in front of a portrait of Abraham Lincoln begins with a statement of the time and date, a commonly used scene entry device in House of Cards. Underwood, portrayed in the Netflix series by Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey, frequently speaks in asides to the camera as he crafts his political machinations. Obama was also asked to cameo on the show by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, according to Deadline. His April Fools' joke was filmed as part of the West Wing Week YouTube series, which chronicled the presidents' week. The clip for this week also included outtakes from the five previous years of Obama's presidency, which featured the president making funny faces and practicing speeches. On Thursday House of Cards was renewed for a fourth season.\n","right_summary":"President spoke to the camera for 12 seconds, beginning in southern drawl.

{"document":"A sure sign of middle age is when you start to get nostalgic about the mobile phones of your youth. OK, those early models couldn\u2019t do much compared with today\u2019s smartphones. They couldn\u2019t surf the internet, take pictures, play music or make you a cup of tea. But what they did have was a battery that lasted more than a few hours before the phone went dead. Scroll down for video. Modern life: According to a recent poll, nine out of ten people feel stressed if their phone battery run out. There\u2019s even a word for it \u2014 \u2018nomophobia\u2019, the fear of being without a working mobile. My favourite phone of all time was a sleek silver Nokia 6310i from the early 2000s, which is still sitting in a drawer at home. It may be primitive by today\u2019s standards, but it could run for 17 days on a single charge. Compare that with the battery life of a modern iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. Make a few calls, send a few emails, listen to some music and you\u2019ll be out of juice by teatime. This week it was revealed that Sir James Dyson, inventor of Dyson hoovers, is attempting to solve the problem by investing \u00a310 million in U.S.-based battery experts Sakti3. The 67-year-old entrepreneur is supporting the company as it attempts to double the battery life of our phones, electric cars and vacuums. Separately, scientists at Stanford University are hoping that their newly invented aluminium battery will revolutionise the industry with its ability to fully charge in under a minute. The battery will keep going for seven times as long as its lithium-ion relative, and can apparently withstand 7,500 recharges, whereas a conventional battery can take only 1,000. In the tech world, the battle for better battery life is never-ending. Earlier this month, Apple was left red-faced when it was revealed how quickly its new iWatch \u2014 which costs up to \u00a312,000 \u2014 ran out of power. Sir James Dyson, pictured, inventor of Dyson hoovers, is attempting to solve the problem by investing \u00a310 million in  battery experts Sakti3. At the launch, Apple chief executive Tim Cook boasted that the device had a battery life of 18 hours. But it later emerged that using the smartwatch for phone calls or apps means it will die after three hours. According to a recent poll, nine out of ten people feel stressed if their phone battery run out. There\u2019s even a word for it \u2014 \u2018nomophobia\u2019, the fear of being without a working mobile. And increasingly, phones come with built-in batteries that are almost impossible to remove without a degree in electronics. Apple started the ball rolling with the iPhone, and this month Samsung announced its latest model \u2014 the S6 \u2014 would have built-in batteries. So is there anything we can do to get more juice out of our phones? Nigel Linge, professor of telecommunications at Salford University, says the problem isn\u2019t the batteries, which have improved immeasurably over the past couple of decades. \u2018The reason why batteries lasted seven days in the 1990s is that a phone back then didn\u2019t do a great deal,\u2019 says Professor Linge. \u2018It had a monochrome screen, made phone calls and sent the occasional text. It didn\u2019t have apps, GPS, Bluetooth or wi-fi and it wasn\u2019t used for Facebook. \u2018If you take a modern phone and turn off all those things and just use it for phone calls and text messages, it will last a lot longer.\u2019 The first mobile phone batteries were bulky, heavy and made with nickel cadium. They also lost battery life over time if they were not run down fully between charges, known as the \u2018memory effect\u2019. In the 1990s those early batteries were replaced by a superior version \u2014 nickel metal hydride. These didn\u2019t suffer as badly from the memory effect, were thinner and quicker to charge. Today\u2019s phones use lithium-ion batteries, an even thinner, lighter and even longer-lasting variety. How long they last depends what you do with them. Caught out: Early mobile models couldn't surf the internet, take pictures, play music or make you a cup of tea. But what they did have was a battery that lasted more than a few hours before the phone went dead. \u2018One of the big drains is the screen \u2014 if people have the brightness turned up, it will run down the battery,\u2019 says Professor Linge. \u2018The other drain is the phone signal.\u2019 If you are in a low signal area, your battery will drain more quickly because the phone has to work harder to stay in contact with the nearest phone mast. Phones also use up more of the battery if they are indoors, where signals are weaker. But Sunetra Chakravarti, from Mobile Choice Magazine, says there are simple things everyone can do to extend their phone\u2019s life between charges. Turning off Bluetooth \u2014 the wireless system used by phones to connect to printers, laptops and other computers \u2014 will save your battery from running down. Switching off location services which use the phone\u2019s built-in GPS tracker can also save power, as can turning down the volume of the ring tone and silencing any bleeps and clicks when you press buttons on the phone. \u2018And make sure you have turned off any apps that are running in the background,\u2019 she says. Keeping phones cool is also crucial: they work best below 30c (86f). So leaving them in the sun, or sleeping with the phone so it gets warm, will run it down faster. However, unlike the older style batteries, you don\u2019t need to discharge modern ones fully before you top them up. Charging overnight shouldn\u2019t cause problems, as modern phones and batteries have switches that stop the charging when they are full. Another way to get more out of a battery is to download the latest version of the phone\u2019s operating system. Newer versions of the software used for Apple iPhones, for instance, let owners stop apps from constantly updating themselves with new information when they are not being used. Even then, you\u2019ll still find major variations between different phones. That\u2019s because some models are more efficient at making calls, surfing the internet or playing videos than others. When technology consumer website Expert Reviews tested the battery life of different smartphones, it found that the best lasted an amazing 14 hours longer than the worst. The Sony Xperia Z3 Compact kept playing a movie on a loop for more than 20 hours on one charge before it went dead \u2014 while the Nokia Lumia 620 managed just six hours and the iPhone 6 lasted just under 13 hours. Apple was left red-faced when it was revealed how quickly its new iWatch (pictured) ran out of power. It emerged that using the smartwatch for phone calls or apps means it will die after three hours. Other tests have found that the Xperia Z3 lasts on average 48 hours when used for five hours a day to stream music, make calls and watch videos. You may still need to replace a battery; a typical one will start to lose its ability to recharge after three or four years. But replacing batteries is becoming more and more difficult. Manufacturers are increasingly building batteries into phones so that owners can\u2019t remove them. You can send your iPhone off to Apple to get the battery replaced, though it will take a week and cost \u00a359 plus postage. And it is possible to do it yourself with a screwdriver and a replacement iPhone battery \u2014 available for around \u00a315 on eBay. But it\u2019s fairly tricky to pull off and easy to damage the phone. Some mobile repair shops will also replace batteries \u2014 and charge a lot less than Apple. The bright spot on the horizon is that it will soon take less time to charge up a phone. \u2018Almost every manufacturer is bringing in faster charging, so with 15 minutes of charging you get four hours of talk time,\u2019 says Sunetra Chakravarti. Sales of portable chargers are also booming. These slim boxes have to be charged in advance but are small enough to fit in a pocket. If your phone is running low, the charger tops up the battery. But until battery life catches up with the demands of modern phones, millions of mobile users will spend their life plugging in their phone to charge.\n","right_summary":"Most modern phone models have batteries that only last a couple of hours.

{"document":"Two teenage boys reportedly stabbed a third to death after arguing about their mobile phones - then killed four girl pals they were with so they couldn't tell police about the murder. Sergey Burkaev, 16, and Konstantin Surkov, 17, are said to have raped their last victim before slitting her throat. The vodka-fuelled duo doused all five bodies in petrol and set them alight at a flat in south-west Russia, according to prosecutors. Scroll down for video. Accused of murder and rape:\u00a0Sergey Burkaev, 16 (left) and Konstantin Surkov, 17, could be jailed for life. Slain at a party: Russian police released pixellated images of some of the victims, who were aged 16 to 22. The baby-faced pair apparently fled in a stolen car but were arrested by traffic officers, who saw the vehicle being driven erratically. If convicted, Surkov and Burkaev face life in jail. The police who quizzed them say both teenagers have confessed to the murders and rape. The only reason they have given for the carnage was that they were drunk, the officers added. The horrific crimes reportedly took place at a house party in the small town of Kumertau in Bashkortostan on Friday night. A friend of party-goers - 17-year-old Svetlana Frolova - said: 'I just can't believe this has happened. They were all so friendly with each other and always hanging out together. 'I had been invited (to the party) too, and had really wanted to go, but my mum said I had to stay in to do my homework. I'm so glad I did. I can't understand why they did this.' Arrested: One of the youths is told to lean face down on a police car after being stopped in a 'stolen' vehicle. Boozed-up Surkov and Burkaev are said to have accused fellow party guest Sidor Fokine, 22, of stealing their mobile phones. When he denied it, they flew into a rage and pulled out their knives. Then they knifed him in front of the other guests - who were all female. But they feared that the young women would identify them as the killers. So they knifed them too, including 16-year-old Maria Sorokina, in whose flat they were partying, and her 17-year-old friend Anastasia Selezneva. Scene of carnage: Police officers at the apartment block in\u00a0Kumertau where five young people were killed. The other victims were aged 21 and 22. Anastasia was the last to be murdered - and she was raped before her brutal death.\u00a0The five bodies were set on fire in the apartment.

{"document":"It's probable that Thiago Alcantara would never have signed for Manchester United even if David Moyes had wanted him. Once Pep Guardiola had made it clear he required the midfelder at Bayern Munich, it was pointless for United to continue their pursuit anyway,. But the fact that Moyes wasn't keen on the transfer - 'not his type' said a club source - was probably an early indication that he wasn't the right fit for United. Not that Moyes is a bad judge of a player; all managers get it wrong at some point. However, United's need for passing quality from deep midfield was apparent throughout Moyes' short time at the club. Indeed, it has continued to be a problem until Michael Carrick fully recovered from injury and Ander Herrera began to find his feet. The kind of passing display Thiago delivered in Bayern's 6-1 win over Porto on Wednesday has been precisely what United have been missing. Thiago (right) heads in Bayern Munich's first goal during their 6-1 win over Porto on Tuesday night. Thiago blows a kiss to the crowd as he celebrates his goal which started Bayern's remarkable comeback. Thiago is congratulated on his strike by Pep Guardiola, the man who took him from Barcelona to Bayern. Without quality in that area, few teams can compete at the elite level any more. It used to be the case that a requirement of playing holding midfield was height, strength and an ability to tackle. Given that most distribution emanates from deep, being among the best passers of the ball in that position is infinitely more important now. Moyes might quite reasonably been worried that Thiago was on the slight side to thrive in the rough and tumble of the Premier League. And his troubles with repeated knee ligaments injuries until his comeback this year add some weight to that theory - he was much missed by Spain at the World Cup after pulling out with a knee injury. But there are few players in the world who can pass like Thiago. Gary Neville has spoken about how Paul Scholes was once among that small group of players who could dictate a game simply with the tempo and the accuracy of their passing. Andrea Pirlo and Xavi are two more from Scholes' generation. Thiago is now elevating himself to their level. One experienced German journalist who has been watching Bayern for 35 years commented last night: 'Thiago might well be the most technically-gifted central midfielder who has ever played for Bayern.' Thiago dictated the pace of the game from deep for Bayern Munich as they crushed Porto. Thiago started his career at Barcelona but was overlooked for Cesc Fabregas (right) by boss Tito Vilanova. And no-one has invested more in Thiago than Guardiola, which is why United had no realistic chance of signing him once his offer had been made. It was Pep who promoted him to the first team at Barcelona in 2009 and made him an integral part of the squad. But when Pep left, his successor, the late Tito Vilanova, wanted Cesc Fabregas to play that role. Thiago was sidelined, hence his availability in the summer of 2013. He is very much a global footballer for the 21st century. His dad, of course, is Brazilian, the World Cup winner Mazinho; Thiago was born in Italy and raised in Spain. He opted to play for the country in which he was living, rather than that of his forefathers or his birth, and was outstanding for Spain in the European Under 21 championships in 2013, scoring a hat-trick in the final against Italy in a 4-2 win. At Barcelona they are said not to be disturbed by the rise of Thiago. Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets have that position covered. But Xavi is off to Qatar and Cesc is at Chelsea. Should Barca end up against Bayern in the Champions League semi finals, they may yet rue the day they deemed him surplus to requirements. David Moyes believed Thiago may not be able to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League.\n","right_summary":"Thiago Alcantara scored Bayern Munich's first goal in 6-1 win over Porto.

Manchester United made an ultimately fruitless effort to sign the midfielder.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Manchester United missed out on signing Thiago Alcantara due to David Moyes dismissing him as not physically capable of playing in the Premier League, despite his impressive passing skills. Thiago proved Moyes wrong by scoring the first goal for Bayern Munich in their 6-1 win over Porto. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola recognized Thiago's talent and personally brought him over from Barcelona. Thiago's Brazilian heritage adds to his global appeal, and he even scored a hat-trick for Spain in the European Under 21 championship final against Italy. Despite Barcelona having Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets in Thiago's position, they may regret letting him go if they face off against Bayern Munich in the Champions League semi-finals."}

In Madagascar, lemurs are one of the most at risk species, as are shrew tenrecs. There are 105 recognised species of lemur, of which 24 are critically endangered, 49 are endangered, 20 are vulnerable and three are near-threatened. In Mexico, the loss of habitat as a result of agriculture and fishing has already driven many species close to extinction. For example, vaquita is the world\u2019s rarest marine mammal. The small porpoise wasn't discovered until 1958 but there are now said to be fewer than 100 in the wild. In Brazil there are 82 endangered mammals. Experts from Lancaster University recently surveyed households in the cities of Borba and Novo Aripuan\u00e3 to find out which animals they hunt and eat from the rainforest. The UK has five endangered mammals, but these are almost exclusively marine mammals such as seals and whales that have come under threat from over fishing, including the blue whale, the fin whale, the sei whale and the North Atlantic right whale. Despite only occupying 1% of the Earth's land mass, Indonesia's rainforests are home to 12% of mammal species in the world. These include the Sumatran Rhinoceros, the Talaud Fruit Bat and the Sea Otter. Indonesia sits at the top of the list because deforestation in the region is leaving many species at risk including orangutans and critically endangered Sumatran tigers (pictured) and rhinos. They found that virtually all of the 153 households - 99 per cent - eat fish found in the jungle at least once a month, while 79 per cent eat bushmeat made up of both mammals and birds. Nearly half of the households surveyed - 48 per cent - said they eat turtles and tortoises, with 28 per cent feasting on caimans. And some of the species being eaten are classed as endangered, vulnerable and threatened. Madagascar is second on the list with 114 endangered mammals, with threats particularly facing lemurs and the region's shrew tenrecs. This compares to 38 in Cameroon and 24 in South Africa. There are 105 recognised species of lemur (ruffed lemur pictured), of which 24 are critically endangered, 49 are endangered, 20 are vulnerable and three are near-threatened. These include a type of forest pig called the white-lipped peccary, which despite being \u2018near threatened\u2019 was eaten by 19 per cent of those surveyed.

{"document":"Hillary Clinton's campaign-in-waiting met on Saturday in its Brooklyn headquarters, a day before the former secretary of state officially announces her campaign for president, according to a Democrat who attended the meeting. Robby Mook, Clinton's soon-to-be campaign manager, distributed a \"values statement\" at the meeting that outlined what the campaign will stand for, what their goals are and how they plan to win -- something Clinton failed to do in 2008. The campaign's purpose, the document states, is \"to give every family, every small business, and every American a path to lasting prosperity by electing Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States.\" The document makes clear that the campaign will try to avoid mistakes that plagued Clinton's failed 2008 run. Many of the \"guiding principles\" in the memo mention issues that sunk Clinton's first campaign. The document, according to the source, includes the ideas from Mook, along with a wide array of Clinton's soon-to-be staffers and advisers. The memo maintains that the campaign must remain humble, disciplined and united, something voters in Iowa and others states have said Clinton did not do in 2008. \"This campaign is not about Hillary Clinton and not about us,\" reads the document that was obtained by CNN. In the section about the campaign's guiding principles, the document reads, \"We are humble: We take nothing for granted, we are never afraid to lose, we always outcompete and fight for every vote we can win. We know this campaign will be won on the ground, in states.\" It also calls on campaign staffers to remain \"disciplined\" and \"open to a diverse range of views.\" \"When we disagree, it's never personal. Once a decision is made, we execute it -- together,\" reads the memo. \"We know there will be tough days, but we will bounce back and get back to work.\" The document also appears to telegraph the name to Clinton's campaign: \"Hillary for America.\" Clinton is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on Sunday through a video message on social media, according to Democratic sources.

{"document":"North Korea is in the headlines again. According to a Wall Street Journal report Thursday, Chinese nuclear experts have told the United States that Pyongyang may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads. And while that number may seem stunning, it is actually only part of a troubling story. The key takeaway from the latest assessment of North Korea's nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads, but the type of warhead, as this gives a better clue to the future of the country's weapons capabilities. True, the reported Chinese estimate of 20 warheads is large enough to constitute a nuclear \"arsenal.\" However, this number is not actually significantly larger than conventional open source estimates of 10 to 15 warheads previously provided by U.S. and other experts. The big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that North Korea could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons-grade uranium. If that assessment is correct, and Pyongyang can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly-enriched weapons-grade uranium, then the plutonium program that the U.S. and members of the Six-Party talks had been negotiating over this past quarter century would suddenly seem trivial. After all, the plutonium program might be capable of spitting out maybe a few weapons worth of plutonium annually. This news could be much more serious. Why? For a start, it would mean that North Korea's activities would undoubtedly meet the definition, if it had not already, of a runaway nuclear weapons program, with the potential to be fueled by a large supply of raw uranium buried in North Korea's mines. In addition, while the plutonium program at Yongbyon has a clear and detectable profile, the thousands of centrifuges that spin in a uranium-based program have no detectable heat signature or topographic profile, meaning you could store the stuff not just in the labyrinth of underground tunnels in North Korea, undetectable from the sky, but in any large warehouse. Washington and Seoul have tended to have a policy that leans toward downplaying North Korean threats, at least when there isn't a full-fledged crisis going on. For example, the United States downplayed North Korea's missile threat until the country successfully put a satellite into orbit in December 2012. And up until 2006, no one thought the Kim regime would actually dare undertake a nuclear test. These new estimates could therefore be a timely reminder that we may have downplayed the threat North Korea poses once again. But Thursday's report isn't the only troubling information we have had recently. Just as concerning is the NORAD commander's assessment on North Korea's missile capabilities. On April 7, Adm. Bill Gortney said during a press briefing that the Defense Department believed Pyongyang's KN-08 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is operational, with a warhead capacity. This statement is troubling for two reasons. First, Gortney's statement, when combined with the latest Chinese assessment, implies that North Korea now not only has nuclear weapons, but the ability to miniaturize such weapons for a warhead that could be placed atop a missile with range rings extending to the U.S. mainland. Second, and just as importantly, Pyongyang's advances in mobile ICBM capabilities could end up undermining the state of stable deterrence that currently exists on the Korean Peninsula. Put simply, these capabilities could give North Korea confidence that it is immune from any U.S. counterstrikes. And if that ends up being the case, the United States could find itself with a renewed headache in Asia -- and its carefully calibrated plans for its pivot to the region crumbling.\n","right_summary":"Report says North Korea may have as many as 20 nuclear warheads.

{"document":"A two-year-old girl in southern California was found naked sitting by herself in a parking lot two hours after disappearing from her mother at a car wash. The Gardena toddler reportedly shouted 'mommy' before her mother turned around and could not find her daughter around 4.55 pm on Thursday. Her girl, who has not been identified, was found injured outside of Jim's Burgers 13 miles away and was spotted by concerned customers next to a dumpster. Scroll down for video. A two-year-old girl from Gardena, California, was found Thursday night after disappearing from a car wash and shouting 'mommy' Police are searching for the driver of a white recent-model Nissan Altima, which was seen at the car wash around the time the girl was abducted. Claudia Robles, who was heading into the burger joint around 7.15pm, said that the little girl had scratches on her legs and was afraid of going toward the male police officers. The little girl, whom Gardena police have asked not to be identified, repeatedly covered her eyes and screamed after she was found. Police, who originally said she was OK, would not describe the extent of her injuries, according to\u00a0KTLA. The girl's mother was too distressed to speak to media. 'She's a pure little innocent baby,' her aunt Grecian Alvarez said.

{"document":"Northampton's maligned hit man is primed to go big-game hunting again  with no intention of toning down his use of legitimate force in the wake of renewed criticism. Courtney Lawes arrived in France with the Saints, ahead of the Champions Cup quarter-final against mighty Clermont Auvergne, carrying notoriety as excess baggage. His brutal tackle on France fly-half Jules Plisson at Twickenham last month, in the Six Nations finale, angered the visitors to the extent that they tried to have him banned. While the match officials and citing officer deemed that no action was needed, the England lock has been derided as a thug across the Channel and there were cries of protest in these parts, too. England lock Courtney Lawes made a trademark hit on France fly-half Jules Plisson. Click here to read Jeff's article on Lawes' tackle. Writing in these pages, Jeff Powell suggested that Lawes should apologise for an offence that he argued would put parents off allowing their children to play such a brutal, damaging game. The comments found their target but the 26-year-old is a laid-back character and was unfazed by the storm he had created. \u2018I just took it on the chin and thought, \u201cPeople are going to say what they think sometimes, and sometimes people are going to view things differently\u201d,\u2019 said Lawes as he prepared for another momentous Anglo-French encounter. \u2018Obviously he has the outlet of the Daily Mail to post his thoughts. I tweeted him. I wasn\u2019t fussed about it but I thought I\u2019d send him a little tweet, just to get my own back a bit!\u2019 Aside from that particular outburst of condemnation, there were widespread concerns expressed about the timing and legality of his tackling style, but Lawes is unperturbed and emphasised his largely clean disciplinary record. \u2018To be honest, as long as it is legal and I\u2019m not putting my team in any jeopardy doing it, in terms of me getting booked or sent off or anything like that, I\u2019m going to do anything I can to help the team,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019m not the sort of person who is fussed about what people think of me. I\u2019m only bothered about what I can do for my team and for myself as a player. Coaches know how good you are, no matter what things other people are saying outside the room. Lawes crumples Plisson in the aftermath of his monstrous tackle on the French fly half. \u2018The fact is that my record is very clean. I\u2019ve only been cited once and I\u2019ve never been red-carded. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had many yellows, if any, this year. I don\u2019t have a malicious streak. I know I\u2019m not a thug, I don\u2019t go around punching or fighting, any of that rubbish. \u2018I just get on with the game. I don\u2019t even allow people to get me too aggravated, I just get on with my own thing. I\u2019m comfortable being who I am. If people want to say I\u2019m something else, that\u2019s fair enough.\u2019 One of the accusations levelled at Lawes is that he sets out to intimidate smaller opponents, notably half-backs, leading to a multitude of one-sided collisions. He argues that trying to unsettle and nullify these primary decision- makers is a reasonable and vital aspect of his repertoire. \u2018If you can put pressure on the 10, then you go out and put pressure on the 10, and if you can do it legally then why can\u2019t you do it?\u2019 he said. \u2018That\u2019s the way I see it. I\u2019ve got that kind of timing around the ruck and I\u2019ve got the speed to get to the 10. My size is the reason that the impact is so big, but I don\u2019t go looking for it. A livid Yoann Maestri pushed Lawes in the face and grapples with the England man following his challenge. Lawes and Maestri continue their disagreement on their feet as matters threaten to boil over. \u2018It makes a big difference to the game if you can stop the 10 from passing or stop that particular play. It doesn\u2019t even have to be a big hit, it just makes a difference if that 10 knows that he has pressure on him. \u2018There is obviously a line between a legitimate and a late tackle because people get yellow-carded for late tackles. \u2018You watch the replay of the hit on Plisson and the other player has not caught the ball before we\u2019ve hit the ground. The fact is, had the tackle not looked as severe as it did no-one would have said anything. \u2018The only reason is because of the impact, which looks bad because he\u2019s landed on his head. I haven\u2019t tipped him up or anything like that \u2014 I\u2019ve just followed through with my tackle. I didn\u2019t even know he didn\u2019t have the ball until I looked up afterwards.\u2019 26-year-old Lawes passes the ball during a Northampton Saints training session earlier this week. Lawes has revealed that he intends to maintain his destructive style of play for Northampton on Saturday. Asked if he intended to resume normal, destructive service for Northampton on Saturday \u2014 in defiance of the criticism \u2014 he added: \u2018Yeah, of course. I\u2019ve never done anything to get myself sent off in terms of my tackle timing or whatever, so why would I stop if it is legal?\u2019 Northampton, the champions of England, face a colossal challenge against a French club who simply do not lose at home, especially in Europe. The Saints and three of their fellow Aviva Premiership teams have daunting ties away from home, but captain Dylan Hartley has hope for the quartet. \u2018I am fully confident in ourselves,\u2019 Hartley said. \u2018I think Wasps have a big ask in Toulon but we saw with 14 men the other night how dangerous they can be. I think Sarries against Racing could get a result there. And Bath v Leinster, who knows? I think there could be a few upsets.\u2019\n","right_summary":"Courtney Lawes has been derided as a thug across the Channel. France tried to get him banned for brutal tackle on Jules Plisson.

{"document":"A New York man who won three marathons in eight days last month said that his winnings will go toward the medical bills of his infant son, who has spina bifida, a developmental congenital disorder. Bryan Morseman, 29, from Bath, New York, started his streak at the Montgomery Marathon in Alabama on March 14. He ran the Tobacco Road Marathon in Cary, North Carolina, the next morning because it was one the way home to New York. A week later he placed first at the Yeungling Shamrock Marathon in Virginia Beach. Bryan Morseman, 29, of Bath, New York,\u00a0ran three marathons in eight days in hopes of raising money to pay for Leeim's medical bills. Leeim was born with spina bifida, a developmental congenital disorder that starts in the womb when a baby's spine doesn't form properly. In total, the full-time precious metal clerk earned $5,750 in winnings from the races, all of which will go toward medical treatment for his nine-month-old son Leeim, who has spina bifida. 'Every time I'm in a race I think of him and how my pain is nothing compared to what he has gone through,' Morseman told the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. 'He gives me the energy shot to pick me up and carry me through to the finish.' Since his first 26.2-mile race in 2008, Morseman has won 23 of the 42 marathons he's participated in. And he takes each race as it comes, not training for a specific race. 'I don't like putting all my eggs in one basket,' he said. 'When you only run a few, you waste time, training and money if it doesn't go well.' Bryan Morseman (right), pictured with his wife Sarah and son Leeim in 2014, has been running marathons since 2008. He has won 23 of the 42 26.2-mile races he has participated in. And last spring, Morseman and his wife Sarah were told their unborn sun was diagnosed with spina bifida, a condition that develops in the womb when a baby's spinal column doesn't form properly. If the condition is untreated, it can lead to brain damage, loss of leg usage and other heath problems. Following a series of doctor's appointments, Morseman, his pregnant wife, and their now two-year-old son went to Philadelphia so Sarah could undergo prenatal surgery, which led to Leeim being born on June 20. Nearly ten months later, Leeim does physical therapy three times a week, but it is \u00a0unknown as to whether or not he will be able to walk. Leeim was born prematurely because if spina bifida is left untreated, it can lead to brain damage and loss of leg usage. Morseman said that knowing he's raising money for his son give him 'the energy shot' he needs to win races. As for Morseman, he trains for his races during his lunch breaks and late at night after his sons are asleep. When it's dark, his wife follows him in the car. The life-long runner's personal best is 2:19:57 at the Pocono Marathon Run for Red Mountain, which he's won four times, last May. He ran his three March races in 2:24:40 in Alabama,\u00a02:32:39 in North Carolina and\u00a02:24:10 in Virginia. As an ultimate goal he'd hope to qualify for the U.S. Olympic Marathon Trails, which has a standard of 2:18 to get in. But Morseman has other things on his mind. 'We'll see,' he told the Democrat and Chronicle. 'Other things happen in life. Right now, my family is far more important than qualifying.' The Morseman family has created a GoFundMe page to help pay for medical bills. Morseman said his family is very supportive of him running marathons. He trains during his lunch breaks and late at night when his sons are asleep.\n","right_summary":"Bryan Morseman, of Bath, New York, won marathons on March 14, 15 and 22.

{"document":"Think it's hard to redeem your miles for an airline award ticket? It depends on which airline rewards program you've chosen, which route you're flying and when you book your ticket, according to a new Consumer Reports study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years. The magazine collected statistics comparing award-seat availability for the five biggest U.S. airlines on domestic routes. The top performer was Southwest Airlines, which offered the most award tickets, 11.9 million, and the highest percentage of award tickets -- 11.5% of 103.1 million total passenger seats. \"The high number of award tickets is directly related to Southwest's unique combination of 'Every Seat is an Award Seat,' no blackout dates, points that don't expire, and a route map that reaches more than 90 different destinations in the U.S. and beyond, making us the largest domestic carrier in the U.S.,\" Southwest spokesperson Thais Conway Hanson told CNN. \"Unlike other carriers, we also don't charge fees for close-in bookings or penalize you for canceling your trip if something else comes up.\" At the bottom of the list was JetBlue, which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest U.S. airlines: 892,000 one-way passenger tickets, or 4.5% of its total 19.7 million U.S. seats. (JetBlue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study.) Many JetBlue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year, making it hard to accumulate miles, an airline spokesman told the magazine. By not allowing miles to expire anymore, the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them. Delta Air Lines came in second place with 5.6 million U.S. award seats; United Airlines ranked third with 5 million U.S. award tickets; and American Airlines was fourth with 3.5 million U.S. award seats. What are the world's safest airlines? Remember that award tickets aren't actually free. The cost of miles is built into everything you buy that's earning you miles, and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all. So it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully. On average, nearly 10% of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by Consumer Reports flew on domestic award tickets, but some of them weren't getting the best value for their miles. While many U.S. fliers redeemed miles on American Airlines flights from Los Angeles to San Francisco, the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket, Consumer Reports says. Better to use them on American Airlines' route between New York and San Francisco or Delta's route between Chicago and Los Angeles, which are generally more expensive than that Los Angeles-San Francisco route, according to Consumer Reports' calculations. While award-seat availability is important, it may not matter as much as passengers' overall satisfaction with an airline. Southwest had the highest customer satisfaction score (86), followed by JetBlue (85), Delta (70), American (66) and United (63). And don't forget the fees. Southwest doesn't charge any fees, while other airlines tack on fees for checking bags, booking by phone, changing plans and more.\n","right_summary":"Southwest Airlines tops Consumer Reports' survey, with the most seats available.

{"document":"A Lithuanian gangster accused of two murders in his home country has cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds in a deportation farce after claiming he was too depressed to leave Britain. Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him, claiming they breached his human rights. The 52-year-old, who is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, spun out the legal battle for nearly five years by insisting he was mentally ill, leaving the British public to foot the bill. Depression claim: In January last year, Kestutis Martuzevicius was admitted to Broadmoor on health grounds but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh Prison (above) Yesterday judges at the European Court of Human Rights criticised his \u2018manifestly ill-founded\u2019 case and ruled the alleged killer should be put on a plane home. In Lithuania he is accused of 22 crimes including two murders, robbery and extortion between 1993 and 1997, when he was a member of the feared Daktarai gang. The ruling brought to an end a saga that began when a warrant for his arrest was issued by Lithuanian police in June 2010. His case has cost British taxpayers a six-figure sum, according to legal experts. This figure includes the cost of police time, legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts, the \u00a340,000 a year price of keeping him in the Category A prison Belmarsh, and treating him at Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. His case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws. Michael Ellis, a former Tory MP, said: \u2018This is a shocking example of Labour\u2019s Human Rights Act putting the rights of suspected foreign criminals ahead of the rights of the British public.\u2019 Waste of time: Judge Guido Raimondi (above), of the European Court of Human Rights, said: 'The court considers that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected' Martuzevicius came to the UK in 1996. It is thought he claimed asylum. He was arrested in London in June 2011 under a European Arrest Warrant. Magistrates agreed to his extradition in October of that year and he was held in Belmarsh prior to being sent home. But he appealed to the High Court on the grounds he was depressed and would face reprisals by criminals in his homeland if he returned. He claimed this violated Article 2, the right to life, and Article 3, the right to avoid inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. British judges ruled his extradition would not be unjust because he could expect a fair trial and the authorities would protect him from retaliation. But Martuzevicius then launched a new appeal with the European Court of Human Rights. According to court documents, in 2012 he was diagnosed as mentally ill, with a psychiatric report saying he was seriously depressed, suffering from a delusional disorder, and that there was a risk of suicide. In January last year, he was admitted to Broadmoor but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh. He appealed to Strasbourg under Article 3 and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial, because he had not been allowed to argue his ill-health during extradition proceedings. But in a written ruling, the European judges, led by court president Guido Raimondi, said Martuzevicius\u2019s claim that extradition breached his human rights was \u2018inadmissible\u2019. They added: \u2018The court considers this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected.\u2019\n","right_summary":"Gangster Kestutis Martuzevicius accused of two murders in home country.

{"document":"An American company claims to have invented a 'teabag' that can turn an ordinary pint of lager into a craft beer the same way  hot water is turned into brew. The Hop Theory 'beer-bag' contains a blend of hops, fruit peels and natural spices, and promises to turn light beer into craft after just two minutes of steeping. However, despite nearly reaching its crowd-funding target, the project has been criticised by professional breweries as being misleading about what constitutes as 'craft beer'. Scroll down for video. Transformation: The Hop Theory sachets promises to turn lager into craft beer in just two minutes. Hop Theory, based in Maryland, is nearing its $25,000 target on crowd-funding site Kickstarter to produce its first blend, claiming it will turn lager into 'craft beer' in just two to four minutes. Bobby Gattuso, who founded the company as a biology student in 2013,  hopes to revolutionise beer drinking. 'Craft beer excels in taste but it's expensive. Light beer is cost effective and low in calories but lacks flavour, and with Hop Theory, an average beer becomes craft.' Emily Williamson of independent brewery\u00a0Cheddar Ales in Somerset, England, is sceptical to the idea of 'tea bag' beer. 'Firstly,\u00a0adding hops, flavouring herbs, peels during the brewing process is about stabilizing those ingredients to make them safe for consumption. 'Secondly, and most importantly, the boiling phase is when your wort (the unfermented liquid extracted from the mashing process) concentrates, and flavours, aroma and balance are carefully adjusted  to create the complexity people of our beer drinking generation are after.' New drink: After a short infusion of two minutes, the blend of hops, dried fruit and spices will have changed the taste of a lighter lager into that on par with a craft beer. New ideas: The Relativity blend contains dried and ground orange peel, Cascade hops and ground coriander seeds, and is set to hit the market this summer. Ms Williamson adds that the claim that the Hop Theory sachets can make a lager taste like a craft beer could also 'mislead people'. 'To add a sachet to a pre-balanced, pre-made beer will only add a glimmer of the flavours available in traditionally made beers. 'For example our latest brew, Firewitch Spicy Farmhouse Saison, has had citrus peel in it for over two weeks, which really allows for a multitude of flavours to release into the brew. 'So, without tasting the product, I can only guess that it won't add anywhere near the depth of flavour that the actual brewing process can achieve as it's not inherent to the structure.' Hannah Rhodes, founder of Hiver beers, says: 'Good quality beer is more expensive because avoiding shortcuts and brewing naturally takes time, normally 3 to 6 times longer than that of it's mainstream competitors.' 'Here at Hiver, the honeys we source are fermented at the start of the process along with the cereals, and by not adding honey for flavouring at the end, you get a lovely crisp and refreshing finish and not something that's sweet or cloying or artificial. 'The entrepreneurs behind the Hop Theory have spotted a great opportunity and I honestly think, anything that encourages people to think more seriously about what they eat and drink and experiment with taste, flavour and quality, is a good thing, so I wish them the best of luck.' Their words are echoed by Durham Atkinson, owner of London craft beer pub and brewery Hops & Glory. 'In all honesty, I am not convinced that the attention to the brewing process in craft beer can be outdone in a sachet. 'The countless hours brewers spend watching their boil, trying and testing their beers and tweaking recipes and temperatures countless times I doubt can be solved by this product. I would however give it a go to see if a tasteless lager is improved by the sachet.' Reusable: Each sachet can be used in up to four beers, so keeps both costs and calories down. Guide: A graphic from Mr Gattuso's Kickstarter campaign describes how to use the Hop Theory sachets. Hop Theory's first blend Relativity contains dried and ground orange peel, Cascade hops and ground coriander seeds, with another four blends planned for this year - raspberry, pumpkin, double IPA and peach. Each 5g Hop Theory sachet can transfuse up to four beers, so one bag could keep the drinker going for a session at the pub. The first infusion will take between two and four minutes, but once the bag is wet, any further uses will only take about 30 seconds to transfuse, Mr Gattuso says. 'We have been meticulously fine-tuning the perfect balance of ingredients to create our first blend and are finally ready to begin production. 'Hop Theory is here to add customisation to the beer industry. 'There's only five calories in each sachet, so it improves a light beer without adding pounds or going penniless. 'It took a long time to create the perfect blend but finally Relativity was born and as our first blend, we think we nailed it. It is delicious and refreshing. 'No longer will you have to settle for what's being served or dream about the beer you could be having. 'We simply want to to give everyone control over how their beer tastes.'

{"document":"Chelsea are set to be without star striker Diego Costa for Sunday's trip to Arsenal after he failed to recover in time from a hamstring injury. Blues manager Jose Mourinho said on Friday that he would make a late decision on Costa\u2019s fitness, but his leading scorer is not in a condition to play at the Emirates Stadium. Costa suffered the latest in a string of hamstring injuries against Stoke City three weeks ago but Chelsea are wary of risking him while they hold a comfortable lead in the Barclays Premier League. Costa has not featured for Chelsea since going off injured against Stoke on April 4. Costa is not even likely to be named on the bench for Chelsea at the Emirates on Sunday. The Spain striker is unlikely to even make the bench for Sunday\u2019s top-of-the-table clash and he could also miss the potential title clincher at Leicester City on Wednesday night. Mourinho confessed on Friday that Loic Remy was not ready to return from an injury suffered in training two weeks ago, leaving Didier Drogba as the only senior striker available to him. The Chelsea manager had hoped that Costa would be able to train with the rest of the squad this week but his participation has been limited by his injury. Chelsea\u2019s 17-year-old forward Dominic Solanke \u2013 who has played just 17 minutes for the first team - will deputise on the bench. Loic Remy is also out of the match leaving Didier Drogba as Chelsea's only fit senior striker. The young hitman has scored 35 goals at youth level this season but was left out of the Under 21 side\u2019s 3-0 win over Everton on Thursday. \u2018Didier for sure is fine, Remy is out for sure and with Diego we will make a decision tomorrow,\u2019 Mourinho said on Friday. \u2018Diego is a very important player for us but the reality is we are coping with the difficulty of every match without him. Chelsea's 17-year-old striker Dominic Solanke (centre) is set to be named on the bench. \u2018The team is adapting to play in a different way. In the last period we are more strategic and less artistic but we are getting results.\u2019 Chelsea are 10 points clear in the Premier League title race and wins against Arsenal and Leicester would see them crowned champions before the end of April. Costa has been sidelined four times this season with his hamstrings, which also gave him trouble at the tail end of his last campaign with Atletico Madrid.\n","right_summary":"Chelsea face Arsenal at the Emirates on Sunday in the Premier League.

Investigators located the infant's head along with two blood-soaked blouses and a  bag more than 50 miles away in Orange township. Authorities released the sketch of Emma and the photos Friday enlisting the help of the public to locate the infant's mother. 'Detectives hope someone may recognize the baby based on the composite sketch or provide assistance to find the mother based on the items of clothing,' police said. The release states that no current evidence indicates that the mother was a 'victim of foul play,' but authorities have not ruled out the possibility. A medical examiner has determined that Emma was not stillborn, but the cause of the child's death is still unknown.

{"document":"As Jeremy Clarkson continues to battle to save his career after being sacked form Top Gear, his estranged wife has been enjoying a family break in the\u00a0Caribbean. Frances Clarkson showed off her tanned figure in a white bikini as she relaxed on a beach in Barbados. The 53 year old revealed the results of a week sunbathing over Easter in the skimpy swimsuit, which was covered in a black palm tree print. Scroll down for video. Frances Clarkson showed of her holiday tan in a white bikini during a dip in the sea on her Barbados holiday today. Frances appeared to be deep in thought as she paddled around in the clear blue waters, where she had been jet skiing two days beforehand. She accessorised with a Help For Heroes wristband and swept her sun-bleached hair up into a butterfly clip. Frances has previously holidayed in the area with the 54-year-old broadcaster - they headed to the island together after he was first pictured with his reported girlfriend Phillipa Sage. But Frances and Jeremy, who have two daughters and a son, are said to have lived apart for  years. The 53 year old appeared deep in conversation as she headed across the beach to take a dip. Frances accessorised her look with a Help For Heroes wristband. The BBC announced last month they were dropping Clarkson from the hit motoring show after a 'fracas' involving a Top Gear producer. Clarkson left Oisin Tymon needing hospital treatment after punching him at a hotel in Hawes, North Yorkshire, after staff wouldn't serve him a hot meal following a day of filming. He has repeatedly apologised to Mr Tymon both in public and privately and it was announced today that he will not face any criminal charges for the attack. Holiday: Frances Clarkson, 53, spent the Easter Bank Holiday weekend with family and friends in Barbados. Rushing to his side to comfort him throughout the ordeal has been events organiser Phillipa Sage, 45, who became a feature in his life in 2010 when he was still in a relationship with Frances. It was claimed last year that his marriage had been under strain after reports he had engaged in extra-martial affairs. Last summer he told the MailOnline's Piers Morgan he was 'going through a difficult divorce'. In April 2011 Clarkson was accused of having an affair with Miss Sage while touring Australia, South Africa and Norway with his Top Gear co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May. Sunshine: Frances was spotted in a black bikini as she drove a jet ski and caught some rays in the sun. Relax: The 53-year-old has previously holidayed on the island with her estranged husband Jeremy Clarkson. He was alleged to have spent several nights with Miss Sage and kissed her on the lips in full view of observers on one occasion. Clarkson shrugged off the claims at the time, saying that he and Miss Sage had been simply 'colleagues fooling around'. But shortly afterwards it was revealed that he was spending time during the week living in a bachelor pad in London. He denied that he had moved out of the family home in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, saying he used the London flat when he was editing Top Gear. Clarkson was photographed kissing Miss Sage while on holiday with her in Greece in 2013, and they also visited Australia again. In October 2011 Clarkson lifted a High Court gagging order preventing his first wife, Alex Hall, from claiming that he had had an affair with her after he married Frances. Split: Frances has two daughters and a son with the 54-year-old broadcaster, but the pair are said to have been living apart for years.

Mrs Hall, who married him in 1989 but separated from him after less than two years, alleged that they rekindled their relationship from 1999 onwards \u2013 something he denied. Clarkson married Frances in 1993 and she encouraged him to cultivate a more aggressive on-screen persona to make Top Gear more controversial, say friends. In recent years he has been caught up in other controversies, including being accused of racism after he called an Asian man a 'slope' when he joked about the construction of a bridge in Thailand during an episode of Top Gear.

{"document":"A couple who were told their severely disabled baby may die within hours of being born are celebrating her first birthday. When Sonia Morales was pregnant, her daughter Angela was diagnosed with anencephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born without parts of their brain and skull. But Sonia and her husband Rony, who live in Providence, Rhode Island, decided to 'keep her no matter what.' A couple who were told their severely disabled baby may die within hours of being born are celebrating her first birthday. Pictured:\u00a0Sonia and her husband Rony, with Elizabeth, four, and Angela, now one. Elizabeth with her little sister. Angela has anencephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born without parts of their brain and skull - many newborns with the condition die soon after birth. Angela, who weighs only 16 lbs., celebrated her first birthday on\u00a0March 23 alongside their four-year-old daughter Elizabeth. They were prepared that they may lose Angela from the moment she was born. 'When we went to the hospital, I thought I was going to be saying hello and goodbye on the same day,' says Sonia to\u00a0People. 'We sang her a song that we made for her. It was during an ultrasound that Sonia Morales was told her daughter was not developing properly. Sonia says her daughter is aware that her little sister is sick, but just wants to spend as much time with her as she can. Everyday the family\u00a0sing a birthday song, along with a birthday cake and a prayer as they celebrate Angela's life. After her birth, doctors told the family it was a critical period, but a week later they were thrilled to bring her home. The family have been celebrating every day with Angela since as they know life could be short for their sick daughter - they have a birthday cake and sing every day. 'Every day is truly a gift. She knows how much she is loved,' Sonia says. Anencephaly occurs between the third and fourth weeks of pregnancy. During that time, the neural tube is supposed to close and fold over to form the brain and spinal cord of the fetus. This process fails to occur in anencephalic pregnancies, resulting in the absence of a large portion of the brain, skull and scalp. Babies born with anencephaly are usually blind, deaf, unconcious and unable to feel pain. They are usually stillborn but in rare cases they may survive longer. The rate of anencephaly is one or two per 10,000 births. Sonia says her other daughter is aware that her little sister is sick. She wrote on a Facebook post: 'From the beginning we tried to explain that her baby sister would have to go to Heaven with Jesus because her head was not fully formed. She took it in a very natural way. 'Eli was always there close to help me with her sister. Rony and I, did not want her to see Angela's head without the hat that covered the hole in her head. 'But one day I did not locked the door when I was doing Angelas's dressings and I was washing her wound. Elizabeth's first reaction is priceless, \"Mami she has hair, she is beautiful!\" 'Elizabeth didn't see Angela's deformity she saw her sister, she saw her beauty. 'And from that day she was the one who helped me clean the opening. 'Passing me the gloves, tape and bandages. She told me, Angela is different from other children but who cares mommy she is beautiful God made her like this.' Angela has part of her brain missing and one of her eyes is shut, but she has made progress in the past year. Sonia posted a video online which shows her moving her head as she calls her voice and she recognizes those familiar to her. Although her future is still uncertain the family are making the most of their time with her and take her on family outings. The Morales have created a GoFundMe\u00a0page to help with medical expenses. They have also made a Facebook page which offers updates on Angela's health as well as offering support to other families whose children have anencephaly.

{"document":"Accused: Dr Ram Manohar, 38, of Barnston, Wirral, has denied four counts of sexual assault. A senior doctor facing sexual assault allegations from two separate nurses is accused of groping the breast of one of them and saying 'you bad girl' after smacking her on the bottom. A&E consultant Dr Ram Manohar, 38, is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital. David McLachlan, prosecuting, said Manohar offered to help Nurse A with her training on December 23, 2013,\u00a0Liverpool Crown Court heard. He said she knew Manohar and, while in his room, asked for his help to learn about matters including chest X-rays. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any warning Ram Manohar put his hand down her nurse's dress and he put his hands into her bra.' She said he moved his hand around but she had not asked for a demonstration. Nurse A said he later asked her a question about the heart, which she got wrong. She said: 'He smacked me on the bottom quite hard and said to me, \"you bad girl\".' Mr McLachlan said Manohar squeezed her left breast to indicate where her left ventricle was and while discussing breast lumps asked to see her nipple, but she refused. She said the conversation moved onto the femoral pulse. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any word of warning he put his hand up her dress and down her tights.' Manohar then allegedly touched her inappropriately. Nurse A said he told her 'this type of teaching is only for you' before she left the room 'feeling disgusted with herself'. She later told friends she felt 'violated' before contacting police. Manohar told officers he had known her since working with her at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. He said after a night out she had asked him back to her house, but he had refused. He said she had also asked him on December 12 'to find her a single and smart man because she was desperate'. Manohar said on December 23 she unzipped her top, making him uncomfortable, and followed him around 'like a puppy'. The doctor denied touching her inappropriately and said his office door had been open. He said she had been pointing to different parts of her body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive'. Manohar is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital (pictured). Nurse A said he groped her breast after she asked him about chest X-rays. Nurse B alleged that Manohar touched her inappropriately on July 10 and October 31, 2013. She said the first time she went to A&E because she had pins and needles in her hands and feet. Nurse B said he examined and touched her genital area. However, she said she thought he had been professional and thanked him before he gave her a hug. She said on October 31 she saw him about a 'very bad headache' and he treated her in a dark room, checking her reflexes before touching her genital area. The A&E consultant claims he had been pointing to different parts of Nurse A's body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive' Nurse B again thought he had acted professionally and went to the hospital to drop off a thank you card. She said he invited her to meet him for coffee and she went to the hospital for 'a coffee type date' because she did not know he was married. Nurse B alleged Manohar invited her into his office, kissed her, told her how beautiful she was and suddenly without warning put his hand into her knickers. Mr McLachlan said: 'She stopped him straightaway. He told her that he was married with children.' Nurse B also reported him to the police. Manohar told officers he did not inappropriately touch her during either examination. He said she told him she had feelings for him but he said he was married and she started crying. Manohar admitted he then kissed her but said he did not think he had put his hand into her knickers. He said: 'I think she caught my hand and put it on top of her trousers or something.'

Iain Mackay, 40, is believed to have argued with Nilobon Patty in a separate venue in Hua Hin, a resort some 125miles southwest of Bangkok, shortly before his death.

Tragic: Iain Mackay's Thai girlfriend Nilobon Patty, known as Patty Patrick, has denied any involvement in the death of the 40-year-old Scot. According to Ms Patty, the couple had been seeing each other for three years, but that Mr Mackay ended their relationship last month as his work overseas prevented him from settling down with her. She claims she was not with another man, but out with friends, when an 'obviously drunk' Mr Mackay appeared in the bar around 1am. Tragic: Mr Mackay, 40, allegedly got into a fight after discovering Ms Patty talking to another man. Ms Patty claims Mr Mackay, from Stornoway, Scotland,\u00a0shouted at her, accused her of laughing at him, after which she decided to go home. Police informed her of Mr Mackay's incident in her place of work the next day, she told\u00a0The Daily Record.

{"document":"The United States has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion, especially in Indiana, where its new Religious Freedom Restoration Act faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people. Such state laws have been growing ever since the U.S. Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993, designed to prohibit the federal government from \"substantially burdening\" a person's exercise of religion. So far, 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law, and the legal controversies have grown, too. Nonetheless, claims under those state RFRAs are \"exceedingly rare,\" and victories involved mostly religious minorities, not Christian denominations, experts say. \"There is reason to doubt whether these state-level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers,\" wrote Wayne State University law professor Christopher Lund in a 2010 analysis, when there were only 16 states with such laws. Here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws, touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an IRS accountant to a tea from the Amazon:. He was a Native American with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes. But not in the eyes of the feds. In 2006, Robert Soto and Michael Russell attended an American Indian powwow while in possession of eagle feathers, in violation of the federal Eagle Protection Act, which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground. Soto, a Lipan Apache, asserted he was participating in an Indian religious ceremony. The feathers are sacred to Native Americans. But a federal Fish and Wildlife Service agent found his tribe wasn't federally recognized, and Soto surrendered his feathers. Russell, who is married to Soto's sister, isn't American Indian and agreed to pay a fine, according to court papers and the America Bar Association Journal. Soto, however, petitioned the federal Interior Department to return his feathers. The feds said no, because he wasn't from a recognized tribe. Soto and Russell sued the federal government, but a federal district court ruled in favor of the government, rejecting the two men's First Amendment assertions and their claims under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the same 1993 statute that Indiana legislators used in developing their new state law. But last August, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision and sent the case back to that court after finding the government's action would violate the federal RFRA. On March 10, the federal government returned the eagle feathers to Soto. But the legal war isn't over. The federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute Soto and his congregants, so Soto is seeking a preliminary injunction, claiming the feds are violating the federal RFRA, said Luke Goodrich, Soto's attorney who's with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. A tea used by a Brazilian faith is to them like wine used by Catholics at communion, but U.S. agents considered the brew an illegal drug. The religious organization O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal uses a sacramental tea called hoasca, made from two plants native to the Amazon that contains dimethyltryptamine, a hallucinogen, in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. The religion is a Christian spiritist faith that originated in Brazil and includes Amazonian and indigenous spiritual traditions. About 140 members of the church live in the United States and use the tea in a sacred communion. In May 1999, U.S. Customs agents entered the church headquarters in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and seized all of its hoasca. The church became alarmed and cited how the federal government allows an exception for American Indians to use another illegal drug, peyote, in their religious ceremonies. In fact, the federal RFRA was designed partly to protect the Native Americans' use of peyote, said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \"They were a legitimate religion, and this was a legitimate ritual of the religion, and Congress wanted to make sure it was protected,\" Toobin said of peyote and the 1993 law. The Uniao do Vegetal, which means \"the union of the plants,\" cited that federal law in suing the federal government. \"The government has never explained why it has accommodated The Native American Church's use of peyote (which contains mescaline, also a controlled substance) but cannot accommodate the UDV's use of hoasca,\" the church said in a statement. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the church's favor, saying the federal government failed to show a compelling interest to ban the substance for religious use. \"The peyote exception also fatally undermines the government's broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA,\" the court ruling said. Bruce Rich, an Orthodox Jewish prisoner in Florida, wanted kosher meals, but the warden said no. So Rich sued the state prison system in 2010, saying its denial of a kosher menu violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, a landmark civil law rights law for inmates whose predecessor was the federal religious freedom law. Rich, 66, is serving a life sentence for murdering his parents, in their 70s, in 1995 allegedly to inherit their home. The prison system argued the meals were costly and would lead to security concerns, namely \"retaliation against the kosher inmates\" if other inmates believed the higher costs of kosher meals impacted the quality of their food, court papers said. At least 35 other states and the federal government, however, provided kosher diets to inmates. After losing before a magistrate, Rich won an appeal before the 11th Circuit Court, which cited \"the defendant's meager efforts to explain why Florida's prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in Florida.\" Recently baptized in the Sikh faith, Kawal Tagore went to her job with the IRS in Houston in 2005 carrying a new religious item: a 9-inch kirpan, a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved. Tagore needed to carry the kirpan at all times as a mandatory article of faith. But the federal government banned her from the building, citing the kirpan as a \"dangerous weapon\" with a more than 3-inch blade, and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace. Tagore sued the government under the federal law. Tagore cited how the government allowed the public to enter the federal building with more threatening objects: real 2.5-inch blade knives and metal canes, said her attorneys with the Newar Law Firm and the Becket Fund. Also, federal employees inside the building were allowed to use box cutters and cake knives. In November, the federal government agreed to settle the case shortly after the start of Tagore's trial. The settlement included no admission of wrongdoing, the Christian Science Monitor reported. Tagore's attorneys described the settlement as \"a groundbreaking policy allowing Sikhs and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings,\" they said in a statement. Invoking a religious freedom law and related statutes doesn't always equate to victory. In Chicago, an association of 40 churches called the Civil Liberties for Urban Believers found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones. The ministers needed a special use permit, but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one, the church leaders claimed. In fact, it was easier to get a club, lodge or community center approved. So the pastors sued the city of Chicago in 2000, alleging that its zoning laws violated the Illinois religious freedom statute, the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the U.S. Constitution. But in 2003, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group's claims, finding no substantial burden on the churches, which also failed to establish their RLUIPA claim. Defeated, church leaders were angry. \"The forty (40) churches in C.L.U.B. and certainly people of all faiths throughout Chicago are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act passed unanimously by Congress in 2000,\" Apostle Theodore Wilkinson, the group's chairman, said in a statement. \"Also alarming is the court's conclusion that Chicago's religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws. The majority opinion would apparently extend free speech protection to religious assemblies only if they allowed live nude dancing,\" he said. At the same time, the city of Chicago revised its zoning ordinance to avoid \"the threat of heightened scrutiny under RLUIPA,\" according to a League of California Cities report in 2002. CNN's Alexandra Meeks contributed to this report.\n","right_summary":"A Native American from a tribe not recognized by the feds wins the return of his eagle feathers.

{"document":"Niki Lauda is fully expecting Nico Rosberg to turn 'nasty' at some stage after accusing the German and team-mate Lewis Hamilton of being 'egocentric b*******'. Hamilton spearheaded a Mercedes one-two at the Shanghai International Circuit, claiming his fourth Chinese Grand Prix victory and the 35th overall of his Formula One career. Rosberg, though, effectively accused Hamilton of selfishness during the post-race press conference after the reigning champion slowed in the middle stint of the race to preserve his soft tyres. Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda (right) pictured by the circuit in his recognisable red cap. Nico Rosberg speaks with Lauda in the team garage... the German is expected to turn 'nasty' at some stage. That backed up Rosberg who had Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel closing in from behind, forcing him to bemoan the situation to the team over the radio, who responded by asking Hamilton to increase his pace. Rosberg made his feelings plain to Hamilton immediately afterwards, yet the 30-year-old was completely exonerated of any wrongdoing. As far as Mercedes non-executive chairman Lauda was concerned, the actions of Hamilton were that of a driver with a winning mentality. 'We were first and second and I don't care if there is a quarrel, as long as Vettel was third,' said Lauda. 'One thing is clear from my point of view, Lewis had pole position and controlled the race from the beginning to the end, therefore there is no need for a quarrel.' Asked whether Hamilton had the right to be selfish, Lauda replied: 'Sure, he will drive selfish. 'These guys... I call them egocentric b*******, and this is the only way to win a championship. It's the oldest thing. There is no friendship out there. When you race you have to fight, that's it.' Lewis Hamilton waves to the crowd from the podium as Rosberg reflects on finishing behind his team-mate. Hamilton and Rosberg spray champagne from the podium as Mercedes celebrate a one-two finish. Hamilton celebrates his win with the Mercedes team but Rosberg appears less pleased with second. Hamilton backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race. Lauda rightly noted Rosberg opted not to attack Hamilton for the win, instead wanting to preserve his own tyres and hang on to second. The three-times champion, however, believes Rosberg will hit back at some stage, adding: 'Nico will calm himself down. 'For sure, when you are being beaten by your team-mate it hurts. When I was being beaten by (Alain) Prost all the time I was not happy. On the other hand Nico is a guy who comes back quickly, so thank God there is only one week to the next race (in Bahrain) so all this talk will stop quickly when they start driving again on Friday. 'Of course, Lewis bites, he has the talent to bite, but Nico is as nasty as he is if he sees the chance. Don't worry.' It means Rosberg could respond in Bahrain, the scene of their titanic on-track duel last season which sparked their at-times bitter rivalry which culminated in their collision in Belgium. For now, Hamilton holds a 13-point cushion to Vettel, with Rosberg a further four points adrift. Hamilton crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China. Rosberg accused Hamilton of selfishness during the post-race press conference on Sunday. Overall, Hamilton said: 'I'm really happy. It was a great race and really positive to have a clean weekend throughout every session.' Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was fourth ahead of Williams pair Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, with McLaren's Fernando Alonso 12th and Jenson Button 14th. Button had finished 13th, but was handed a five-second post-race penalty for an accident with Lotus' Pastor Maldonado that ended the Venezuelan's grand prix. In his first race with Manor, after missing the first two due to issues, Will Stevens was 15th, finishing ahead of team-mate Roberto Merhi.\n","right_summary":"Lewis Hamilton won the Chinese Grand Prix ahead of Nico Rosberg.

{"document":"A 63-year-old former air hostess has won a \u00a314.5m London mansion from her 'immensely wealthy' 90-year-old Saudi Arabian ex-husband following a legal battle based on a Victorian law. The property, in north west London, which has 'superb views' over a London park, was one of five properties which the successful property developer bought during the couple's 14-year marriage. The couple's main marital home had been a \u00a326m 'palatial residence' in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for which 40 members of staff were employed to keep it ticking over. A 63-year-old former air hostess has won a \u00a314.5m London mansion from her 'immensely wealthy' 90-year-old Saudi Arabian ex-husband following a legal battle at the High Court (pictured) But, after their divorce, the woman - who did not have any financial input into the properties - moved into the townhouse, claiming her right to live there as one of their matrimonial homes. Despite her husband's attempts to evict her from the home, and force the sale of the heavily-mortgaged property, the wife has now been allowed to keep it as part of a complex legal settlement. The 'opulent' maisonette - which was originally three flats converted into one large home - was at one point worth \u00a322m, but is now worth a 'disappointing' \u00a314.5m, the court heard. The husband, who is said to be worth \u00a3600m and  blows up to \u00a310m per year, was also made to give his wife their 'holiday' property in Cannes, which is worth 17m Euros. The judgment, made at the high court, was based on the woman's claim to a right to marital property under the 1882 Married Women\u2019s Property Act. The judge ruled that she should be awarded around \u00a310m on a 'needs light' basis. That was based on \u00a33.5m for London housing, \u00a32.25 million for a replacement holiday home and a further \u00a3500,000 to cover the outgoings on both properties. The court heard that both homes had significant mortgages, meaning they would have respective equities of \u00a33.5m and \u00a35.2m if they are sold. But the judge refused to grant the woman the \u00a3205,014 she was seeking annually to spend on jewellery, handbags and cars. The woman had claimed she needed \u00a3566,045 per year for her \u00a375,000 wardrobe, as well as \u00a325,000 to spend on jewellery. She also needed \u00a325,000 for shoes and another \u00a325,000 for handbags and accessories, she claimed. The couple married in the Central London Mosque (pictured) in 1979 when the man, a property developer, was in his mid-50s and the woman was in her late 20s. They divorced twice, once in 2002 and once in 2013. The judge recognised that the woman's standard of living had been  'lavish and exceptional' during the marriage but said that it was 'not reasonable' to expect that to continue. He added: 'If the wife exceeds this figure, she will have only herself to blame.' The judge also pointed out that, had it been an entirely English case, the woman would have been entitled to \u00a344million - the figure she originally sought - out of total \u00a3287.5million in assets. He said that even though she was 'clearly not a lady of business', she was the homemaker and mother, which made her contribution to the marriage equal to her husband. 'The authorities make it clear that she is not to be discriminated against for the way in which the parties organised their respective roles,' he said. The woman, from Lebanon, took the legal action against the businessman at the High Court in London. Had the same case been heard in Saudi Arabia, the woman would have been entitled to all but nothing. The couple married at the Central London Mosque in 1979 when the man was in his mid 50s and the woman was in her late 20s. They divorced in 1999, before remarrying in 2002. They then separated again in 2013, before divorcing in Saudi Arabia. The court heard that the main marital home had been in Saudi Arabia, where her rights would have been very different. But she was allowed to bring the case in London because the family had spent most summers during their marriage in the capital to escape the 'intolerable' Saudi Arabian heat, making it one of their matrimonial homes. Their children had also gone to nursery here during the holidays and the woman had lived here for at least one year when the case was brought. The court heard the husband owned properties in Paris, which sold for 15million Euros in 2013, and Beirut, which sold for $15.5m. His wife had kept the profit from the Paris flat, he said. Details of the case emerged in a ruling by Mr Justice Moor following a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in November. The row broke out when the pair were reunited in 2002, with the wife alleging that her husband had promised to transfer her some of his properties. The court heard that the husband, said to be a member of several London clubs, had indeed transferred different properties to other members of his family, including his wife. But the judge rejected the claim that he would have promised to transfer his wife any properties for any other reason than tax, insisting he was still the 'beneficial owner' of the property. He said: 'It is inherently improbable. He is a Saudi businessman with great stature. I cannot conceive that he would willingly part with all his residential property. Why should he? He had no intention of losing control of his various residential properties.' The judge also found that the wife had 'embellished and altered her recollection to suit her case'. The Married Women's Property Act 1882 was an act that significantly altered English law regarding the property rights of married women. Among the laws it introduced, it allowed married women to own and control property in their own right. It came following an 1836 Caroline Norton court case which highlighted the injustice of English property laws, and generated enough support that eventually resulted in the Married Women\u2019s Property Act. Many of the elements have since been superseded by subsequent family law statutes.\n","right_summary":"House in London was one of five properties the man -\u00a0worth \u00a3600m - owned.

{"document":"The FBI charged a Philadelphia woman on Thursday with trying to travel overseas to fight for ISIS. She's one of three women arrested this week on terror charges. Two New York women were also taken into custody. An FBI complaint cites numerous social media messages dating back to August 2013 that were sent by Keonna Thomas, 30, also known as \"Young Lioness\" and \"Fatayat Al Khilafah.\" One Twitter message said, \"If we truly knew the realities ... we all would be rushing to join our brothers in the front lines pray ALLAH accept us as shuhada [martyrs].\" Another said, \"When you're a mujahid [violent jihadi fighter] your death becomes a wedding.\" The FBI said Thomas purchased an electronic visa to Turkey on March 23. Turkey is known as the easiest place from which to enter Syria and join ISIS. An ISIS manual advises recruits to buy round-trip tickets to vacation spots such as Spain and then purchase tickets for their real destination once they arrive overseas, the FBI said. On March 26, Thomas purchased a ticket to Barcelona, with a March 29 departure and an April 15 return to the United States, the complaint said. It's not clear when or where she was arrested. She was charged with knowingly attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. She could be sentenced to 15 years in prison. On Thursday, Noelle Velentzas, 28, and her former roommate, Asia Siddiqui, 31, were arrested in New York and accused of planning to build an explosive device for attacks in the United States, federal prosecutors said.

{"document":"Let's start with a pop quiz (space junkies can skip this test). True or False, Mercury is:. 1) The planet closest to the sun in our solar system. 2) So hot that water couldn't possibly exist there. 3) Something used in old-style glass thermometers. 4) A planet you don't think about very often. Answers: True, False, True (but not what we're talking about in this story) and I'm guessing No. 4 is true too. If you flunked the test, it might be because Mercury (the planet) suffers from bad (or very little) press. Or, maybe it's just bad lighting. Mercury orbits about 35,983,125 miles from the sun. Compare that to Earth -- we're about 93 million miles from the sun. Mercury's closeness to the sun makes it hard to see except at dawn and twilight. This may be one reason we don't think about it much. Venus, on the other hand, the planet between Earth and Mercury, appears to be the brightest planet in the sky. It's so bright it's been mistaken for an airplane. Pilot sends plane into dive after mistaking Venus for oncoming plane. But back to Mercury. It's getting some attention from the media now because it's about to get a visitor. The NASA spacecraft MESSENGER (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) is about to crash onto Mercury. The probe was launched in 2004 and traveled more than six and a half years before it started orbiting Mercury on March 18, 2011. Now, MESSENGER is running out of fuel and NASA says it will hit the planet's surface at 8,750 mph (3.91 kilometers per second) around April 30. You won't be able to see it hit because Messenger will crash on the side of Mercury facing away from Earth. There's no way to save the spacecraft, but mission operators at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, have been doing what they can to delay the inevitable. They've been using the little bit of fuel left on board to maneuver the spacecraft to keep it in orbit. They'll do one final maneuver on Friday, April 24. \"Following this last maneuver, we will finally declare the spacecraft out of propellant, as this maneuver will deplete nearly all of our remaining helium gas,\" mission systems engineer Daniel O'Shaughnessy said at a recent media briefing. \"At that point, the spacecraft will no longer be capable of fighting the downward push of the sun's gravity.\" But rather than mourn the loss, scientists held a briefing to celebrate the mission's success. \"For the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet Mercury that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. One of MESSENGER's big findings: It sent back data indicating that ice in Mercury's shadowed polar regions, if spread over an area the size of Washington, would be more than two miles thick, NASA said. It also took some amazing photos of the planet. So the MESSENGER mission is ending, but scientists say they'll be busy for years studying data from the probe. And if you want to see Mercury with your own eyes, you may be in luck if you can find an area with dark skies. It will be visible in the night sky just before dusk until about the end of May. Your favorite astronomy website will have some helpful guides.

{"document":"Over the years I\u2019ve been lucky enough to play with a lot of accomplished women golfers, including two former world No 1's in Lorena Ochoa and Laura Davies. But none of these encounters prepared me for playing 18 holes with Charley Hull, the best teenage golfer in Britain. Suffice to say: I knew she was good but I didn\u2019t appreciate she was so damn good. The venue was Turnberry and a media day for the Ricoh Women\u2019s British Open in July. The sun was shining, Ailsa Craig was shimmering in the distance and Hull put on a shot-making clinic. Charley Hull can make it to the very top of the women's game if she carries on her progression. Teenager Hull possesses the same \u2018wow\u2019 factor as world No 1 Rory McIlroy (below) One of the nice things for me about playing golf with the women pros is we usually hit the ball about the same length. Not on this day. Hull hit drives that pitched past mine. She positively exudes the \u2018wow\u2019 factor Rory McIlroy had at the same age. Like Rory, she\u2019s also easy company. Normally the way these things work is for the journalist to kick start conversations but Hull asked more questions than I did. She wanted to know everything about the course, from the historic role of the celebrated lighthouse to the war memorial that offers sober reflection to golfers on the back nine. The 19-year-old was keen to know about the revamp planned by the Trump family, who recently purchased Turnberry, under the guidance of course architect Martin Ebert. Again, like Rory, there\u2019s the requisite amount of steel. \u2018I\u2019d hit a five iron off this tee to stay short of the bunkers,\u2019 advised her caddy Gary Wildman, on the opening hole. \u2018No, I want to hit a driver,\u2019 replied Hull. She hit a driver. Indeed, she hit a driver off every tee, which is the way she likes to do things in practice. \u2018I just find taking on the holes makes me concentrate,\u2019 she explained. Again, like Rory, the driver also happens to be the best club in her bag. The 19-year-old has the same mentality and 'wow factor' as world No 1 Rory McIlroy. It puts her in the vanguard of the next revolution set to sweep the women\u2019s game. After the emergence of the Koreans and the revival of the Americans, get set for the power hitters to leave their mark in the same way their male counterparts hold sway in the men\u2019s version. Hull is part of a group that includes Thai rookie Ariya Jutanugarn and American Lexi Thompson. Hull has added 25 yards to her drive since hooking up with swing coach Matt Belsham earlier this year. Again, like McIlroy \u2014 there could be a theme here \u2014 her swing is so good she uses blade irons (she might be the only woman to do so), which are the preserve of the technically sound. American Lexi Thompson is another highly-touted golfer in women's golf and will challenge Hull. What\u2019s next for the girl from Kettering who plays at Woburn and who finished No 1 in Europe last year, the youngest to do so? She has now earned her privileges to play in America and clearly that is the next proving ground. Her plan is to be the best player in the world at 21 \u2014 the year McIlroy reached the summit \u2014 which might be a tall order given the present incumbent happens to be 13 months younger and won yet again in America on Sunday. Hull speaks in respectful tones about Lydia Ko.

{"document":"A restaurant boss is facing a lengthy jail sentence after he became the last of a string of men to be convicted of child sex offences against girls in Peterborough. Mohammed Khubaib, originally from Pakistan, befriended girls  and then \u2018hooked\u2019 them with alcohol - normally vodka - in an attempt to make them \u2018compliant\u2019 to sexual advances. The 43-year-old married businessman, who lived in the city with his wife and children, would pursue his interest \u2018away from his home and family\u2019, using his restaurant as a \u2018focal point\u2019. Scroll down for video. Convicted: Married businessman Mohammed Khubaib, originally from Pakistan, had a \u2018persistent and almost predatory interest\u2019 in teenage girls. Khubaib - who was convicted of the charges against him by a jury at the Old Bailey in five hours - had a \u2018persistent and almost predatory interest\u2019 in teenage girls, the trial heard. The father of five groomed vulnerable under-age girls by giving them money, gifts or cigarettes before plying them with alcohol. Following a trial he was found guilty of forcing a 14-year-old girl to perform a sex act on him and nine counts of trafficking for sexual exploitation involving girls aged from 12 to 15 between November 2010 and January 2013. His South African friend Manase Motaung, 32, was cleared of raping a 16-year-old and seven trafficking charges, involving six girls. Khubaib's conviction brings the total number of people to be convicted under Operation Erle to ten, of which five are of Pakistani origin. Khubaib was remanded in custody and warned he faces a long spell behind bars when he is sentenced on May 15. Eatery: Khubaib, who lived in Peterborough with his wife and children, would pursue his interest 'away from his home and family', using his restaurant (above) as a 'focal point' Judge Peter Rook QC told him he had been convicted 'of a very serious offence of a rape on a young girl... having plied her with vodka'. He added:\u00a0\u2018You have also been convicted of no less than nine trafficking offences in relation to under-age girls who you were deliberately plying with vodka so that you could take advantage of them, knowing they craved vodka so you could exploit them sexually. The Cambridgeshire Police investigation codenamed Operation Erle has led to a string of convictions for sex offences against girls in the Peterborough area. \u2018You must know the only sentence is a custodial sentence - and a long sentence.\u2019 The jury was deliberating for less than a day before it reached its verdicts. Four previous cases led to nine male defendants being jailed for 59 offences against 15 girls, from Peterborough, with a couple from Lincolnshire and Rutland. Mark Dennis QC, prosecuting, said the girls were vulnerable because of their age, background, circumstances or unsettled schooling and Khubaib pretended to be their \u2018friend and helper\u2019. Khubaib, who also ran a lettings agency, would drive girls to flats in his 4x4 and, once there, they would be groomed for sex by being \u2018plied with alcohol and entertained by himself and his friends\u2019. Khubaib raped a 14-year-old girl in August 2007 by forcing her to perform oral sex on him after she was given alcohol and then \u2018rewarded\u2019 with \u00a35, the court heard. The jury heard details of the trafficking allegations. Khubaib would buy one girl and her friends McDonald's meals and tobacco, as well as giving her small sums of money and a \u00a340 bunch of flowers for her 15th birthday, the court heard. He told the girl he wanted her to be his wife, saying that he would \u2018choose her over everyone else\u2019, while he told another 15-year-old she had beautiful eyes, the jury was told. When she rebuffed him, saying he was too old for her, he was said to have replied: \u2018Age doesn't matter.\u2019 Khubaib allegedly offered another girl \u00a360, telling her: \u2018You make me happy, I'll give you money.\u2019 Two weeks later he allegedly increased the offer to \u00a390. The girl refused. In January 2013, Khubaib picked up two friends - one aged 12 and the other aged 14 - in his seven-seater car and took them to a McDonald's, Mr Dennis said. The girls became uncomfortable when Khubaib got into a row on his phone and slipped away. Later that month, the defendants were arrested at a terrace house in Peterborough, where police found two girls aged 14. Khubaib said in police interviews that his association with all of the girls was innocent and he had not acted in any improper way, denying any sexual contact with the girl he is said to have raped. Motaung also denied wrongdoing by saying he had consensual sex with the rape complainant. Cambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council launched a \u2018victim-led\u2019 inquiry after identifying a number of young people who might have been at risk of sexual exploitation towards the end of 2012. The joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases. Nine Asian men from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, were jailed for a total of 77 years in May 2012 for raping and abusing up to 47 girls - some as young as 13 - after plying them with alcohol and luring them to takeaways. Two years earlier, in November 2010, five men from Rotherham in South Yorkshire were jailed after being found guilty of grooming girls as young as 12. Separately, a serious case review found last month that up to 373 children may have been targeted for sex by gangs of men in Oxfordshire in the last 16 years. Wendi Ogle-Welbourn from the council said: \u2018What was different in Peterborough is that having followed other places like Rotherham and Oxford we knew we must have child sexual exploitation in our city.\u2019 The two defendants, both from Peterborough, denied the charges. Following the verdict, Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway, of Cambridgeshire Police, said: \u2018I'm pleased with the verdicts today because not only does it acknowledge the seriousness of this behaviour but also the courage of the young people who were able to face their abuser in court.\u2019 He added that the investigation was more than two years old, and \u2018I do not underestimate the impact on some of the young people involved\u2019.

The joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases. A police spokesman said: \u2018We have made great efforts to safeguard these young people, win their confidence and explore what they told us. 'As a result of the information given to us, we launched a number of investigations. A police investigation formally began in early January 2013.\u2019 A number of the victims were in care at the time and had problems at home and school while the abusers' ethnicity reflected the local demographic - Portuguese and eastern European, as well as Asian\/Pakistani men. Khubaib's activities involved girls being befriended and then \u2018hooked\u2019 with alcohol in an attempt to make them \u2018compliant\u2019 to sexual advances. A mother has spoken of her pride after her teenage daughter \u2018kick-started\u2019 the police investigation into Khubaib. The teenager was targeted by him when she was just 14 in Peterborough. She saw him three times, but grew scared when he had an argument over the phone after taking her to McDonald's and decided to tell her parents, who took her to the police. Khubaib, 43, did not touch her - but had a \u2018persistent and almost predatory interest\u2019 in teenage girls, the Old Bailey heard. The girl's mother said the youngster found giving evidence at his trial \u2018worse than she expected\u2019 after her father broke down in tears when she went into the courtroom. She said: \u2018We keep telling her how proud we are. At one point she got very depressed and kept saying \"I'm stupid, I'm silly\". But we told her that, at the end of the day, she has helped so many girls. \u2018Luckily, nothing happened to her and she saw sense before it got any further - but she has helped so many girls and she should feel proud of that. \u2018There are many girls out there, even though they don't know her, they are going to be thanking her.\u2019 The woman said that the pressure of taking the matter to police had had a \u2018big impact\u2019 on her daughter. She explained that before meeting Khubaib, the girl was an outgoing tomboy who enjoyed being out with her friends and going to school. She said: \u2018After she told me and her father what had happened and we had gone to the police, she became a hermit.'\n","right_summary":"Married businessman Mohammed Khubaib convicted of raping girl, 14.

{"document":"West Ham are determined to ensure their season does not end with a whimper, according to defender Carl Jenkinson. The Hammers' once promising campaign has tailed off, with a run of just one win in 11 Barclays Premier League games seeing the club slip from Champions League contention to mid-table. Their latest disappointing result came at Manchester City on Sunday as they went down to an insipid 2-0 defeat. Carl Jenkinson holds off the challenge from Jesus Navas during West Ham's 2-0 defeat by Manchester City. West Ham defender Jenkinson challenges Aleksandar Kolorov during the clash at the Etihad on Sunday. With Europe now not realistic and relegation not an issue, the Hammers would now seem to have little to play for but Jenkinson insists the remaining five games are not meaningless. The 23-year-old, who has enjoyed a successful season-long loan from Arsenal and could make the switch permanently, said: 'People in our dressing room are fired up. If you came in the changing room after the game you'd see that. 'People aren't resting on their laurels, people ain't happy finishing mid-table. We want to kick on. We have got something to prove now because we have been on a bad run of games and we want to put that right. We owe that to ourselves and the fans.' West Ham were never in the game at the Etihad Stadium, losing after a bizarre own goal from James Collins and a swift counter-attack strike from Sergio Aguero before half-time. James Collins scored a comical own goal to give Manchester City the lead on Sunday. Enner Valencia and Kevin Nolan did have late chances after City lost momentum following injury to David Silva but they were generally lacklustre throughout the contest. Jenkinson felt the visitors paid the price for their mistakes but does not feel the team are much doing much differently from the early part of the season. He said: 'I wouldn't want to blame it on luck but a few things haven't gone our way lately and we have conceded some late goals. 'I think this was a different story - we made a couple of mistakes and got punished. Sergio Aguero doubled the lead for the champions as they ran out comfortable winners. 'Of course we have got to work on our performances but if you look at the last 10 games, our performances haven't been bad at all. 'We have had some really good performances but teams have scored late goals against us and we have ended up getting a point instead of three. It has been a bit frustrating. 'I just think early on in the season we were finishing everything. Everything we got was going in the back of net and at important times of the game. 'We have gone ahead in recent games but never killed the games off and have ended up conceding cheaply towards the end of the game. Of course that is a real kick in the teeth. 'It is not nice blaming things on luck - you make your own luck - but that has been the story of our last couple of months.'\n","right_summary":"West Ham were beaten 2-0 by Manchester City at\u00a0the\u00a0Etihad on Sunday.

{"document":"A cafe owner has laid down a challenge to diners with a gut-busting morning meal that contains a whopping 4,000 calories. Olly Taylor, 27, is offering his version the Easter Feast, which is stuffed with the equivalent of almost 100 teaspoons of sugar, at his Black Milk cafe in Manchester's Northern Quarter. The breakfast includes two types of cereal served in half an Easter egg, with brownies, marshmallows and mini eggs, topped off with three different types of flavoured milk. The Easter Feast breakfast is available at The Black Milk Cereal Cafe in Manchester's Northern Quarter. Up for the challenge: Customer Glen Keogh attemps the 4,000-calorie meal which has 388g of sugar. The meal is so sweet it contains the equivalent of 388g of sugar or 97 teaspoons. For \u00a37, customers looking to get their day off to a jittery start will be treated to a 291g milk chocolate Easter egg, with one half used as a bowl, served on a bed of baked and caramelised white chocolate to support the structure. Two cereals of choice are added together with a Creme Egg, a handful of Mini Eggs, home-made chocolate brownie and a Flake chocolate bar. Marshmallows and M&M's are thrown into the mix, before the whole dish is generously drizzled in homemade dulce de leche - an Argentinian take on condensed milk - and salted caramel sauce. He starts off in high spirits, pouring the first of the three milks into his chocolate 'bowl' Mr Keogh takes on the Easter Feast (left) \u00a0but barely gets through before he regrets his decision (right) Finally, customers are treated to three milks of choice which can be taken from a range including black squid ink milk, chocolate, strawberry, vanilla and good old semi-skimmed. Mr Taylor, whose cafe specialises in world cereals, milkshakes and cheesecake, says he has carried his fine-dining and knowledge of being a wine sommelier into Black Milk. He created the Easter Feast Challenge to celebrate the gluttony of Easter. Cadbury's chocolate egg (291g): 150g sugar; 1,400 calories. Baked caremalised white chocolate: 9g sugar; 80 calories. Kosher cereal from Israel: 8g sugar; 150 calories. Toffee crisp cereal: 7.2g sugar; 150g calories. Home-made brownie: 7g sugar; 410 calories. Creme Egg: 26.5g sugar; 177 calories. Mini Eggs: 20.5g sugar; 148 calories. Flake: 16.7g sugar; 171 calories. Dulce de leche: 50g sugar; 315 calories. Salted caramel sauce 10g sugar; 300 calories. Milks: 30g sugar; 300 calories. Marshmallows: 40g sugar; 75 calories. M&Ms: 13g sugar; 140 calories. TOTAL: 3,816 calories. Average man needs 2,500 calories per day. 'It's all in the spirit of Easter,' he said. 'Easter is less about what is used to mean, and now on Easter Sunday people try and go through as many chocolate eggs as they can, so this is another challenge for them. 'No one has managed to finish it yet but we'll be running it until the end of the Bank Holiday to see if anyone can.' He said the initial idea for the Easter Feast came to him after seeing soup served inside giant bread bowls in Paris and he wanted to transfer the concept to the cereal market. 'I want to push it further and come up with wacky concoctions and push the limits of cereal and milk and what you can do with it,' he said. Although his cafe may stake a claim to creating Britain's most tooth-rotting dish, Mr Taylor is keen to point out some of the shop's biggest sellers are muesli, Special K and protein granolas used as an after-gym snack. Sweet-toothed customer Glen Keogh bravely attempted the challenge, opting for Toffee Crisp and a kosher cereal from Israel as his two choices. He said: 'I absolutely love chocolate, so this seemed like it would be a doddle at first. 'After tucking straight into the Cr\u00e8me Egg, the Flake and the brownie, I realised even that was more chocolate than anybody needs to eat in one sitting. 'The cereal was delicious, but like the Easter Egg bowl once the milk was poured, I started to crumble. 'Ten minutes, an aching belly and fuzzy teeth later, I called it a day with just the bowl to spare. My nine-year-old self would have been disappointed, but he didn't have to pay to go to the dentist!'

{"document":"Charged:\u00a0Rejean Hermel Perron (pictured) has been accused of holding a woman captive for five days and subjecting her to multiple sexual assaults. A dog walker used nail clippers to free a kidnapped woman who police say was held prisoner and sexually assaulted by a Canadian man for five days. The 27-year-old sex trade worker emerged from a home in Toronto, Canada, bound by handcuffs, badly bruised and naked from the waist down begging for help. Peter Hamilton heard her cries as he was passing by and desperately tried to free her from her restraints. She told him that her kidnapper was still inside, but had fallen asleep. Mr Hamilton wanted to call the police, but had left his cell phone at home, forcing him to take out the only item he had on him - the nail clippers. Police claim Rejean Hermel Perron held the alleged victim at gunpoint on March 31 when she refused to go inside. He is then said to have held the woman for five days,\u00a0subjecting her to sexual assaults including 'ritualistic actions' that officers said they were 'unfamiliar with'. Detectives believe there could be more victims who have yet to come forward. The 43-year-old is alleged to have met the woman, in the Sherbourne and Shuter Street area of the city before the pair returned to his home. The National Post\u00a0reports that she became 'uncomfortable' and made it clear she wanted to leave. But he then allegedly produced the weapon and restrained her with duct tape and handcuffs. Police say she was subjected to multiple sexual assaults. Perron was arrested on Monday and later charged with sexual assault with a weapon, kidnapping, forcible confinement and assault. Describing the dramatic escape, Mr Hamilton told the CBC\u00a0how he was walking his dog in the Dundas Street East and Jones Street area when he heard desperate pleas for help. Hero: Dog walker Peter Hamilton heard the woman's cries for help before he saw her come out of the house bound by restraints and naked from the waist down. Quick thinking: He wanted to call the police but left his cell phone at home, so had to use the only implement he had on him to free the woman - his nail clippers. He said a woman appeared on a veranda of a home but could not move further because of the restraints on her hands and feet. She warned him her kidnapper was still armed and inside the home. Mr Hamilton told CBC: 'My first thought was 'how do I get her out of here?' 'I knew this was a dangerous situation. I couldn't leave her, but I could not go back to my house to get my phone.' When a man emerged from the home, Mr Hamilton stood up ready for a confrontation. But the man then turned and fled, it is reported. Mr Hamilton added:\u00a0'This is where it could have taken a turn for the worse,' said Hamilton. 'He came out and he ran. He saw us and he just ran and that was a very good thing.' 'She was very emotionally distressed and she said, \"I'm sorry I have to put you through this.\" There was nothing to apologize for. 'It's just the right thing to do. We live in a society where sometimes people turn a blind eye to what's going on around them.' In part, he has thankful for having his dog, as he wouldn't have been walking through the neighborhood for any reason. He told the Toronto Star: Without having that dog, I wouldn't have taken a walk through the neighbourhood, and if he hadn't taken a walk, he wouldn't have encountered a shocking crime in progress, and wouldn't have had the opportunity to intervene and possibly save a woman's life. 'Whatever fate or destiny comes into it, the dog has as much of a part. 'The horror of what happened to her, of what she had gone through, hadn't really sunk into me yet. 'What sinks into you is the horror you're seeing right now, which is that there's a naked woman on the floor in handcuffs who needs help.' After he contacted police, Mr Hamilton said he spent the day with his wife and went for a hike out of town. 'That was good. It calmed everybody down,' he said. The woman was rushed to hospital after passers-by called emergency services and is said to be recovering. Crime scene: After Mr Hamilton helped free the woman, a man emerged from the house, so they ran.

{"document":"Nasa has spotted an exoplanet 13,000 light-years away, making it one of the most distant planets ever found. Known as 'Ogle-2014-BLG-0124Lb,' the gas giant was detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Ogle Warsaw Telescope in Chile. The planet is half as massive as Jupiter and could help astronomers gain a better understanding of the distribution of planets in the Milky Way. Astronomers have spotted one of the most distant planets ever found. Known as 'Ogle-2014-BLG-0124Lb,' the gas giant was detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Ogle Warsaw Telescope in Chile.\u00a0Most of the planets we know about are around 10-100 times closer. The planet was discovered using a technique known as microlensing. This happens when one star happens to pass in front of another, and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify and brighten the more distant star's light. If that foreground star happens to have a planet in orbit around it, the planet might cause a blip in the magnification. Astronomers are using these blips to find and characterise planets tens of thousands of light-years away in the central bulge of our galaxy, where star crossings are more common. Most of the planets we know about are around 10-100 times closer than Ogle-2014-BLG-0124, claims Jennifer Yee of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. 'We don't know if planets are more common in our galaxy's central bulge or the disk of the galaxy, which is why these observations are so important,' she added. The discovery demonstrates that Spitzer - from its unique perch in space - can be used to help solve the puzzle of how planets are spread out in our galaxy. The planet was discovered using a technique known as microlensing. This happens when one star happens to pass in front of another, and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify and brighten the more distant star's light. If that foreground star happens to have a planet in orbit around it, the planet might cause a blip in the magnification. Astronomers are using these blips to find and characterise planets tens of thousands of light-years away in the central bulge of our galaxy, where star crossings are more common. Our sun is located in the suburbs of the galaxy, about two-thirds of the way out from the centre. The microlensing technique as a whole has yielded about 30 planet discoveries so far, with the farthest residing about 25,000 light-years away. 'Microlensing experiments are already detecting planets from the solar neighborhood to almost the center of the Milky Way,' said co-author Andrew Gould of The Ohio State University, Columbus. 'And so they can, in principle, tell us the relative efficiency of planet formation across this huge expanse of our galaxy.' This infographic explains how the Spitzer Space Telescope can be used in tandem with a telescope on the ground to measure the distances to planets. The planet was dicovered via microlensing which happens when one star passes in front of another, and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify the more distant star's light. Microlensing complements other planet-hunting tools, such as the Kepler mission, which has found more than 1,000 planets closer to home. But it faces one key problem: This method can't always precisely narrow down the distance to the stars and planets being observed. While a passing star may magnify the light of a more distant star, it rarely can be seen itself, making the task of measuring how far away it is challenging. Of the 30 planets discovered with microlensing so far, roughly half cannot be pinned down to a precise location. The result is like a planetary treasure map lacking in X's. That's where Spitzer can help out, thanks to its remote Earth-trailing orbit. Spitzer circles our sun, and is currently about 128 million miles (207 million km) away from Earth.\u00a0That's farther from Earth than Earth is from our sun. When Spitzer watches a microlensing event simultaneously with a telescope on Earth, it sees the star brighten at a different time, due to the large distance between the two telescopes and their unique vantage points. This technique is generally referred to as parallax. 'Spitzer is the first space telescope to make a microlens parallax measurement for a planet,' said Yee. Data from the microlensing event is seen here. \u00a0If the foreground star is circled by a planet, the planet's gravity can alter the magnification over a shorter period, seen in the plot in the form of spikes and a dip. 'Traditional parallax techniques that employ ground-based telescopes are not as effective at such great distances.' Using space telescopes to observe microlensing events is tricky. Ground telescopes send out alerts to the astronomy community when an event starts, but the activity can quickly fade, lasting on average about 40 days. In the case of the newfound planet, the duration of the microlensing event happened to be unusually long, about 150 days. Both Spitzer and Ogle's telescopes detected the telltale planetary blip in the magnification, with Spitzer seeing it 20 days earlier. This time delay between viewing of the event by Ogle and Spitzer was used to calculate the distance to the star and its planet. Knowing the distance allowed the scientists also to determine the mass of the planet, which is about half that of Jupiter. 'We've mainly explored our own solar neighborhood so far,' said Sebastiano Calchi Novati, a Visiting Sagan Fellow at Nasa's Exoplanet Science Institute. 'Now we can use these single lenses to do statistics on planets as a whole and learn about their distribution in the galaxy.'\n","right_summary":"Most of the planets we know about are around 10-100 times closer.

{"document":"The world's seventh-largest economy is heading toward collapse. An economic powerhouse conservatively valued at $24 trillion, one that annually churns out the equivalent of $2.5 trillion, is under assault. However, I am not referring to one of the G8 economies, but to the \"super economy\" of the ocean. It's one that for far too long has been ignored and taken for granted -- and it is going downhill fast. The health and wealth of the ocean are assessed in a WWF report released Thursday, Reviving the Ocean Economy. The report is the result of a hard economic analysis performed by The Boston Consulting Group built on a foundation of the latest ocean science provided by the Global Change Institute of the University of Queensland. True, the enormity of the ocean can complicate any single appraisal. But it is still important to try to understand its value if global leaders are ever going to sustain it for future generations. The fact is that the ocean feeds us, employs us, offers protection and plays a direct role in the lives and livelihoods of people throughout the world. The ocean also provides intangible but essential services to humanity, such as climate regulation and oxygen production, that are difficult to put in monetary terms. And while we all may look at the ocean from different perspectives, no one can escape the fact that it is a shared resource that provides for each and every one of us. A figure that may get lost in the headlines generated by our report is perhaps most telling: Seventy percent of the ocean's overall economic value relies on its continued health. Ocean assets like fisheries, coral reefs, mangroves and seagrasses that produce goods and services rivaling the world's top 10 economies will lose their value if we continue to over-exploit and outright destroy them. That may seem like a far-off possibility to some, but it is a future foretold by the many details in this report. For example, 90 percent of the world's fish stocks are either fully exploited or over-exploited. And that is not all. By 2050 -- only a few decades from now -- it is possible that the ocean could lose its coral reefs, which have already been halved in the last few decades. This isn't just a concern for dive enthusiasts, but to the hundreds of millions of people that rely on ocean resources for their daily meals and their weekly paychecks. The ocean is truly too big to fail. The loss of the ocean's critical habitats and species would have a devastating ripple effect on global food security and economies that no government bailout could salvage. Fortunately, our report identifies actions that would revive the ocean economy, three of which are critical this year. First, the international community must rally around a set of sustainable development goals that clearly reflect the link between the environment -- including the ocean -- and human well-being. Also, negotiators meeting in Paris later this year must agree on an ambitious global climate deal that sets us on the path to avert the worst impacts of climate change. And finally, leaders must commit to conserving increasing amounts of coastal and marine areas over the course of the next 15 years. The economic case for why the ocean is so critical to livelihoods around the world is clear, and we will not be able to plead ignorance if we collectively preside over the collapse of the ocean economy. Reviving the Ocean Economy is dedicated to helping us avoid that outcome, but it will require political vision and courage among policymakers. All this said, and as terrifying as it is that the deterioration of the ocean's health has been its fastest in millions of years, there is actually some (potential) good news: If we act swiftly and with determination, marine resources can recover -- and recover quickly. Many local examples -- from the Mediterranean to the Mozambique Channel, from the Fiji archipelago to the Arctic -- show us that conservation, restoration and sustainable-use approaches mean the ocean, and the people who depend on it, can both prosper. Ultimately, the ocean bridges continents, connects cultures and offers equal opportunity inspiration and we should therefore work together in support of this vital shared resource. But if we are to have any chance of avoiding the point of no return, we must find ways of reaching genuine global commitments on sustainable development and climate. After all, it's far better to avoid an economic collapse than be forced to scramble to pick up the pieces.\n","right_summary":"Ocean economic powerhouse valued at $24 trillion: WWF report.

{"document":"Craig Hicks, who is charged in the deaths of three Muslim college students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, earlier this year, can face the death penalty, a judge ruled Monday, according to CNN affiliates. Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson Jr. ruled that Hicks' case is \"death penalty qualified,\" WRAL and WTVD reported. The 46-year-old was arrested February 10 in the deaths of Yusor Mohammad, 21, her 23-year-old husband, Deah Shaddy Barakat, and 19-year-old sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. All three were shot in the head. Hicks, who was the victims' neighbor, turned himself in to police the night of the killings. The next week, he was indicted on three counts of first-degree murder and a count of discharging a firearm into an occupied dwelling. He had no prior criminal record, police said. Police said \"an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking\" might have been a factor in the shootings but also said they weren't dismissing the possibility of a hate crime. On what is believed to be Hicks' Facebook page, numerous posts rail against religion. The victims' family members have called on authorities to investigate the slayings as a hate crime. The U.S. Department of Justice issued a statement in February saying the department's Civil Rights Division, along with the the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of North Carolina and the FBI, have opened \"a parallel preliminary inquiry\" to determine whether any federal laws, including hate crime laws, were violated. \"It has always been our position that Mr. Hicks should be held responsible for his actions to the full extent of the law. His killing of three college students was despicable, and now he must face the consequences of his actions,\" said Rob Maitland, an attorney for Hicks' wife. Karen and Craig Hicks are in the process of divorce.\n","right_summary":"Hicks is charged in the deaths of three Muslim college students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

{"document":"There was uproar on the south coast when Nicola Cortese sacked local hero Nigel Adkins and replaced him with the relatively unknown Argentine, on English shores at least, Mauricio Pochettino. Adkins had led Southampton to back-to-back promotions into the Barclays Premier League and was fighting valiantly to keep them in it. But Cortese\u2019s decision proved to be an astute one and Pochettino took them to the next level. He increased intensity in training and in matches, altered their style of play, continued their already excellent emphasis on youth and made some shrewd signings. Mauricio Pochettino spent 16 months as Southampton manager before departing to Tottenham. The Argentine manager (right) embraces Ronald Koeman (left) as he took on his former side in October. So much so that 16 months later Daniel Levy saw him as the ideal man to take Tottenham on, too. As Pochettino prepares to return to St Mary\u2019s for the first time since he left, Sportsmail takes a look at how his two tenures compare. YOU DON\u2019T WIN ANYTHING WITH KIDS\u2026. Pochettino came to England with a reputation for bringing through young players - at Espanyol he handed 25 of their youth products a debut. At Southampton he continued to show no fear in throwing them in, giving Premier League debuts to Calum Chambers, who then moved to Arsenal for \u00a316million and has now won senior England caps, and James Ward-Prowse, who is a first-team regular, star of England Under 21s and set for a call up by Roy Hodgson. Pochettino has maintained that approach at Tottenham. He was the first, of many managers who came before, to give Ryan Mason a proper run in the team and this season the player earned a first England cap for his displays. Calum Chambers (left) and James Ward-Prowse (right) both rose to prominence under Pochettino. Harry Kane has flourished under him, too, already around the first team before his arrival albeit, but excelling under Pochettino\u2019s guidance and scoring a sensational 31 goals in all competitions already this season. Nabil Bentaleb is another who has progressed under Pochettino after Tim Sherwood gave him a chance last season, while Pochettino also gave Harry Winks, a 19-year-old midfielder, his first appearance from the bench in the Europa League. Harry Kane has been in sensational form under the former Saints boss this season - scoring 31 times. 2011-12 : 4th (Harry Redknapp as manager) 2012-13 : 5th (Andre Villas-Boas as manager) 2013-14: 6th (Tim Sherwood as manager) 2014-15 *currently 7th (Mauricio Pochettino) LUNG-BUSTING TRAINING. Training sessions under Pochettino have become almost mythical. Speak to any player who has worked under him and they all recall gruelling double and triple sessions, all throughout pre-season and maintained regularly during the campaign. At Southampton when he first arrived he took the team to a Portuguese boot camp and made the players, leading himself by example, walk over hot coals. Not satisfied by their fitness levels, during that first pre-season there would be frequent triple sessions, from 10am-midday, from 2pm-4pm and from 6pm-8pm. During the season, in a typical week he would insist on hard sessions on Tuesdays and Wednesday - often double or triple. On the pitch, it got results. Mauricio Pochettino (left) has deployed strict and grueling training methods at both Spurs and Southampton. It appears there is more of the same at Spurs. \u2018There\u2019s not been a good moment in pre-season, if I\u2019m honest,\u2019 Harry Kane said earlier this season. \u2018There were double sessions, times when you were pushing yourself to the limit, but you\u2019re doing it for a reason. This is the reason that you\u2019re seeing now.\u2019 Team-mate Moussa Dembele echoed that sentiment, adding: \u2018The training sessions are hard, we feel already that we have become more and more fit and that\u2019s very good for us.\u2019 PASSING AND PRESSING PHILOSOPHY. Like many managers, Pochettino has a certain philosophy and is relentlessly demanding that it is reflected on the pitch. At goal kicks the centre halves drop wide around the penalty area, the full backs push 40 yards up the pitch and one of the two central midfielders moves to the edge of the box, giving the goalkeeper options to pass everywhere. A passing and pressing philosophy has been deployed by Pochettino throughout his managerial career. When they are not in possession, pressing is expected high up the pitch - hence the punishing pursuit of supreme fitness levels in training. Tottenham players have taken a while to get used to it, longer than it took Southampton players when Pochettino was first in charge. But there have been signs, when they were beaten once in 10 games and were challenging for the Champions League, that it can work there. ENHANCING INDIVIDUALS. In Pochettino\u2019s role as \u2018head coach\u2019 as opposed to all-round manager he has more time to work with individuals, if they go to him desiring to improve their game. Two of Southampton\u2019s current stars, Jay Rodriguez and Nathaniel Clyne, credit the 43-year-old for their progression. \u2018He brought the best out of me and gave me self-belief,\u2019 Rodriguez said after his departure. \u2018To work with him was brilliant, it was hard work but the lads loved it and we got results. Nathaniel Clyne (left) has credited Pochettino for his development while he was in charge. Jay Rodriguez says Pochettino gave him the 'self belief' to develop as a player. \u2018His tactical awareness gave you confidence, you wanted to go out for him because he\u2019s such a great guy. You can talk to him. The players respected him so much.\u2019 Clyne said: \u2018He\u2019d have us pressing high, keeping a high line, receiving the ball in difficult situations, keeping possession and basically having the confidence to play football rather than being afraid. 'The understanding in our defence was down to our training. Personally, it took my game to another level.\u2019 UNPROVEN TRANSFER RECORD. The transfer success-rate at both clubs has been similar; solid but not outstanding. At Southampton he made very few - Dejan Lovren proved a snip at \u00a38.5m and was sold on for double that. Victor Wanyama seemed pricey at \u00a312.5m but is one of their most consistent performers and will turn a profit if he moves on soon. Dani Osvaldo cost \u00a315m and ended up attacking a team-mate. Victor Wanyama was a big-money signing from Pochettino, but has turned out to be a success. Equally, at Spurs Eric Dier at \u00a34m looks like a future England international, whereas Ben Davies for \u00a310m could prove too much. Teenager Dele Alli is likely to be a steal at \u00a35m. The others - Michel Vorm, Deandre Yedlin, Federico Fazio and Benjamin Stambouli - are yet to shine. BROKEN ENGLISH. Pochettino would barely ever speak to the press - in TV, radio or to print journalists - in English while he was at Southampton. They employed translator David Salas. Yet occasionally when he was talking after pre-match press conferences, with the cameras and microphones off, he would talk in perfectly understandable English. At Tottenham from the very start he conducted entire press conferences in English and has trusted assistant Jesus Perez to occasionally turn to for help with any misunderstanding. The Spurs boss has spoken in English in his entire press conferences at Tottenham.\n","right_summary":"Mauricio Pochettino returns to former side Southampton for the first time since leaving last summer. The Tottenham boss done an excellent job during his 16 month spell. The Argentine manager has adopted the same methods at Spurs as he did during his time at St Mary's. Pochettino blooded the likes of Calum Chambers and James Ward-Prowse while at Southampton, and has done the same with Harry Kane at Spurs. His passing and pressing\u00a0philosophy\u00a0has taken a while for his new set of players to adjust to, though.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Former Southampton manager, Nigel Adkins, was sacked and replaced with Argentine manager Mauricio Pochettino, who led the team to a Premier League title. Pochettino enforced tough and grueling training sessions which led to Southhampton's impressive results. He has also been successful at Tottenham, where he has continued to stress youth development and deployed a passing and pressing philosophy. Although his transfer record has been solid, his broken English made communication difficult at Southampton, where he employed a translator."}
{"document":"They're supposed to be the ones who take the rubbish away. But in one residential street, a local refuse collector has been exposed as a rogue litterer, dumping plastic bin bags in an alleyway. His antics were captured on CCTV installed by frustrated residents in Oldham, Manchester, who had noticed the rubbish piling up. Residents confused over who had been dumping bags full of rubbish in an alley next to their street were stunned when CCTV revealed a binman. Rather than load the bags into his lorry, the bin man was filmed lifting them out of dustbins along Park Road in Glodwick before tossing them down an alley. Another CCTV video shows council workers arriving in the same alleyway days later. They searched the contents of the bags before placing stickers on each of them warning residents they could face fines of up to \u00a350,000 for not having disposed of rubbish properly. It was captured on video installed by resident Zed Liaqat who, along with others on the street, thought one of their neighbours had been dumping the bags there. 'For at least a year now we have had an issue with rubbish bags\u00a0being dumped in the alleyway,' said Mr Liaqat. 'There is always a pile of them there, cars drive over them because it is\u00a0quite a busy passageway and the bags end up splitting and rubbish flies\u00a0everywhere. 'For all this time I, along with fellow residents, assumed it was one of\u00a0our neighbours and it has actually caused a bit of tension because we\u00a0thought someone was doing this on their own doorstep.' The footage showed the binman lifting the bags out o wheelie bins before throwing them to the side. Adnan Islam's father had been sent a letter by the council inviting him to a recorded interview over the issue before the CCTV was obtained. After watching the footage Mr Liaqat was shocked to discover it had been council workers that were fly-tipping all along. 'When I watched it I was gobsmacked, it was a binman. You would have never thought it would be the people who are supposed to\u00a0take the rubbish away. 'As a community we are shocked, something has to be done about this.' Some of the residents had been sent letters threatening legal action if the rubbish was not cleared up. Adnan Islam, who also lives on Park Road, revealed how his dad received such letter which invited him to a taped interview at Oldham Council Offices with a view to having the matter dealt with in magistrates' court. 'This has really worried my dad. The letter mentions court\u00a0and says he will be arrested if he doesn\u00b9t attend the interview,' said Mr Islam. 'After watching the video I have no doubt this is why my dad has been\u00a0accused. 'When I saw the video I was stunned. We take pride in our area so we want\u00a0answers.' Local councillor Arooj Shah said 'individuals' such as those shown in the video 'ruin it for everyone'. An Oldham Council spokesman said the issue was being dealt with 'extremely seriously'. 'Our staff\u00a0must also lead by example. We are taking this matter extremely seriously and investigating it. 'We\u00a0will not hesitate to take appropriate disciplinary action, where necessary,'\u00a0Helen Lockwood, Oldham Council\u00b9s executive director for co-operatives and\u00a0neighbourhoods, said.

{"document":"Teachers complained they are now expected to be 'frontline stormtroppers' in the fight against Islamist extremism in school, a conference has heard. They said they are now being forced to spy on children during sensitive discussions as a result of new-counter terrorism rules. The National Union of Teachers (NUT) suggested that Government strategies designed to tackle extremism and terrorism have instead 'shut down debate' in schools. Teachers said they now feel nervous discussing controversial issues over fears they will be pressured to report youngsters who share their opinions. They also claimed young people  feel unable to express there views on certain subjects, such as the Charlie Hebdo killings, for fear of being branded an extremist. Scroll down for video. Christine Blower, NUT general secretary, said there is a need keep a 'safe space' for discussion. Jan Nielsen, an NUT member from Wandsworth, south-west London, said: 'We have to be clear that we are being put in the position where we are really being expected to be the frontline stormtroopers, who listen, who spy, and notify the authorities about students that we may be suspicious of.' The conference heard an example of a student being pulled aside after prayers one Friday because children coming out of the prayer room were talking about extremism, despite the fact that the boy had put a strong argument against joining jihadi groups. In another case, a boy who applied to go to Pakistan to visit his dying grandfather had his laptop taken from him and searched, with three potential examples of the youngster viewing jihadi websites found. When the pupil was questioned, he asked how he could argue against something if he did not understand it. In response, the pupil's non-Muslim classmates questioned why they would not be seen as suspicious if they applied to visit their grandparents in Holland, the conference was told. Delegates at the annual conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, raised concerns about the move to require schools to promote fundamental British values as well as the Government's Prevent strategy, which is aimed at tackling extremism. The strategy suggests school staff can help to identify and refer youngsters whose behaviour suggests that they are being drawn into extremism or terrorism. Alex Kenny, of the union's executive, described Prevent as a 'blunt instrument that will do damage and inhibit debate in schools', adding that Ofsted should be allowed 'nowhere near these issues'. Ofsted now checks that schools are actively promoting British values like tolerance and democracy as part of regular inspections. In the wake of attacks on the Charlie Hebdo journalists there were, in some schools, Muslim pupils who did not feel they could say they were offended by the newspapers cartoons. Mr Kenny said: 'We live in a damaged and volatile world, and like us, young people are trying to make sense of it, like us, they're trying to come to conclusions about cause, effect and solutions, and like us they want a space to discuss it. 'Schools are places where that discussion, on ethical and political issues should take place, in an environment of enquiry, and it may be an environment where young people say things we don't like, or say things that concern us that we want to address with them, that we want to discuss with them. 'But Prevent conflates a notion of British values and an elastic notion of non-violent extremism that is shutting down that debate.' He added: 'We have measures to deal with safeguarding, we have child protection measures, we don't need Prevent and we don't need to involve the police as the first instance. 'We are hearing young people telling teachers that they don't want to discuss things, that they don't want to discuss what happened with the Charlie Hebdo shootings, young people who were offended by the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, but saying they don't want to say it in class, they don't want to say it in schools. The conference heard that Prevent was shutting down debate in schools. 'Prevent is shutting down debate and we must oppose it and we must say schools are places where children and teachers should be allowed to discuss these issues.' To loud applause, delegates passed a resolution which includes an amendment calling on conference to confirm it believes 'that schools should be places where young people can discuss events in a spirit of enquiry and openness, and that teachers are well-placed to facilitate such discussions and deal with the expression of unacceptable viewpoints'. A Conservative spokesman said: 'Teaching about the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and tolerance and respect for others is part of our promotion of British values, and is at the heart of what every school has to deliver for children. 'We want all schools to promote these values throughout the curriculum, not just as a bulwark against extremism, but as a vital part of preparing young people to get on in life.' He added: 'Our guidance makes it clear that no teacher or school leader should feel unable to talk about difficult or sensitive issues - indeed teaching about fundamental British values actively encourages such discussions - but no-one should be using a school to promote views, opinions or beliefs that discriminate against other people on the basis of their background.'\n","right_summary":"National Union of Teachers discuss Government\u00a0strategies\u00a0on extremism.

{"document":"Veteran actor Robert Hardy is selling his enormous collection of antiques in a \u00a3100,000 auction after deciding to downsize his home. The star, known for appearing in All Creatures Great and Small and playing Winston Churchill several times, is auctioning off more than 200 items he has collected over his career. Mr Hardy, 89, is a keen military historian who studied English with J.R.R. Tolkien and is now an expert on the medieval longbow. Sale: Actor Robert Hardy is selling off his collection of antiques including a diorama of the Battle of Agincourt. Cabinets: A pair of early Victorian items of furniture made by Gillows of Lancaster which are set to fetch up to \u00a34,000 at the auction on Saturday. Portrait: A painting of Mr Hardy holding a longbow, reflecting his interest in medieval history. One of the most unusual items featured in the auction of his possessions is a hand-painted limewood diorama depicted the progress of the Battle of Agincourt in 3D. The piece was created by artist L.M. Rendall in the 1960s after being commissioned by Mr Hardy himself, and has an estimate of \u00a34,000 to \u00a36,000. There is also a longbow made from yew with a mother-of-pearl handle, as well as a portrait of Mr Hardy holding the bow, which is set to sell for up to \u00a32,000. The actor is also selling paintings, furniture, swords, flintlock rifles, silverware and a fine collection of crystal chandeliers. Diorama: The 3D model was commissioned specially by Mr Hardy from artist L.M. Rendall in the 1960s. Close-up: The piece was rendered in amazing detail showing the progress of the battle in 1415. Luxurious: A view of many of the items of furniture and other antiques which are being sold. Dozens of books, some dating back to the 17th century, are included in the auction which is set to take place this Saturday. A total of 238 lots are being sold by Dominic Winter auctioneers at its saleroom in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. Mr Hardy, who lives in the Cotswolds, said that he was sad to sell his collection. 'Downsizing and losing a great part of a treasured library makes for sadness,' he said. 'Entrusting it all to Dominic Winter and Co has taken away much of the pain, and through them I wish anyone who comes to possess anything that was mine as much joy and pleasure as it has given me through the years.' Historical: An early 20th-century painting of Alfred the Great rebuilding London, by Frank Owen Salisbury. Auction: The objects are being sold at Dominic Winter in Gloucestershire on Saturday.

{"document":"Twelve months ago, Liverpool were a free-flowing, potent attacking force with the SS (Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge) firing on all cylinders - the pair would eventually end up scoring 52 of Liverpool's 101 goals in the Premier League.This season, however, the goals have dried up. Replacing Suarez was always going to be a near-impossible task, but Liverpool fans would have started the season quietly confident that the quality was there to collectively make up for the Uruguayan's absence. Unfortunately for Brendan Rodgers, things in the final third have not quite clicked in the final third in the way they did last season. Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge (right) scored 52 Premier League goals for Liverpool last season. Raheem Sterling has struggled in front of goal this season, scoring only scored six Premier League goals. Jordan Henderson (centre) celebrates scoring sixth goal of the season, a penalty against Arsenal on Saturday. With just seven games of the season left Liverpool have scored just 45 goals - compared to 84 at the same stage last season - and their top scorers - Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and Steven Gerrard - have scored six goals each. To put that into context, only Crystal Palace (Dwight Gayle and Mile Jedinak - four) and Sunderland (Adam Johnson and Steven Fletcher - four) have top scorers with fewer Premier League goals than Liverpool. while Aston Villa's top scorers Christian Benteke and Gabriel Agbonlahor have also only managed six each. What the stats clearly show is that Liverpool have not filled the void left by Suarez, they are missing a Harry Kane (19 goals), a Diego Costa (also 19), a Sergio Aguero (17), even a Charlie Austin (16 goals) - and it has cost them dearly. Harry Kane (centre) didn't score against Burnley on Sunday, but has 19 Premier League goals this season. Diego Costa is the joint top scorer in the Premier League with 19 goals in his first season in England. Liverpool fans would argue that in Sturridge, who scored 21 league goals last term, they do have a player capable of scoring 20+ goals a season - and they are right. The England striker has had a frustrating season due to various injuries, and that is unfortunate, but Liverpool's others goal threats - Raheem Sterling, Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert - simply haven't met the standards set by the SS last season. Some may also argue that while Liverpool lack a single focal point in attack, the group as a whole have picked up the slack. That may be true to an extent but Kane and Costa have scored more than Sterling, Henderson and Gerrard combined. And there can be little doubt that had Sturridge remained fit all season he would have more than six Premier League goals by this stage of the season. The are mitigating circumstances for Liverpool, no doubt, but the stats don't lie and the fact that no one person has grabbed the mantle left by Suarez or Sturridge has proven costly for Liverpool - and may be a crucial reason why they miss out on Champions League football next season. Only Sunderland and Crystal Palace have top scorers with fewer Premier League goals than Liverpool this season. ARSENAL - Alexis S\u00e1nchez, Olivier Giroud. 14. ASTON VILLA - Christian Benteke, Gabriel Agbonlahor. 6. BURNLEY - Danny Ings. 9. CHELSEA - Diego Costa. 19. CRYSTAL PALACE - Dwight Gayle, Mile Jedinak. 5. EVERTON - Romelu Lukaku. 8.

{"document":"Diamond fraudster Anna Foord jetted around the world buying designer shoes and bags using cash she swindled from her victims. A diamond fraudster who jetted around the world buying designer shoes and bags using the cash she swindled from her victims is facing jail. Anna Foord, of Elstree, Hertfordshire, convinced investors to buy low grade gems overvalued by up to 2,000 per cent, a court heard. The 30-year-old even flew to New York to shop in Fifth Avenue's most exclusive boutiques using the money she made. She was part of a gang of fraudsters who lived lavish lifestyles by selling investors coloured diamonds in the \u00a31.5m 'boiler room' scam. But they were arrested and Foord was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering today while other members of the gang admitted similar charges. Foord was clutching a \u00a31,000\u00a0Louis Vuitton bag when police arrested her while it was later revealed how she had her collection of expensive Jimmy Choo shoes destroyed in an attempt to conceal the fraud. The court heard how smooth-talking salesmen convinced clients the diamonds were a better investment prospect than gold and would pay handsome returns. But in reality, the diamonds were 'what the miners leave on the floor' and the gang were using their victims as 'cash cows', the court heard. Prosecutor Esther Schutzer-Weissman told how diamond investors lost in excess of \u00a31.5m. 'The caller was persuasive, the caller was persistent and always suggesting to the investor that purchasing coloured diamonds was an investment that would get good and reliable returns,' she said. 'They were told often that diamonds would be scarcer and rarer and therefore more valuable because a mine, or mines, were closing or had closed. 'They were told this was a limited time opportunity and they were told that the investment was guaranteed to provide a good return, depending of course on how long the diamond was kept before selling on. 'Calls would be followed by letters that provided more concrete information about the investment prospect of the stones.' Shopping sprees of \u00a36,135, \u00a31,240 and \u00a31,726 took place at Selfridges and Harrods in London and Bloomingdales in New York, the court heard. One conman, Hider Eshpari, 28, boasted that he lived in a penthouse and drove a top of the range Audi A6 before duping a retiree out of \u00a315,500. The court heard one victim was told an orange yellow diamond's worth would rocket at Chinese New Year when demand for the diamonds increased and he bought it for \u00a314,450. But the gem was in fact worth just \u00a3440. Farouq Eshpari (right) was found guilty of money laundering while Safia Eshpari (left) admitted a similar charge. A jury unanimously found Foord guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering. Co-defendant Farouq Eshpari, 55, of Enfield, Middlesex, was also found guilty of money laundering. Farouq's sons, Omar Eshpari, 34, and Hider Eshpari, 28, admitted conspiracy to defraud before the trial while wife Safia Eshpari, 52, admitted money laundering. Omar is already serving a seven year sentence for a \u00a33million land banking fraud which preyed on elderly and vulnerable people. Co-accused Billy Cosma, 23, was unanimously cleared of conspiracy to defraud and defendants Anton Howell, 28, and Rommell Brown, 31, were also cleared of two charges each of conspiracy to defraud. Foord and the Eshpari family, all of Enfield, Middlesex, will return for sentence at Southwark Crown Court in May. Speaking after the case, Detective Constable Claire Bailey of the City of London Police, said: 'Boiler room fraud is a crime that destroys retirements and ruins lives. Farouq's sons, Omar Eshpari (left), 34, and Hider Eshpari (right), 28, admitted conspiracy to defraud before the trial. Shopping sprees of \u00a36,135, \u00a31,240 and \u00a31,726 took place at Selfridges and Harrods (pictured) in London and Bloomingdales in New York, the court heard. 'Victims were led to believe they were investing their savings in diamonds that could only increase in value and would provide them with regular and healthy dividends when in reality they were putting their money and trust in a carefully constructed scam designed to make the fraudsters a fortune. 'The City of London Police are very pleased this complex and extensive investigation has finally resulted in this organised crime gang facing the justice they deserve, something that I hope will provide some solace to their victims. 'We would also advise anyone who is contacted by a cold-caller trying to sell them something to simply hang up the phone and do not engage with this person on any level.' Speaking after the verdicts Rommell Brown, 31, spoke of his relief at clearing his name. 'The right verdict has been passed - the correct people have been found innocent and the correct people have been found guilty. 'I just want to say to the victims as well, I am sorry and I did work for those people in good faith and I am sorry for the losses that have been incurred as well - I truly am,' he said.\n","right_summary":"Anna Foord sold low grade diamonds at hugely inflated prices, court is told.

{"document":"A doctor who ploughed into an elderly couple in a 50mph head on crash while rushing to work has escaped prosecution after the police officer investigating the case went off sick. The female driver in a Toyota Aygo pulled in front of Colin Kay as he was driving his Citroen Picasso on the A586 in Great Eccleston in Lancashire last year. The collision was captured on film as Mr Kay had fitted a camera to his dashboard and revealed how he had no time to react and avoid the crash. Scroll down for video. Colin Kay captured the collision on a dashcam which showed how the Toyota Aygo driver veered across the road. The incident happened on the\u00a0A586 in Great Eccleston in Lancashire last year and Mr Kay provided Lancashire Police with the footage. After the incident last year, the doctor driving the Toyota also had to be cut from her vehicle and was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital by air ambulance. The 72-year-old was left with bruises after the crash and his wife Krysia suffered a whiplash injury to her shoulder. But despite having evidence recorded on his dashcam, Mr Kay has now been told there will be no further action because the investigating officer went off sick and they could not prepare the paperwork in time. The retired engineer from Bacup in Lancashire, said: 'I contacted the police because I was keen to see a full prosecution to stop more careless driving. 'But nothing has been done because the investigating officer went off sick and they could not prepare the paperwork in time. Mr Kay has taken his case to the IPCC after the driver who ploughed into his car will not face any further action after the investigating officer went off sick. 'I think it is disgusting. If I was off sick somebody picked up my work. She has just got away with it and that's that.' The pensioner has now contacted the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and sent them a copy of the footage after learning there would be no further action. He added: 'I have written to the IPCC and put my points across - it's not only my case not acted upon, how many others have not been acted upon?\" 'The only way our roads are going to become safer is when motorists driving carelessly like this are punished. Mr Kay with the footage on his computer. He says it is disgusting that there will be no action due the case not being picked up by another officer. 'My wife and I were very lucky that we were not more seriously hurt and we are very disappointed that no police action has been taken in this case.' After the incident last year, the doctor driving the Toyota also had to be cut from her vehicle and was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital by air ambulance. It is understood she did not have serious injuries. The grandfather-of-seven explained: 'We were extremely lucky. I have a pacemaker and I thought my chest was going to explode. 'We were both bruised right across where the seatbelts were. 'It is a miracle that no one was more seriously hurt given that it was a serious head-on smash at 50mph. 'I had very little time to brake because she turned right in front of me due to a lapse in concentration. \"I feared the worst afterwards because she was trapped in her vehicle but thankfully she was not badly hurt, and was cut out by the Lancashire Fire and Rescue.' A spokesman for Lancashire Police explained that there is a six-month period in which a prosecution would have to take place. This is the time limit set for summary offences, which are heard in a magistrates court to come to court. They also added that it was unfortunate that another officer failed to pick up the case instead. He said: 'Officers attended the scene and carried out a thorough investigation. 'An accident report was submitted with a recommendation for the driver to attend a Drivers' Alertness Course. 'Unfortunately, the officer in the case was off sick and the report was not processed within the allocated time frame for prosecution.'\n","right_summary":"Colin Kay was driving on the A586 when another car ploughed into his car.

{"document":"Fed up with Facebook, or coming to realise, in the words of David Cameron, \u2018too many tweets might make a t**t\u2019? It may be time to consider a short, sharp trip to the suburbs of Beijing. Here, in a collection of drab, concrete buildings surrounding a large courtyard is a military-style bootcamp designed with one thing in mind: to treat victims of a very modern disease \u2014 a compulsive addiction to electronic gadgets. Formed in 2006, the Daxing Internet Addiction Treatment Centre (IATC) has so far welcomed 6,000 mostly young, mostly male patients \u2014 and claims to have \u2018cured\u2019 75 per cent of them. Scroll down for video. Hooked up: With wires hanging from his head, a young boy undergoes electroencephalogram scans to measure brain activity. The centre believes internet addiction leads to brain problems similar to those from taking heroin. Online zombies: A line of dead-eyed Chinese youths play computer games at an internet cafe. The country's government said internet addiction affects 24 million of its 632 million internet users. Smart salute: At the Daxing Internet Addiction Treatment Centre, it\u2019s time to put down that mouse, pull on a camouflage T-shirt and learn to click heels, not screen icons. The man behind the facility is Tao Ran, a doctor and colonel in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, regarded as China\u2019s leading expert in wangyin, or internet addiction, which is said by the country\u2019s government to affect 24 million of its 632 million internet users. He describes wangyin as a form of mental illness, saying that 90 per cent of his patients are clinically depressed from a lack of normal social interaction. Many have back and eyesight problems due to spending up to 14 hours a day staring at screens, and a third suffer from eating disorders. \u2018Internet addiction leads to problems in the brain similar to those derived from heroin consumption but, generally, it\u2019s even more damaging,\u2019 Mr Ran said recently. \u2018It destroys relationships and deteriorates the body without the person knowing.\u2019 To break it, Mr Ran confiscates all electronic devices from patients and forces them to follow a super-strict, military-style fitness regime, starting with parade drills at 6.30 each morning. They must also endure occasional spells in solitary confinement and take regular medication. Progress is monitored by psychiatric assessments and regular brain scans. Mr Ran only considers someone cured if, six months after their release, they use the internet for fewer than six hours per day. Some critics have called the techniques brutal. But they also yield results and there is high demand for places: the IATC, which charges \u00a31,000 per month (more than twice the average Chinese urban worker\u2019s wage) recently expanded, so it can treat 130 patients at any one time. Work that body: Military-style drills, exercises and weekly tai chi sessions help the young addicts to shed their indoor pallor. Open wide: A nurse checks that 14-year-old Yin Yu Tao has taken his medication \u2014 all part of the \u00a31,000-a-month bootcamp. It isn\u2019t alone: there are around 300 such clinics in China, due largely to an explosion in the popularity of online games such as World Of Warcraft. Many internet cafes have beds, so customers can sleep at their keyboards, and Shanghai recently passed a law forcing parents to stop minors \u2018being overindulgent with online and electronic games\u2019. Meanwhile in Japan, where Facebook and Twitter are national obsessions, there are dozens of so-called internet \u2018fasting camps\u2019. Taiwan is also facing up to internet addiction \u2014 in January, its government voted to fine parents who allow children to spend \u2018excessive time using electronic products\u2019. Tough love: Good posture is required at the super-strict bootcamp. Here, pupil Zhai Ye is encouraged to stand straight. No rest for the internet addicted: The day starts at 6.30am and is run with military precision, even for this very young inmate.\n","right_summary":"Dax Internet Addiction Treatment Centre in Beijing has welcomed 6,000 patients since it opened its doors in 2006.

{"document":"'Gunman': Claudio Giardiello was described as 'very unusual' and 'over the top' by his former lawyer. A gunman has killed four people - including a judge and a witness - after going on a rampage at a Milan court where he was due to appear today accused of fraudulent bankruptcy. The defendant, Claudio Giardiello, 46, is said to have first killed his lawyer Lorenzo Alberto Claris Appiani, 37, and his co-defendant before shooting dead judge Fernando Ciampi  in\u00a0an act of revenge 'against those that ruined me'. Prosecutors said the attack was carried out with 'cold premeditation'. A fourth victim, understood to have been a witness, had no visible injuries and is thought to have died of a heart attack. Several other people suffered serious injuries in the attack, including Giardiello's former colleagues and accountant. After his killing spree, the gunman managed to evade police and fled the courthouse on his motorbike, reaching the town of Vimercate 15 miles from Milan before being arrested. Giardiello likely used a false ID pass to enter the court through a side door reserved for judges and lawyers, who are not obliged to have their belongings scanned by a metal detector, Milan public prosecutor Edmondo Bruto Liberati said. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said the attack 'a moment of great pain, of sadness' adding that it was 'unthinkable someone should be able to enter a court with a weapon.' He promised 'the government will shed the utmost light on the event' and described the police who had chased down and arrested the man as heroic. The gunman's attack began when he fired four or five rounds from multiple weapons at 11am. Witnesses reported barricading themselves inside their offices and taking cover under their desks as police hunted for the gunman. After texting loved ones that they were OK, employees and lawyers were eventually allowed to trickle out of the tribunal, women first, followed by the men who had their court ID cards checked. Gunman: Claudio Giardiello (centre) - the man who killed four people after opening fire on a Milan courthouse - is escorted by Italian police officers in Vimercate barracks near the city. Casualty: Rescuers and police help a seriously injured man out of the Justice Palace in Milan this morning. Several others suffered serious injuries in the attack, including Giardiello's ex-colleagues and accountant. Hundreds of people were eventually evacuated from the building as police hunted the gunman. 'There was a lot of panic at the beginning when people came running towards us saying there was a person with a pistol who had been shooting,' said lawyer Mirko Ricetti, who said he locked himself in a first-floor courtroom after hearing a shot. Police said Giardiello fired 13 rounds in total, beginning his rampage by mortally wounding his co-accused, Giorgio Erba, and killing his lawyer Mr Appiani. Another of his co-accused, Davide Limongelli, was injured in the gunfire. The armed assailant then allegedly sought out judge Ciampi, shooting and wounding another man on the stairs on the way to the floor below. He allegedly entered the judge's private office, letting off two shots that killed him instantly. Mr Bruti Liberati said it was not clear whether there was any relationship between the gunman and the judge. After his killing spree, the gunman managed to evade police and fled the courthouse on his motorbike, reaching the town of Vimercate 15 miles from Milan before being arrested. Giardiello was caught on video surveillance cameras fleeing the court and police traced him via his numberplate. Interior Minister Angelino Alfano later issued an update saying the suspect was arrested in a village 15 miles from central Milan away after fleeing the scene on a motorcycle. He subsequently tweeted: 'Caught in Vimercate the alleged murderess of Milan'. He told a press conference it appeared the man 'was ready to kill others in Vimercate,' following reports Giardiello had been heading towards another co-defendant, who was not present in court. Giardello, who reportedly had a string of failed businesses, allegedly told police: 'I wanted to take revenge on those that ruined me', according to Italian news agency ANSA. He owned 55 per cent of a real estate company which went under in 2008, media reports said. An ambulance with escort was seen leaving the Vimercate police station, but it was not immediately clear if the gunman was inside. Valerio Maraniello, who once acted as a lawyer for the shooter, told AFP his ex-client was 'an aggressive person, a little paranoid.' 'He was always convinced people were trying to cheat him. He never listened to advice,' he said, adding that he was 'not completely surprised' by the deadly attack. Hundreds of people were evacuated from the Palace of Justice building as police searched for the gunman. A plain clothes police officer helps to evacuate people from the tribunal building in Milan this morning. Leaders across the political sphere expressed shock that a gunman had managed to get into the court building. 'The fact that we're not talking about an organisation which surveyed the place first makes it even more perturbing,' said the head of the Lombardy region, Roberto Maroni. Alfano - in Milan for a meeting on public order and safety ahead of the 2015 Milan expo which opens in May - promised to investigate what he described as 'serious errors' in security. 'If this is the level of security in Expo Milan imagine what potential terrorists can think of doing,' said Matteo Salvini, head of the anti-immigration Northern League party. Judge Gherardo Colombo told journalists outside the court that he had known the murdered judge well. 'It's absurd that one can die like that, while you're doing your job,' he said, suggesting 'an anti-judiciary climate' may be to blame. The shooting immediately raised questions about how the man gained entrance to the Fascist-era courthouse with a weapon, given that visitors must pass through metal detectors. Heavily armed: Police snipers arrive at Milan's Palace of Justice this morning following the shooting. Security: Police cars surround Milan's Palace of Justice building this morning after a man named locally as Claudio Giardiello opened fire. Four people are thought to have died. The courthouse has metal detectors at the four main entrances, but lawyers and courthouse employees with official IDs are regularly waved through without the additional security screen and accredited employees can drive into the internal garage. Lawyers Mirko and Davide Pupo noted that the metal detector from the lawyers' entrance had been removed several months ago. Employees who emerged after the shooting suggested that the gunman could easily have gained entrance without passing through the metal detector by entering with his lawyer, though other lawyers said their clients are routinely told to go in via the public entrance. Deputy interior minister Filippo Bubbico said an investigation would determine who was to blame for any security lapse, given also that the gunman was not stopped as he moved from one floor to the next to continue the spree, and then was able to flee unimpeded. The Palace of Justice is in the historic centre of Milan, only a few streets away from the city's cathedral and shopping district.\n","right_summary":"Suspect Claudio Giardiello wanted revenge 'against those that ruined me' Judge Fernando Ciampi among targets killed with 'cold premeditation' Gunman 'used a fake ID to enter court through door reserved for lawyers' Arrested 15 miles away 'while seeking out another victim not in court'\n","hallucinated_summary":"The Milan courthouse becomes a bloodbath as gunman Claudio Giardiello opens fire on Wednesday.

{"document":"It\u2019s the changing face of Russian politics. When Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared on TV today to insist none of the country\u2019s troops are positioned in the Ukraine, he looked decidedly fresh-faced for a man accused of war-mongering. The wrinkles on the 62-year-old's forehead, clearly visibly in previous pictures, have disappeared, while his skin look smooth, taut, tanned and younger than ever. Vladimir Putin appeared on Russian TV today like you have never seen him before - leading to questions that he has had cosmetic surgery to get rid of the bags under his eyes, wrinkles and make his face more chiseled. His appearance this week is radically different to how he was previously pictured in 2007 (left) and 2010 (right). In both photographs the skin of Putin's face is more saggy, and he has visible dark circles under his eyes. And as this series of pictures show, the Russian president's face has changed dramatically over the years \u2013 amid persistent rumours he has undergone cosmetic surgery to give himself a more youthful look. A black and white picture taken in 1991 when he was 37 years old shows him looking gaunt, and black bags under his eyes are clearly visible. Putin, pictured in 1985 (left) with his wife Lyudmila and daughter Katya, and in 1991 (right) when he was chairman of the External Relations Committee of Saint Petersburg, aged 37. His hair was already receding. Pictures taken in 2000 (left) and 2001 (right), when Putin was in his forties, also show 'crow's-feet' on his eyes. During his first term at President in 2007 Putin, then aged 55, looked his age while still healthy. In a photo dated 2000, Putin\u2019s hair still has tones of blonde but the signs of ageing are becoming more apparent on his features. Fast-forward to 2010, and the 'action man', now 57, looks tired and haggared after taking part in a judo session. Questions over whether Putin had gone under the knife came to the fore in 2011, when the then-Prime Minister was photographed with a yellow bruise on his face. Russian media began to question whether Putin had had plastic surgery in 2011. Pictured here announcing his intentions to run to become the President of Russia, journalists wondered if that bid sparked the surgery. Putin's face was puffy but relatively wrinkle-free in December 2013 when he attended a conference in Moscow. Plastic surgeons at the time told MailOnline that Botox injections, a facelift, cheek-fillers, a brow lift and removal of the bags under his eyes would have helped improve his ageing features \u2013 although his spokesman denied at the time he had had any work done. But In the same year he announced he wanted to become the next President of Russia, leading commentators to ask if that was the reason behind his new look. In December 2013, after around two years in office as President, he looked vastly different again, his face puffy but wrinkle-free. And in March this year, the Kremlin was forced to deny rumours that he was unwell \u2013 or had undergone surgery \u2013 when the President disappeared for 10 days, cancelling a string of appointments and public appearances. Questions were raised about Putin's health when he met with the President of Kyrgystan last month after a 10 day disappearance. He refused to explain where he had been saying 'it would be boring without gossip' Putin, pictured on April 16 2014 - looking relaxed and youthful as he give a television interview about Ukraine. When he emerged to meet with the President of Kyrgystan\u00a0his face was puffy and shiny, and eyes only able to partially open, leading journalists to wonder about the cause of his new look. However Putin has remained tight-lipped about his absence, laughing off the suggestions of poor health - or rumours that he had been attending the birth of a love child - saying; 'It would be boring without gossip.' His latest appearance is unlikely to quell suggestions that Putin has been knocking on the doors of plastic surgeons.

{"document":"Since hitting the big time singer-songwriter Sam Smith has undergone something of a transformation. Over the past year the London-born artist, 22, has dropped three stone by following a dairy-free, low-carb and low sugar diet, and is now barely recognisable. The chubby, suit-wearing soul singer has gone and been replaced with a new body confident Sam, complete with designer stubble and a trendy new wardrobe. Scroll down for video. Sam Smith is looking better than ever after losing three stone over the last year, he regularly posts pictures of himself to his Instagram account. And his new fashionista status has been crowned with  Sam being named Vogue's April 'Today I'm Wearing' star. It's a coveted month-long role which sees the popstar share his outfits with the fashion magazine's readers each day. So far he's modelled looks including Topman skinny jeans, a custom Burberry shirt and a well-cut Emporio Armani cashmere jacket. The pictures reveal a newfound confidence in his slimline look, the result of a dietary regime by nutritionist Amelia Freer that has 'transformed' his relationship with food. Posting a picture of himself holding Freer's book Eat Nourish Glow on Instagram, the Grammy award-winning singer said: 'Three weeks ago I met a woman who has completely changed my life.' His diet has been so successful that he revealed that he even lost over a stone in just two weeks. Performing at the Brit awards last year Sam had a fuller figure and face. He continued: 'Amelia Freer has helped me lose over a stone in two weeks and has completely transformed my relationship with food. 'It's not even about weight loss it's about feeling happy in yourself. Love you Amelia & thank you for making me feel so happy inside and out @ameliafreer #eatnourishglow' In a previous interview with the Guardian in which Sam was described has having an appearance like an, 'HGV driver,' he said he would always struggle with his weight - despite his recent triumphs over the scales. Freer is an advocate of cutting out gluten and sugar (apart from fruit), processed food is a big no-no and every meal should include protein, fat and vegetables. She is against cereal and even recommends tucking into broccoli for breakfast. Almond milk, avocados and coconut oil are staples of her kitchen cupboards. Sam Smith is the star of Vogue.co.uk's Today I'm Wearing, posting pictures of his outfits each day. He kicked the month off with a Fred Perry T-shirt, an Emporio Armani jacket and Topman jeans. The quiff-loving singer models a vintage denim shirt, over jeans, brogues and a parka by Burberry, in his April 7 outfit photo for Vogue.co.uk's Today I'm Wearing... slot. Sam shared his weight loss journey on Instragram revealing that his newly svelte figure was down to nutritionist Amelia Freer. As well as changing his diet,\u00a0Sam is also reported to have taken up yoga and weight training to tone his frame. The singer, who claims he was very 'big' as a teenager, has said:  'I think I prefer food to singing.' He also admitted that he was self conscious about his body type, adding: 'I'm always going to have issues with my weight.' He also revealed in the interview that he felt that he had failed to become successful as a teenager because of his size. But the popstar seems to be making light work of his new regime and has been posting photos of his nutritious meals to Instagram. Sam posted this picture of himself to Instagram from when he was at school, making light of his bigger size. Sam has been seen out and about in recent months showing off his weight loss in some stylish outfits. Sam posted this picture of a delicious and healthy looking meal to Instagram after taking a nutritionists advice on his diet. Of course it is not unusual for a popstar to undergo a transformation after hitting the big time. Take, for example, DJ Calvin Harris who is practically unrecognisable from the straggly haired performer he once was. Over recent years the 31-year-old Scot, who is currently thought to be dating Taylor Swift, has got a smooth new haircut and a muscular physique. Sam's new look is certainly earning plaudits from fans. When he revealed his weight loss, one commented the picture: 'Hi Sam, you look really good! Keep up the good work.' And another said: 'You always look good and you are an awesome singer!' In his bigger days Sam would cover up in large over-sized jackets, however, he is now happier to wear more form-fitting clothes.\n","right_summary":"Musician Sam Smith, 22, has lost three stone over the last year.

And any parent who has tried this will know how tiring it can be when you then have to carry your child around once you arrive at your destination. A Swedish firm is hoping to make getting around with a young child easier - and save your aching arms - by introducing the bike seat that doubles up as a stroller.

{"document":"Cadbury has snatched two chocolate Fingers from its famous packs \u2013 reducing the number to 22. The move is the latest evidence of how the nation\u2019s favourite brands and supermarkets are cutting back on pack sizes without a corresponding cut in prices. The ploy means shoppers are being subject to stealth price rises in what economists have dubbed \u2018shrinkflation\u2019. Going down:\u00a0Cadbury has snatched two chocolate Fingers from its famous packs \u2013 reducing the number to 22. Now 114 grams: Cadbury chocolate Fingers have come down by 11g - the equivalent of two chocolate Fingers. In most cases, the price remains the same when the amount in the pack is cut, however in some rare examples the change comes with a price rise. Packs of Cadbury chocolate Fingers have come down by 11 grams \u2013 the equivalent of two chocolate Fingers \u2013 to a weight of 114g. While the popular biscuits carry the Cadbury brand, they are actually made under licence by another manufacturer, Burton\u2019s Biscuit Company, which is responsible for the changes. Burton\u2019s said it did reduce the wholesale price of the packs to supermarkets to reflect the lower weight, but it had no say over whether this was passed this on to customers. The price at Sainsbury\u2019s has risen from \u00a31 to \u00a31.50 over the past year, however it has come down from \u00a31 to 80p at Tesco, according to figures from the MySupermarket website. Last month, the Daily Mail revealed how the makers of PG Tips have reduced the amount of tea in its teabags \u2013 cutting the weight of a box of 80 by the equivalent of six teabags. From the archive: Boxes of Cadbury FIngers weighed 150g when this photograph was taken in March 2002. Makers: The popular biscuits are made under licence by another manufacturer, Burton\u2019s Biscuit Company, which is responsible for the changes. Its head office is pictured (above) in St Albans, Hertfordshire. We also detailed how the Kit Kat Chunky is less chunky than it used to be after it was reduced in weight from 48g to 40g. When challenged, the manufacturer, Nestle, claimed this was partly because of rising costs and partly because of its desire to help customers lose weight as its contribution to the Government\u2019s anti-obesity campaign. In the news: The makers of PG Tips have reduced the amount of tea in its teabags \u2013 cutting the weight of a box of 80 by the equivalent of six teabags. Tesco reduced the size of cartons of pasta sauce, such as Tomato & Mascarpone, from 375g to 350g yet the price remained the same and it was still promoted as serving two people. John West cut the size of its tins of No Drain Tuna Steak from 130g to 120g, but again there has been no corresponding fall in the price. Cadbury has something of a track record for shrinking packs in a move that protects its profits. It famously cut back on the number of cr\u00e8me eggs in its multi-packs ahead of Easter from five to six. Before Christmas, Burton\u2019s reduced its \u00a35 Cadbury Collection biscuits from 380g to 335g. In 2011, Cadbury reduced the size of the 140g bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk to 120g, so losing the equivalent of two chunks. It then cut the size of its traditional circular Roses tins from 975g to 850g \u2013 effectively snatching away 11 of the chocolate favourites. The firm was taken over by Kraft of the US in 2010 in a deal worth \u00a311.5billion, which has come under fire for a series of cost cutting measures that have undermined the historic British brand. The firm\u2019s American bosses have never been forgiven for reneging on a promise to keep open a Cadbury factory at Keynsham, near Bristol, when it took over the company. They have also come under fire for shifting large parts of their chocolate production to cheaper facilities in Poland. No corresponding fall in the price: John West cut the size of its tins of No Drain Tuna Steak from 130g to 120g. Which? recently highlighted a number of big brands that have been shrunk, such loaves of Hovis \u2018Best of Both\u2019 bread are down from 800g to 750g; Birds Eye Select Mixed Vegetables down from 750g to 690g; Aunt Bessie\u2019s Homestyle Chip are 50g lighter at 700g; and Philadelphia Light Soft Cheese is down 20g to 180g. The executive director at Which?, Richard Lloyd, said: \u2018Shrinking products can be a sneaky way of putting up costs for consumers because pack sizes shrink but the prices don\u2019t. \u2018It\u2019s now time for action on dodgy pricing practices that stops people from easily comparing products to find the cheapest.\u2019 The Food and Drink Federation said: \u2018Food and drink pricing always reflects the economic climate of the day, whether that\u2019s the impact of changing utility prices or ingredient costs which can be volatile. \u2018Businesses seek to offset these costs wherever possible through improvements in efficiency and productivity, but these actions can only go so far and in some cases companies will reduce the pack size rather than increasing the price for consumers.\u2019 Burton\u2019s confirmed the reduction in the pack size and insisted the chocolate fingers remain good value.\n","right_summary":"Packs of Cadbury Fingers have come down by 11 grams to weight of 114g.

{"document":"The parents of an 11-year-old autistic boy who miraculously survived four-and-a-half-days alone in the bush after he vanished from their favourite campground have vowed to continue holidaying at the camping spot. Luke Shambrook, who went without food or water since Good Friday, has been going to the Candlebark Campground at Lake Eildon National Park, northeast of Melbourne, since he was just one year old, his parents Rachel and Tim Shambrook revealed in an emotional press conference on Thursday. A desperate search for Luke in the park was mounted after he disappeared from the campground on Friday. The hunt ended on Tuesday when a police helicopter guided on-ground searchers to Luke's location. \u2018One thing in his favour is he has been going there since he was one-year-old, every year he\u2019s been up and down the hills and visiting the lake,\u2019 Luke\u2019s father Tim said. Scroll down for video. Rachel and Tim Shambrook thanked everyone for their efforts in helping to find their son Luke. Luke Shambrook's doctors are amazed he is in such a good condition considering he was missing without food and water for so long. His relieved mother Rachel added: \u2018He has a real sense of belonging there. I guess that gave him lots of confidence but ultimately that place gives him lots of pleasure and that\u2019s what we are on about regarding spending time there.\u2019 His parents believe the communities prayers and Luke\u2019s own resilience is what saw him survive the terrifying ordeal. \u2018Sometimes we don\u2019t give our kids enough credit for their resilience - but he sure showed us,\u2019 Rachel said. The moment Luke was found was captured on video, he was seen peering out from behind trees before a uniformed police officer reached him and took his hand to reassure him he was finally safe. Tim said: \u2018We admire everyone\u2019s professionalism, determination and commitment to finding Luke.\u2019 The 11-year-old autistic boy was found just three kilometres away from where went missing at Lake Eildon National Park - north-east of Melbourne. The Shambrook family with (left to right) Luke, 11, Lauren, 7, and Matthew, 10 and parents Rachel and Tim. Luke's parents revealed he has been going to the Candlebark Campground at Lake Eildon National Park, where he went missing, since he was just one year old. The couple vowed to take him back to the campground for more holidays.\u00a0\u2018He has a real sense of belonging there,' Rachel said. \u2018We were acutely aware of the thousands of prayers\u2026 we felt them,\u2019 Rachel said. The mother-of-three admitted: \u2018We found it difficult to keep our hopes up.\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s showed a side of him that we knew was there but his resilience has just blown us away,\u2019 Rachel said. \u2018To have such an amazing outcome it\u2019s hard to express it in words.\u2019 The parents are still at a loss to know how their son spent his long days alone in the Victorian bushland. \u2018If only we could have a snapshot of what his time out there in the bush was like\u2026 the concept of trying to understand what he did and how he survived is beyond what we can imagine,\u2019 Rachel said. \u2018We\u2019d like to have a glimpse of what he did at night.\u2019 Luke Shambrook was lost for four nights alone in the Victorian bushland and on Wednesday he was reunited with his rescuers at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. Doctors said on Wednesday they are stunned with how healthy Luke appeared when he was found. Sitting up in his hospital bed, the young boy was greeted by two people from the search and rescue team who made the dramatic find on Tuesday, just three kilometres from where he went missing at Lake Eildon National Park. Luke has been comforted by his family at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and after suffering from exhaustion, dehydration and hypothermia when he was found. He is unlikely to suffer any long term effects from his traumatic ordeal. A camera on the helicopter captured the dramatic moment rescuers reached Luke on the fourth day of an increasingly desperate search. A police officer was first on the site, and he knelt down and offered Luke reassurance he was finally safe. Other rescuers quickly followed, with one wrapping the terrified boy in a foil blanket, before he was gently taken from the bush to where he could receive proper medial attention. Paediatrician Amy Gray said Luke was still a bit weak and tired, but asking for food. His parents revealed he had eaten some Weetabix on Thursday and tasted his first Easter egg after completely missing the occasion over the weekend. 'It's an amazingly happy outcome after what has clearly been an incredibly stressful, traumatic experience,' Dr Gray said on Wednesday. 'I don't know that any of us know exactly what he's been through, but ... we think he's doing fabulously for someone who has been through what we can only imagine, and certainly in much better condition than what we'd expect.' Dr Gray said he was improving with each hour and doctors did not expect him to have any ongoing physical problems from the ordeal. 'Aside from the dehydration he's tired and weak, again as you would expect, but there's no other real major physical issues at this stage,' she said. Luke Shambrook has been found alive after he went missing from\u00a0the Candlebark Campground near Lake Eildon on Friday. He suffered from dehydration and hypothermia but has been reunited with his mother Rachel (pictured left) His parents Tim and Rachel were reunited with Luke as he was put into an ambulance in a stretcher, with his mother giving him a kiss. Luke was found just before midday AEST on Tuesday in bushland off Skyline Road, 3km from the campsite. 'He seems very content and settled in the ward and happily interacting with the family.' Luke's autism and limited speech could mean he never reveals what happened. 'He may have been wandering around lost and clocking up the k's,' Acting Assistant Police Commissioner Rick Nugent told Fairfax Radio on Wednesday. 'I'm not sure we'll ever know.' Mr Nugent on Tuesday said Luke's survival in the cold, wet, rugged terrain was a miracle. SES spokesman Brent Sergeant said the more days that passed during the search for Luke, the harder it became for volunteers. But finding the boy's beanie on Monday and realising he had walked away from water, rather than toward it, lifted their spirits. When his parents were reunited with Luke as he was put into an ambulance his mother gave him a big kiss. Luke gave his father Tim a 'big thumbs up' when they saw each other, the family said. 'When the rescue team found him, he was in high spirits and was walked out of the bush on his own two feet,' they said in a statement. 'The family are very happy to be reunited.'

{"document":"When most think of Ford, its ubiquitous Fiesta and Focus spring to mind. But in a bid to shed its image as the home of the mundane run-around, the company has launched its very own supercar. With the first models already shipped to China, the  GT, will be unrolled across Europe next year. While Ford has refused to officially confirm its price, bosses have indicated it will run alongside the \u00a3260,000 Lamborghini Aventador. To herald its launch, the company's design team have created a stunning light sculpture which showcases how they came about creating the prototype. Ford showcased its \u00a3260,000 GT in a stunning light installation in the heart of Milan as the first models are shipped to China. The light sculpture was unveiled in the  Piazza de Fidele on Tuesday as part of Milan Design Week. Planted in Milan's Piazza de Fidele, it walked through the steps of rendering to give insight into the car's conception. In the heart of one of the world's most design-savvy cities, many were surprised to learn the piece had been produced by car designers and engineers, said bosses. '(Having an artwork) is something new for us but really it combined everything that we do everyday,' said Moray Callum, Ford's Vice President of design. 'The model making, the technology - all of that was done in house so it's just taking what we do and presenting it in a different way.' 'We, generally, are a car company that talks to car guys but we wanted to reach a wider audience. 'We've had people approaching the installation and asking \"this is Ford?!\" which is just great. 'People were shocked that we were doing this and that's what we wanted to hear.' Alongside the modern artwork, Ford has released some of the first impressions of what the GTs interior will look like. The artwork was composed by Ford designers who worked on the concept for the \u00a3260,000 GT. The interactive installation was placed in Milan's Piazza de Fidele where it remained throughout design week. With its exterior a combination of aluminium and carbon-fibre, the compact two-seater has all the hallmarks of its ultra-sleek competitors. And earmarked at around the same price as the Lamborghini Aventador, the GT is a far cry from the much-loved models which keeps the company afloat. But despite a drive towards luxury, bosses insist the company is not trying to breakaway from its most reliable consumer. 'As long as I'm around, the mum on the school run will remain important - but design is important for her too,' added Mr Callum. Speaking at Milan's Salone de Mobile - an annual showcase of the world's leading furniture and light designers - he continued: 'Generally we are a car company that talks to car guys but we want to reach a wider audience. 'Design has always been important but we're finding you need to expand your audience.' The model was showcased for the first time at the International Auto Show in Detroit earlier this year (above) The car has up-swinging doors and 600 horsepower. It was unveiled in January in Detroit to a rapturous reception. The first images of the interior of the Ford GT have been revealed after 100 of the supercars were shipped to China. While the vehicle won't reach European markets until next year, bosses say they have been 'pleased' with the reaction the car. While the GT is priced out of most's grasp, another of its most advanced vehicles could be brought to the masses, he added. Ford's version of a driverless car is in the final stages of production with just safety legislation and measure standing between it and the open road. 'We have autonomous cars that we've been working on for the past 20 years in Detroit. A lot of the technology is there for about 90 per cent of driving,' added Mr Callum. 'What we're working on now is that extra 10 per cent which will take into account whether there are road works or if there's been an accident (and it's not registered).'\n","right_summary":"Ford unveiled its GT earlier this year to the surprise of industry experts.

{"document":"Steven Gerrard leaves his beloved Liverpool at the end of the season after an illustrious career and amazingly club legend Steve Heighway predicted that he'd be a success - in a newspaper article in 1992. The former England captain moves across the pond to MLS side LA Galaxy, where he embarks on a new challenge. A fresh-faced Gerrard was pictured in the paper at just 12-years-old, when he was an up and coming talent in Liverpool's academy. A young looking Steven Gerrard was pictured in the paper alongside the article written in 1992. 'Outstanding potential has to be recognised and nurtured and Stephen Gerrard, a gem from Huyton, could be the next on our production line. 'He has enormous natural talent and is a Liverpool fan through and through. His attitude to coaching and personal development is a joy to see and our staff are genuinely excited by his prospects. 'Stephen has already been brought to the attention of the FA National Coaching staff as \"one for the future\" and no effort will be spared to create the right environment for him and his talents to develop at this club.' Heighway, who played for the club for 11 years in 1971, highlighted the importance of 'nurturing' the midfielder and described him as 'outstanding.' The former Ireland player  was reporting on a game between England Schoolboys and Republic of Ireland and cast his eye over a young Gerrard, touting him as a next generation gem. He wasn't wrong as his prediction was the midfielder has gone on to make 499 appearances for his boyhood team, winning a number of major honours.

{"document":"Jeremy Hunt said a future Conservative government would look into the findings 'in detail' The Mail\u2019s revelations sparked outrage last night with all three major political parties backing calls for an inquiry. There was disgust too among frontline NHS staff and patients. The head of the Royal College of Nursing said nurses who had faced five years of pay freezes would struggle to comprehend the six per cent pay rise for their bosses. Patient groups said the packages were indefensible when patients were seeing spiralling waiting times and cuts to routine procedures. Professor Jane Dacre, president of the Royal College of Physicians, called for an independent review of top NHS pay while Professor Sir Brian Jarman, a senior Government health adviser, called for a public inquiry, saying bosses were manipulating the system. The main political parties promised an inquiry. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: \u2018A future Conservative government would ask the Department of Health to look at the Mail\u2019s investigation in detail. 'Too often high executive pay has been awarded as a matter course, not because of exceptional performance. Labour\u2019s Andy Burnham said: \u2018Labour will conduct a thorough investigation into this, as part of our plan to ensure pay fairness from bottom to top in the NHS. We have called for loopholes to be closed to prevent abuses.\u2019 For the Liberal Democrats, Norman Lamb said: \u2018NHS frontline staff will rightly feel that this situation is unfair. It is right to have an investigation so that these contracts are looked into so that we can make the best use of taxpayers\u2019 money.\u2019 Calling for an independent review, Professor Dacre said: \u2018Transparency in the NHS, including transparency of remuneration, is vital to ensure accountability to the patients we serve. An independent review would help to ensure that NHS CEO salaries are fair. \u2018It is important that we appoint high quality chief executives in NHS Trusts and their focus should always be on standards of patient care. They should be rewarded for the difficult role that they have taken on, but this should relate to the standard of patient care that they provide and the size of the organisation they run.\u2019 Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the RCN, described the findings as 'shocking' Sir Brian Jarman said: \u2018It is wrong. It is as simple as that. It seems to be manipulating the system. \u2018They should be putting their attention on to lowering their death rates or seeing if there\u2019s a problem with the quality of care rather than getting themselves higher incomes. That should be their priority. It is very worrying. \u2018It is something that should be investigated, absolutely, by the Department of Health. Or a public inquiry so you can subpoena witnesses and they must give evidence under oath and if they don\u2019t give evidence that\u2019s relevant they can go to jail for up to 51 weeks.\u2019 The country\u2019s foremost pensions expert, Dr Ros Altmann, said the figures showed executives were \u2018milking the system\u2019. She said NHS bosses were signing off their own pay rises and taking advantage of loopholes in the \u2018exceptionally generous\u2019 NHS pension scheme. She added: \u2018It is outrageous, it is so wrong. 'They think they can get away with it just because the law allows it. But morally it is questionable. \u2018It is like the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal. The rules would never have been intended to be used in this manner \u2013 they are meant for nurses struggling, who need to keep working to make ends meet. \u2018These executives are exploiting the rules for their own advantage. It is not acceptable. There should be independent scrutiny. The idea that senior executives can retire and come back to work to double-dip needs to be rethought. \u2018Taking lump sums and then re-employing themselves when there is evidence of failure \u2013 that needs to be challenged.\u2019 Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the RCN, said: \u2018At a time when NHS finances are in crisis, it is shocking that some NHS bosses continue to receive such vastly inflated financial rewards. Nursing staff will struggle to comprehend that their bosses have had an average 6 per cent pay rise when they are only getting 1 per cent this year, having seen their pay fall further and further behind the cost of living over the last few years. Norman Lamb for the Liberal Democrats said frontline staff would rightly find the revelations 'unfair' \u2018Senior managers such as chief executives do important and highly valued work, but they should not be getting disproportionate pay rises and bonuses while frontline staff continue to struggle.\u2019 Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said the revelations of \u2018misallocation of money\u2019 in the NHS required \u2018serious attention.\u2019 Roger Goss of Patient Concern, said: \u2018These pay packets are simply outrageous. They are indefensible. We need a formal inquiry into this. \u2018It is impossible to justify these ludicrous pay arrangements when patients who are being told they cannot have routine treatments on the NHS and are suffering huge waiting times because of stretched resources. Patients will be horrified.\u2019 Campaigner Julie Bailey, who helped expose the horrific neglect at Stafford Hospital, said: \u2018The public would be shocked with these huge salaries and added perks. \u2018Where else could you fail so badly and yet be rewarded so highly, by yourself?\u2019 Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison union, said: \u2018Staff working in hospitals and health centres up and down the country are right to feel outraged that their pay has been reined in year after year, while their bosses see such huge increases.\u2019 And Richard Murphy, director of Tax Research UK, and an adviser to the TUC, added: \u2018This is the private sector\u2019s influence on the NHS gone mad.\u2019 Sue James retired for a day to claim a \u00a3155,000 payout. TRICK ONE: Retiring for a day. One of the most lucrative loopholes NHS bosses exploit is the health service\u2019s \u201824-hour-retirement\u2019 rule. In the past, the NHS banned employees from retiring to claim benefits and then returning to the same job. From 2008, however, an exception was written in allowing staff to \u2018retire\u2019 for 24 hours to claim retirement benefits before carrying on working. Pension experts said this was aimed to make life easier for highly experienced nurses and other low paid front-line staff and to encourage them not to leave. NHS board members are now exploiting this, allowing them to claim hundreds of thousands of pounds in lump sums from their huge pension pots when they turn 60. This cash can be taken tax-free. But because they only really \u2018retire\u2019 for 24 hours, they can carry on drawing their huge NHS salary afterwards. Peter Herring, chief executive at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, claimed a \u00a3252,000 tax-free lump sum by \u2018retiring\u2019 for 24 hours, before returning to the same position. Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust chief executive Sue James did the same to claim a \u00a3155,000 payout. Despite their public positions, they did not announce their brief retirements and their trusts did not disclose the highly sought-after posts were vacant before re-employing them. Instead, the details were hidden in the small print of their annual reports the following year. Under pension rules, most NHS workers can claim the retirement benefits only if they work for 16 hours or less per week for a month after \u2018retiring\u2019 for 24 hours. But none of the executives approached by the Mail team had announced they were working part time for a month \u2013 or taken a salary cut accordingly. TRICK TWO: Compensation bonuses. Hospital chiefs were awarded extraordinary compensation payments after quitting their pension schemes for apparent tax reasons. Under national rules, there are tax benefits applied to pension pots up to a limit, which was \u00a31.5million until last year and has since been reduced to \u00a31.25million. As a result, many choose to stop contributing to their pots when approaching the limit. When hospital bosses found themselves in this position, however, some received top-ups to their already huge salaries as compensation. South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trust chief executive Lorraine Lambert withdrew from the NHS pension scheme in 2012\/13 as she approached the tax-free pension pot limit. She was awarded \u00a320,000 the following year on top of her \u00a3165,000 salary. A footnote in her trust\u2019s annual report stated: \u2018During 2012\/13 the chief executive withdrew from the NHS Pension Scheme and received additional remuneration to compensate for the loss of the employer\u2019s contribution to that scheme.\u2019 TRICK THREE: Flexible new job. Many bosses retire to claim their huge lump sums \u2013 before being re-employed on \u2018flexible\u2019 contracts. North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust boss Mike Walker earned more than \u00a31million in 2012\/13, including \u00a3855,000 in pension-related benefits. He is also entitled to a \u00a3220,000 tax-free pension lump sum after turning 60 last October. At the end of 2013, Mr Walker \u2013 who has a \u00a31.6million pension pot \u2013 was allowed to \u2018flexibly retire\u2019. The former medical director is now working on the development of a new hospital and a patient feedback system. Because he is no longer on the board, his new pay is not disclosed. TRICK FOUR: Leaving after pension boost. The generous NHS pension scheme is said massively to favour high earners. The scheme \u2013 until this year a final salary system \u2013 still uses a calculation method that gives a huge pension boost as salaries increase. If an employee\u2019s salary suddenly goes up, their pension pot will receive a huge boost \u2013 sometimes worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. As a result, staff promoted to hospital boards see their pension-related benefits for the year rise dramatically. Many bosses appear to stay in jobs until they get a promotion and a pay rise which boosts their pension, before quitting the year after they have banked the pay out.\n","right_summary":"A Daily Mail investigation revealed NHS bosses raked in \u00a335m last year.

{"document":"This is the dramatic moment a homeowner was gunned down and handcuffed by police after she blasted her estranged husband who allegedly broke into her house and tried to kill her. Lisa Skinner, 52, shot the male home invader, who has now been identified as her estranged husband Bradley Skinner, 59, after he broke into the house she\u00a0shared with her mother around 6 p.m. Police said Mr Skinner was armed with both a pistol and a large knife. According to AL.com,\u00a0his injuries are life threatening but she is expected to survive. Shootings: Paramedics tend to a man, thought to be Bradley Skinner after he was shot by his estranged wife. Meanwhile, a woman, thought to be Mrs Skinner, is handcuffed on the ground. Ambulance: A woman, thought to be Mrs Skinner, is taken away by stretcher to an ambulance after a deadly double shooting at a house in a south Huntsville, Alabama, neighborhood. Response: Paramedics tend to Mr Skinner after he was shot and take him to a waiting ambulance. Police said the incident unfolded when her husband broke the glass out of a back door of the home in South Huntsville, Alabama, to get inside. Mugshot: Mr Skinner, pictured here in a mughsot released by Madison County jail, had been ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation prior to a court hearing next month in the couple's divorce. Officers say Mrs Skinner armed herself with a shotgun then went into the garage, where he followed her and aimed his pistol at her. She then opened fire  with\u00a0a shotgun, hitting him in the chest, causing life-threatening injuries. Her mother ran from the house in the 2500 block of Bonnie Oaks Drive to a\u00a0neighbor's\u00a0house and called\u00a0911. Officers from Huntsville police arrived on scene and heard gunshots ring out and saw Mrs Skinner in the garage holding the shotgun. They demanded that she drop her weapon but when she turned toward them with the gun in her hand, at least one officer fired at her, wounding, but not killing her. Mrs Skinner was struck by the police gunfire and both she and her husband were taken to Huntsville Hospital. Lieutenant\u00a0Darryl Lawson said the shootings took place after the man broke into the rear of the house armed with a gun and a knife. At that time, Mrs Skinner told her mother to run away and call police\u00a0-\u00a0so she ran over to a\u00a0neighbor's\u00a0house. Several neighbors reportedly heard the gunfire on the normally quiet street, according to AL.com. Neighbor\u00a0Angela Humlicek, who lives across the street said she heard a single shot and, when she went to see what the noise was, she helped the woman's mother to safety. A spokesman for the Huntsville Police Department, said that the couple was estranged and the woman had been living at the home with her mother. Mrs Skinner also had a protective order against her estranged husband, according to\u00a0WHNT 19 News. Meanwhile, the officer who shot the woman has been placed on administrative leave. Hospital: Paramedics tend to Mr Skinner and take him to Huntsville Hospital - where he is reported to have life threatening injuries. Restraining orders: Mr Skinner, pictured here, had a history of violent outbursts against his estranged wife. Records show that she had filed for multiple orders of protection against him. Double shooting: Officers put up police tape around the house where the two shootings took place. Shooting: Lieutenant Darryl Lawson, said police officers demanded that Lisa Skinner drop her weapon but when she turned toward them with the gun in her hand, at least one officer fired at her, wounding, but not killing her. According to AL.com\u00a0Mrs Skinner, a science teacher at Arab High School, lived in fear of violence from her estranged husband. Records show that she had filed for multiple orders of protection against him and planned to take time off from her teaching job to protect her students from his violent temper. Mrs Skinner's petitions to the court describe her estranged husband, who she was divorcing after almost 11 years, as a 'clever, gifted manipulator' who was heavily armed. In February, a Madison County judge prohibited Mr Skinner from going within 100 yards of the Bonnie Oaks Drive home where Sunday's shooting occurred. Police said he violated that order when he broke into the home, which belongs to his mother-in-law, armed with a handgun and a large knife. He was arrested on February 21 on charges of harassing communications and domestic violence by harassment. Home invasion: Police said Lisa Skinner shot a male home invader, thought to be her estranged husband, after he broke into the house armed with a gun. Eyewitnesses: Police interview witnesses after neighbors reportedly heard the gunfire on the normally quiet street. Shock: Local residents crowd around after the deadly shootings which left two people injured. Mrs Skinner described him as a 'mercurial' man who abused alcohol and prescription and illegal drugs and said he had begun speaking about his death. She wrote: 'On [February 18] he began talking about dying and had often mentioned that he wanted to 'take out all of his enemies and die by PoPo,' meaning he wished the police would kill him after he had killed his enemies. I am certainly now an enemy.' The following day she  never returned home after he was obsessively texting threats to her daughter and the daughter's friend saying that he didn't have much time left. 'I left in fear of becoming a victim of murder\/suicide,' she wrote. And as recently as Friday, Mr Skinner had been ordered - again - to have no contact with his estranged wife or her family.

{"document":"Baby Malakai has been alive for seven months and he's never left the hospital. The newborn cannot see, cannot hear and struggles to breath. Doctors say he may not ever be able to walk. Having been diagnosed with a rare medical condition known as\u00a0Pallister Killian Syndrome (PKS), his mother had to give up her job in Perth in order to provide full-time care for her son. Without an income, Stacy Maitai has been forced to survive on welfare funding of $90 a week to support her baby and her seven-year-old daughter. And the 28-year-old is not eligible for further financial assistance from Centrelink as she is not an Australian citizen. Scroll down for video. Baby Malakai (pictured) has been alive for seven months and he's never left the walls of the hospital. Mother Stacy Maitai\u00a0had to give up her job in Perth in order to care for her son full-time. The newborn cannot see, cannot hear and struggles to breath. Doctors say he may not be able to walk. About\u00a015 to 20 cases of PKS are known to be in Australia,\u00a0according to the Pallister Killian Syndrome Foundation of Australia. PKS is a rare chromosomal disorder which affects about 200 people worldwide and 15 those cases are known to be in Australia, according to the Pallister Killian Syndrome\u00a0Foundation of Australia. It is commonly undiagnosed during pregnancy and is discovered at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complications such as\u00a0developmental delays, seizures and congenital heart defects. Ms Maitai has told of the heartbreaking moment she learnt about her son's condition. 'I wanted to commit suicide because I thought it was all my fault,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'But then I found myself having to choose whether to escape all this and give up my son or be strong for my children by moving forward and staying with them every step of the way. 'It's been a difficult journey so far but also a blessing because I have found hope in Malakai and I know he will make it through.'

'Our power was cut off and I thought we were going to be thrown onto the street,' Ms Maitai said. 'Luckily we've been able to use some of that fundraising money to take it straight to the real estate agent who was understanding enough to let us stay even though we had been behind in rent. 'You know, I came to Australia for a better life and I love it here. It's changed my life. I worked since moving here about four years ago and paid all my taxes.

{"document":"For the first time, the Government's drug regulator - the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) - has approved a remedy containing a traditional Chinese herb. The product, Phynova Joint and Muscle Relief, contains sigesbeckia, a herb traditionally used to treat aches and pains caused by arthritis. 'Until now many GPs have been wary of recommending Chinese herbs, but now there is one product that we know is produced safely and at the optimum dose,' explains Professor George Lewith, a complementary medicine researcher from Southampton University. Sigesbeckia is a herb traditionally used to treat aches and pains caused by arthritis. 'Sigesbeckia gives us another alternative to anti-inflammatory drugs which come with potential side-effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding.' Professor Lewith doesn't use the product himself, but says that before having hip replacements for arthritis he used another herb, Devil's Claw, as a remedy for joint pain. He isn't the only orthodox doctor who recommends complementary therapies to his patients... HERBAL MEDICINE FOR COLDS AND DEPRESSION. Dr Mike Dixon, a GP in Cullompton, Devon, and chairman of the College of Medicine, says he is a 'fan' of herbal medicines because they are 'safe, help to encourage self-care by patients and, in cases such as mint and aloe vera, can be grown by the patients themselves, making them virtually free'. 'My go-to remedy in the cold season is a herb called pelargonium, which I take as soon as I feel a cold coming as it prevents the virus replicating,' he says. 'I also use mint tea for indigestion and make a remedy from the lemon balm that grows in my garden to help me sleep. You just put five leaves in a cup of boiling water and leave it to brew. The remedy I most commonly suggest to patients, though, is St John's wort. There is strong evidence that it helps in tackling mild to moderate depression. It is also a potential treatment for long-term tiredness. 'It can interfere with the contraceptive Pill and some other medications - but it's definitely something that I suggest patients should consider.' Before taking St John's wort, check with your pharmacist or GP. Dr Mike Dixon says he is a 'fan' of herbal medicines because they are 'safe' (posed by model) HYPNOTHERAPY FOR BOWEL TROUBLE. Professor Peter Whorwell, a gastroenterologist at the Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester, specialises in helping people with severe Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). 'By the time they come to me most other treatments have failed, and I recommend hypnotherapy to probably 70 to 80 per cent of them as part of a treatment package including medication, diet and lifestyle changes. 'It works on about 80 per cent of those who try it. IBS involves abnormal muscle spasms of the gut and hypersensitivity of the gut to pain, and is aggravated by stress. Hypnotherapy tackles all three of these causes. 'I have been taught self-hypnosis to help me sleep when my mind is whirring. I think it's a skill every doctor should learn.' TURMERIC FOR ACHES AND PAINS. Dr Uzma Ali, an NHS GP who also works at the Integrated Medical Centre in London, explains that as a child she was always given a glass of warm milk with half a teaspoon of the spice turmeric if she fell over. Dr Uzma Ali was always given a glass of warm milk with half a teaspoon of the spice turmeric if she fell over. 'Only now do I know why that was - turmeric contains an ingredient called curcumin which has been found to have a powerful anti-inflammatory action. 'Now, if I see patients with problems like sports injuries, back pain, whiplash, fibromyalgia or sciatica, I suggest that they add a supplement of curcumin to their treatment - or, if they can't take painkillers, that they use it as their primary remedy. 'My favourite remedy is called Dehlvi's Haldi capsules, which contain turmeric, but you can buy turmeric\/curcumin capsules in health stores - or just add more to your cooking.' ACUPUNCTURE FOR MIGRAINES. Dr Tanvir Jamil, a GP at Burnham Health Centre, near Slough in Berkshire, has been treating his patients with acupuncture for years. 'I mostly offer this to patients for pain relief - particularly migraine. If medication or lifestyle changes such as reducing stress aren't working, acupuncture will often help. I normally give patients one session a week for four weeks. The number\u00a0of GPs in Britain\u00a0who practise homeopathy. 'I combine Chinese acupuncture - which works along energy lines called meridians in the body, that Chinese practitioners believe become imbalanced during illness - and Western acupuncture, which concentrates the needles where it specifically hurts. 'So for migraine, I'd use the needles around the face, either side of the eyebrow, the cheek and just under the ear - along with points in the hands. 'I decided to learn acupuncture when I was a junior doctor over 20 years ago. The evidence is good enough that the government health watchdog, NICE, recommends acupuncture on the NHS for migraines. 'I have had acupuncture myself for neck pain in the past. Exactly how it works isn't known but my personal theory is that it somehow stops the nerves being as sensitive to pain signals. 'It's a once-a-week treatment and there are no side-effects - it could save the NHS a fortune if it was used more widely.' YOGA FOR SKIN COMPLAINTS. Every morning Dr Stefanie Williams, a dermatologist and medical director of European Dermatology London, does ten to 15 minutes of yoga and 20 minutes' meditation at lunchtime. 'Both help my stress levels and also benefit my skin,' she says. 'The stress hormone cortisol raises levels of inflammation in the skin - and this not only triggers faster ageing but aggravates conditions such as acne, eczema and rosacea. The stress hormone cortisol raises levels of inflammation in the skin - yoga can alleviate this. 'For this reason I also advise my patients, whether they are coming to me for skin problems or merely for cosmetic procedures, to try yoga or meditation as part of their treatment plan. 'They are often surprised by the idea, but many have experienced their skin flaring up when they are stressed, so once I explain the science behind why that happens they are very keen to include it.' HOMEOPATHY FOR INDIGESTION. Most conventional doctors are highly sceptical of homeopathy, questioning the idea that minute amounts of a substance that triggers symptoms can also be used to treat those symptoms. Not so Dr Tim Robinson, a GP in Beaminster, Dorset, who has been a GP for 25 years and a homeopath for 20.

{"document":"Graham Leonard, pictured leaving court after admitting endangering an aircraft. A passenger who hijacked a plane's tannoy system while drunk to sing karaoke and then caused an airport to be evacuated could be handed a jail term. Graham Leonard, who was returning to Scotland after attending a Manchester United football match, grabbed the PA microphone on the private charter flight and burst into song for his fellow football fans after drinking beer and gin on match day. And after frustrating the cabin crew with his antics during the flight - including throwing a hot towel at one - he then caused part of an airport to be evacuated after deliberately setting off the fire alarm on arrival in Aberdeen. Sheriff Edward Savage said he was keeping 'all options open' and Mr Kelly to find out what impact a jail sentence would have on his client. 'I'm not entirely satisfied given the very serious nature of these matters that a financial penalty will reflect how serious these matters are,' said Mr Savage. 'I want to make it absolutely clear that I'm keeping all options open.' Leonard, 46, appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court yesterday where he admitted endangering the aircraft and its passengers as well as setting off the airport alarm knowing there was no blaze. The court heard that Leonard, from Newmacher, in Aberdeenshire, had been part of a group of Scots fans that had chartered an Eastern Airways flight to jet down to watch United's 3-0 league win over Tottenham on March 15 this year. They had been drinking beer and gin and tonics before leaving Aberdeen Airport, then spent the day meeting former players at a corporate event in a hotel in Manchester. Fiscal depute Karen Dow said that Leonard was one of three passengers that missed their ride back to the airport after the drunken day out. When he did eventually board the 9:17pm private flight from Manchester he started causing trouble for the cabin crew. Leonard was flying on a priavet charter Eastern Airways flight into Aberdeen Airport (file photo) Ms Dow said: 'During the journey the accused approached the complainer to ask if he could sing a song on the public address system. 'She said no and that was not permitted. The accused went to the PA mic and started singing. 'The complainer approached him and told him to stop and asked him to return to his seat. 'His behaviour persisted. This was frustrating for the complainer as it was part of the communication system used by the captain.' The court heard that the businessman, who owns a painting and decorating firm in Aberdeen, also repeatedly refused to sit down before throwing a hot hand towel at one of the stewardesses. Graham Leonard was returning to Scotland after watching Manchester United at Old Trafford, pictured. On arrival at Aberdeen International Airport he was seen 'talking' into the airport's PA system then activating a fire alarm. Around 40 people had to be evacuated from the area and two units from Scottish Fire and Rescue Service were called out to the false alarm. Defence agent Gregor Kelly said his client was 'mortified' about his conduct but asked the sheriff to consider a financial penalty. He said: 'In the sober light of day he is extremely apologetic. The full extent of what he had done did not become clear until the next day when he spoke to others. After landing at Aberdeen Airport, Leonard set the fire alarm off causing an evacuation. 'He is ordinarily a responsible business man. 'He is a regular on this charter plane which goes down to follow the fortunes of Manchester United. 'They had drank a mixture of beer and gin and tonic before embarking on the flight down. There was a special corporate event at hotel in Manchester with ex-players. 'He got carried away. There is no excuse for his behaviour.' Sentence was deferred for reports. Leonard was ordained to appear next month. Speaking after the case called, he said: 'I'm deeply sorry about what happened. 'It was just a drunken day out that went wrong. I'm sorry for any trouble I've caused. I'm deeply embarrassed about it.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n","right_summary":"Graham Leonard, 44, was flying back to Scotland from Manchester.

{"document":"An elderly couple died in a freak accident after the woman fell down the stairs in a desperate attempt to save her partner who had also tripped. Mary Murphy, 66, is thought to have tried to grab hold of John Wood, 67, when he stumbled at the top of the stairs, but slipped herself and the pair fell to their deaths. Their bodies were found by paramedics on Wednesday in the hallway of their terraced home, after concerns were raised about their welfare. Mary Murphy, 66, and her partner John Wood, 67, died after falling down the stairs at their home in Failsworth, Greater Manchester. Police initially thought the deaths may be suspicious, but after investigating they believe it was a \u2018bizarre and tragic\u2019 accident. It is understood that Miss Murphy, a retired office clerk, had lived at the property in Failsworth, near Oldham, all of her life, having looked after her elderly parents. In recent years she struck up a close friendship with Mr Wood. The retired couple were devoted to each other and attended a prayer group, though it is not known whether either pensioner had any children or close relatives. Miss Murphy had been a regular worshipper at nearby St Mary\u2019s RC Church, where priest Father John McKeown described her as \u2018very kind and well-liked\u2019. He believes the accident occurred because the stairs at her home are very steep and she used a walking stick to get around. Both Miss Murphy and Mr Wood were also overweight and suffered from severe mobility problems. He said: \u2018Mary was not very good on her feet. If one of them tripped while they were trying to get down then this could have brought the pair of them tumbling down. It\u2019s absolutely tragic.\u2019 The couple's home was cordoned off as police forensic investigators were seen going into the property. Residents spoke of their sadness at the couple\u2019s deaths, with one saying: \u2018It is the most shocking thing to happen \u2013 that a simple slip could cost them both their lives. They were devoted to each other. They will be really badly missed in the community because they were such a force for good.\u2019 Another said: \u2018It is very upsetting and we are in mourning. I would see them at mass on Sunday, they were always smiling and you could tell they loved each other.\u2019 Detective Inspector Lewis Hughes from Greater Manchester Police said: \u2018This is an extremely bizarre, albeit tragic incident and our thoughts are with the couple\u2019s family and friends.\u2019 Emergency crews were first called to the terraced house 10.50am on Wednesday and discovered two bodies at the bottom of the stairs.\n","right_summary":"Mary Murphy, 66, and John Wood,67, died falling down stairs at her home.

{"document":"'Nurse death': Vera Maresova, 50, has confessed to killing five women and one man at the hospital. A former nurse in the Czech Republic has admitted murdering six of her elderly patients with massive doses of potassium in order to ease her workload. Vera Maresova, 50, confessed to killing five women and one man over a four-year period at a hospital in  Rumburk - a small town in the north of the country. Dubbed 'Nurse Death' by local media,\u00a0Maresova was initially arrested over the death of a 70-year-old woman last August, but\u00a0has now admitted killing five more people between 2010 and 2014 following a police investigation. According to the prosecution, Maresova injected the potassium straight into the blood stream of her six elderly patients, which caused them to suffer heart failure and eventually death. All of her victims were already in the intensive care unit at the hospital and it is believed Maresova thought their deaths would simply be attributed to natural causes. Initially arrested last August for the death of one patient, a 70-year-old woman who died from potassium poisoning in June, Maresova subsequently admitted killing five others dating back to 2010. In total her victims included five women and one man. 'All of her victims were elderly and needed intensive treatment,' a police spokesperson said. 'The woman who was supposed to care for them but instead killed them because she wanted to make life easier for herself,' he added. 'The terrible number of victims is six. We do not suspect the nurse committed any more murders';, he went on to say.

{"document":"The suicides of five young sailors who served on the same base over two years has unearthed a shocking culture of ice taking, binge drinking, bullying and depression within the Australian Navy. The sailors were stationed or had been stationed at the West Australian port of HMAS Stirling off the coast of Rockingham, south of Perth. Their families did not learn of their previous attempts to take their own lives and their drug use until after their deaths, according to ABC's 7.30\u00a0program. Scroll down for video. Stuart Addison was serving on HMAS Stirling off the coast of Western Australia when he took his own life. Five of the sailors who committed suicide had been serving with the Australian Navy on HMAS Stirling. Stuart Addison hanged himself while he was on-shore leave in 2011 and his father, Mark Addison, was faced with the tough decision to turn off his son's life support after several days in hospital. 'It's a decision that I don't think... any parent should have to make,' Mark told 7.30. Mark was left devastated by his loss and was dealt a further blow when navy records revealed his son had tired to take his own life twice before. Stuart had also been on psychiatric medication, which the family were also unaware about. His father, Mark Addison, was devastated by the blow and had to make the difficult decision to turn his son's life support. Matt Henry, who was friends with Stuart, said there was a drug culture within the Australian Navy. 'They knew and we weren't told about it. We were kept in the dark,' Stuart's sister Jessica Ames said. To make sure this does not happen to other families, Mark has started up a change.org petition\u00a0asking Prime Minister Tony Abbott to allow the families of military personnel access to their files when there was evidence of self-harm. Brett Dwyer, who was best friends with Stuart, took his own life just months later. He wants to make sure the devastating pain he feels never happens to other families. It was also revealed by Stuart's friend and former sailor Matt Henry, who had also attempted to take his own life on several occasions, that ice use and drinking was rife within the ranks of HMAS Sterling. Mr Henry said ice was the 'drug of choice in Western Australia' because it was so readily available through their sailor friends. He said he believed his friends' use of the drug ruined their lives. Another sailor, Brett Dwyer, who served alongside Stuart took his own life just three months after his best friend. Brett's doctors advised the navy he should not have been sent to sea due to chemical burns on his hands. But he was sent to HMAS Stirling where he was bullied by Navy personnel. His RSL counsellor, Brian O'Neill, said one 'disgusting' incident involved Brett being dangled overboard by his legs by shipmates. In late 2011, Brett was discharged after saying he had used drugs, including ice. Mr O'Neill said the young sailor was not taking the illicit substance and just said he did to break free of the navy. 'We woke up in the morning and he was hanging on our balustrade which is in the middle of the house. His mother and I had to cut him down,' Brett's father, Mark Dwyer, told the national broadcaster. Like the Addisons, Brett's family did not find out about his medical history until after his death. Brett was on psychiatric medication to treat his depression. Stuart's family did not know he was on psychiatric medication and sister Jessica Ames said they were kept in the dark by the navy. RSL counsellor Brian O'Neill said Mr Dwyer told the navy he was taking ice to get out of the service. 'I wouldn't wish that on any family. What they did was wrong,' Mark said. 'They think of him as a number. He wasn\u2019t a number, he was our son.' Three more similar cases of men who took their own lives were revealed in the 7.30 report. Their mental health issues and suicide attempts were kept inside the Navy and their families only became aware after their funerals. This included Jake Casey, Ewen McDonald and Stephen Bebbington. Both Jake Casey (left), who was pallbearer for Brett Dwyer, and Stephen Bebbington (right) took their own lives. 'They're trying to sweep this issue under the carpet,' Ewen's sister Kenna Crichton said. He tried to take his own three times before he shot himself in October 2011, following the death of best friend Stephen who committed suicide six months earlier. While Jake Casey, who was pallbearer for Brett Dwyer, developed an ice habit and hanged himself three days before the first anniversary of his friend's death. He had ice in system when he was found. But one navy wife tried to warn the service about the problem when she found out her husband had a drug habit. The wife of Bradley Livingston said he had a drug problem and took ice, which she tried to warn his commanding officer about. Karley Livingston said her claims were ignored and she was treated by the officer as a 'stupid navy wife' Mr Livingston died of a suspected drug overdose, but it is not clear if he wanted to take his own life. Karley Livingston's husband, Bradley Livingston, died of a suspected drug overdose and had tried to prevent this from happening by going to his commanding officer. She was told by the officer to go to the chaplain and was treated like a 'stupid navy wife'. The Navy said it was now investigating Ms Livingston's claim. The service has reviewed its privacy policy about suicide attempts and will not be making changes, 7.30 reported. 'Defence conducted a review of Health Information Practices in late 2013,' the navy said in a statement. 'The review reaffirmed that it is the member who determines who has access to their personal health information and recommended that there be no change to defence policy or practice in third party disclosure.'\n","right_summary":"Five sailors took their own lives while serving on WA's HMAS Stirling.

{"document":"There is an old wives' tale that says the best way to tackle red wine stains on carpets and clothes is to cover them in white wine. And while alcohol is the key to removing a spilled glass, the solution doesn't lie in a glass of Pino Grigio. In a video, a scientist has revealed how gin and vodka dilute red wine stains, why vinegar is so good at removing mineral deposits on glass, and how spit tackles stubborn food stains in your kitchen. Scroll down for video. Red wine is red because of pigments known as anthocyanins, which are alcohol soluble. When higher concentrations of clear alcohol, such as gin, vodka or white rum, are poured onto the stain, the colours dissolve into the liquid rather than drying into the carpet. These can then be soaked up using a paper towel. The video was created by the Washington-based American Chemical Society (ACS) as part of its Reactions series. It covers three household cleaning 'hacks' for windows, carpets and counter tops. The first reveals an alternative to window cleaner is to add two cups of water and a quarter cup of 70 per cent rubbing alcohol to an empty spray bottle. As the video explained:\u00a0'Vinegar is a fantastic cleaner and the secret to its cleaning capacity is acetic acid.' Gin: Pour gin, or another high-proof clear liquor, onto a red wine stain and soak it up with a cloth. Spit:\u00a0Your own spit can be used to lift food stains from counter tops or hard surfaces. Bananas:\u00a0Wipe the inside of the banana skin on the spot of leather that needs to be cleaned. When finished, rub with a damp cloth. Cola: Pour into the toilet bowl and leave to sit for an hour to allow the acid to take effect. Clean the inside of the bowl with a toilet brush and flush away. Vinegar also works. Tomato ketchup: Good for cleaning brass, copper and silver elements. Rub onto the area that needs cleaning, leave to work and wipe with a moist cloth. Mayonnaise: Ideal for removing marks on wood. Use a cloth with a small amount of mayonnaise and wipe the mark that needs to be removed. Leave the oils to work and wipe away any residue with a clean cloth. Brazil nuts: Also effective on wood surfaces. Cut a nut in half and rub vigorously over any scratches. Potatoes: Cut the potato in half and dip the side without peel into baking soda. When covered, firmly rub the potato on rusted areas. Grapefruit: Remove limescale by cutting the grapefruit in half and sprinkling one half with salt. Scrub the area and rinse with water. Coffee: Place dry ground coffee into an old margarine tub with holes in the lid. Place in the fridge and leave to eliminate odour. Acetic acid sits at a 2.4 on the pH scale making it very acidic. Because of this acidity, vinegar \u2018eats away\u2019 at mineral deposits on windows including moisture and dust, while the rubbing alcohol absorbs greasy dirt like fingerprints. Onto red wine stains in fabrics, the video said the key is to 'act fast and grab a bottle of the nearest high proof clear liquor'. This can be vodka, gin or white rum, but the important part is that whichever drink is chosen it must be higher proof than the wine that has been spilled. Keep applying it to the stain while soaking the liquid up with a rag or paper towel until it\u2019s all gone. Red wine is red because of pigments known as anthocyanins, which are alcohol soluble. When higher concentrations of alcohol are poured onto the stain, the colours dissolve into the liquid rather than drying into the carpet. As more alcohol is poured onto to the stain, the red colour dilutes completely and can be soaked up. ACS advise pouring plain water onto the carpet once the alcohol has been soaked up to remove the smell. Elsewhere, if there is a hard food stain on a countertop or hard floor, ACS suggest using spit to remove it. Inside saliva is an enzyme called amylase and it\u2019s used as one of the first steps of digestion. Amylase speeds up the process of breaking down starches, for example. 'You may have noticed when you eat certain starchy foods like potatoes or crackers that they have a slightly sweet taste when you chew them,' said ACS. 'That\u2019s the amylase in action and the same principle can be used to break down food spills.' A cleaning expert from Hassle.com recently revealed the science behind why certain foods are so useful for tackling rust, removing stains and tightening cracks in wood, too. The American Chemical Society (ACS) has produced a video as part of its Reactions series that covers three household cleaning 'hacks'. These include how to get streak-free windows, remove red wine stains from carpets (pictured) and clean stubborn food stains from counter tops and hard surfaces. Alex Depledge, Hassle.com's chief executive told MailOnline that tomato ketchup is good for cleaning brass, copper and silver elements. 'Tarnishing mainly occurs due to sulphur compounds in the air,' she said. 'When the ketchup is applied to the metal, the natural acid in the tomatoes reacts with the oxidising of the tarnished silver, brass or copper.' 'Potatoes and baking soda are effective at tackling rust because the oxalic acid in the potato mixes with the baking soda to help to dissolve the rust.' An alternative to window cleaner is to take an empty bottle and add two cups of water and a quarter cup of 70% rubbing alcohol. As the video explained: 'Vinegar is a fantastic cleaner and the secret to its cleaning capacity is acetic acid.' Acetic acid sits at a 2.4 on the pH scale making it very acidic' (pictured) Because of this acidity, vinegar \u2018eats away\u2019 at mineral deposits on windows including moisture and dust, while rubbing alcohol (pictured) absorbs greasy dirt like fingerprints, said the chemist. Even the weakest levels of acid can dissolve and loosen the hydrated iron oxides found in rust. This also means vinegar is a good rust remover. These foods can also replace the rust with a thin film of smooth hard oxide on the surface of the iron, to help it resist further hydrated oxidation. Phosphoric acid in cola drinks, and citric acid in lemon juice also work. 'Banana skins are often used to buff leather, followed by a damp cloth, and this is effective because the potassium in bananas is absorbed and slowly works to plump up the scratches,' Mrs Depledge said. To remove hard food stains on a countertop or hard floor, ACS suggests using spit to remove it.

'You may have noticed when you eat certain starchy foods like potatoes that they have a slightly sweet taste when you chew them,' said ACS. 'That\u2019s the amylase in action and the same principle can be used to break down food spills' Potassium is often found in shoe polishes too, for the same reason. 'Ideal for removing marks on wood, mayonnaise contains oils and proteins that gently diminish scratches and marks on wood. 'They also react and cause the wood to swell, which tightens cracks in surface. 'The oils in Brazil nuts are also effective and act like a natural die to darken and hide scratches.' Elsewhere, Mrs Depledge added: 'To keep a fridge smelling fresh, experts claim putting dry ground coffee into an old margarine tub with holes in the lid will eliminate odours. A cleaning experts has also revealed which food items can be used to clean a home. For example, potatoes remove rust because the oxalic acid reacts with baking soda to dissolve the hydrated iron oxides. Banana skins (stock image pictured) are often used to buff leather, followed by a damp cloth, and this is effective because the potassium in bananas is absorbed and slowly works to plump up the scratches. Potassium is often found in shoe polishes too, for the same reason. 'Smelly substances floating around in the air attach themselves to the surface of coffee beans via a process known as \u2018adsorption'. 'Invisible to the naked eye the many tiny pores in a coffee bean create a large surface area, per unit mass. 'This gives, in chemical terms, plenty of area for the smell to adhere itself to and causes it to be cancelled out.' As a subsititute to limescale remover, Mrs Depledge recommends cutting a grapefruit in half and sprinkling one half with salt. The salt acts like an exfoliator to remove the surface limescale, while the citric acid in grapefruit acts as the cleaning agent and breaks down the scale at a more molecular level. And cola drinks are an effective toilet cleaner because they contains carbonic, citric, and phosphoric acids. Many of these acids are found in household cleaning products already, and when mixed together, the reaction causes the stains to be lifted and removed.

{"document":"Arrest: Rachel Lehnardt, 35, allegedly threw a drunken party for her 16-year-old daughter. A mother-of-five threw her teenage daughter a party, played naked Twister with her friends and then had sex with an 18-year-old in the bathroom, authorities have said. Rachel Lynn Lehnardt, 35, from Evans, Georgia, was arrested on Saturday night and has been charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The details of the drunken party emerged when Lehnardt met with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor last Friday and told her about the wild party. The sponsor then contacted authorities. She told the woman that her children, who are aged between four and 16, were with their father when her oldest daughter texted her to ask if she could bring over some friends. Lehnardt allegedly responded: 'Come on, let's party', WJBF reported. When the teenagers arrived, she allegedly allowed them to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in her home, before she played naked Twister with them in the living room. While the youngsters continued playing, she allegedly went into a bathroom and had sex with an 18-year-old man, the sponsor told authorities. When she returned, she brought out sex toys and started to use them on herself in front of the teenagers, she told her sponsor,\u00a0Augusta Crime reported. Party: The mother-of-five allegedly played naked Twister with her daughter and her friends before having sex with an 18-year-old male in the bathroom. She later had sex with her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend. She later went to bed alone and around 3.30am, she awoke to find someone having sex with her, she told her sponsor. 'She stated at first she thought it was the 18-year-old from earlier, but then realized it was the 16-year-old who was in fact her daughter's boyfriend,' Lehnardt's sponsor told deputies. The daughter told her mother she felt guilty because the boyfriend's 10-inch penis was so large she could not have sex with him, and he needed to have sex with her mother instead. While the incident sounds as if the 16-year-old raped the mother, Sheriff's spokesman Captain Steve Morris said there was no evidence of a crime and no charges are pending against the boy. No sexual crime charges have been filed against Lehnardt because 16 is the legal age of consent. Lehnardt also allegedly told the sponsor that she had shown her daughter explicit photos, including of Lehnardt having sex with her boyfriend. The sponsor said that the mother has also previously spoken about being a porn addict. Scene: She allegedly threw the party at her home in Evans, Georgia, pictured, and lost custody of her children after the incident. She has been charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Following the incident, an emergency custody hearing was held and she lost custody of her five children, who are aged four, six, eight, 10 and 16, WJBF reported. At their meeting last week, the sponsor asked Lehnardt how long she had been sober and her future plans for sobriety, and the mother told her about losing custody of the children days before. After their meeting, the woman, who was only recently assigned to sponsor Lehnardt, contacted the Columbia County Sheriff's Office and the mother was arrested on Saturday. She has been released from the Columbia County Detention Center after posting a $3,200 bond, according to the Columbia County News-Times. According to online profiles, Lehnardt crafts and paints dolls. The children's father is in the military. Lehnardt was arrested after sharing details of the incident with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, who then went to authorities. As part of the AA's 12 Step program, members write a list of incidents they feel guilty about and confide in their sponsor about the acts (known as the Fifth Step). The person is then required to make amends for past wrongdoings, as long as doing so does not cause harm to others. While there is an expectation of anonymity at meetings, there is no guarantee, and experts recommend exercising caution when detailing crimes, according to\u00a0The Fix. AA literature simply states that 'anonymity provides protection for all members from identification as alcoholics'. The main 'Understanding Anonymity' booklet does not mention safety from disclosure of a crime and there have been multiple cases of AA members being convicted of crimes, including, murder after confessing to their sponsors.

{"document":"A former Fortune 500 executive from New Hampshire who caused a highway crash that killed a Vermont couple and their unborn baby was accused of being 'heartless' in court on Wednesday by angry family members. Prosecutors have said Robert Dellinger told investigators he was trying to kill himself in December 2013 when he drove his pickup truck across an Interstate 89 median and smashed into an SUV carrying 24-year-old Amanda Murphy, who was 8 months pregnant, and her fiance, 29-year-old Jason Timmons. Relatives of Murphy and Timmons tore into Dellinger during the first of the two-day sentencing hearing. Amanda Murphy's mother, Tammy Langlois, and Murphy's sister, Ashley Murphy, cry after speaking about the moment they learned of the accident that killed Murphy, her unborn child, and her fiancee, Jason Timmons, during Robert Dellinger's sentencing  on Wednesday. Defense attorney Lucy Karl comforts Robert Dellinger after testimony by the families of Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons. The former Fortune 500 executive has admitted causing a highway crash that killed them and their unborn fetus. 'I have been robbed and violated. I will never see or touch my child ever again,' Timmons' mother, Debbie Blanchard, said as she fought back tears. 'How could you be so heartless? You still have a family; you have taken mine from me', reports the Valley News of West Lebanon. Dellinger appeared to be deeply remorseful during the hearing, the newspaper reported. 'You have my deepest, most heartfelt apology, condolences and remorse for your loss. I am so sorry,' the 54-year-old Dellinger said through sobs. 'My guilt and remorse will be with me forever. I ask for your forgiveness, and I pray for your healing.' Dellinger, of Sunapee, New Hampshire, was a senior vice president and chief financial officer at PPG Industries Inc. when he left in 2011 because of health problems. He also held high-level posts at Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co. Earlier he had  told the court he has 'never been suicidal.' Tragic: John Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, were killed instantly in the crash on December 7, 2013. Pregnant: This is an ultrasound of the couple's unborn baby who they were going to call Reagan Elizabeth. He pleaded guilty in February to negligent homicide for the deaths of the couple, who were from Wilder, Vermont, and to assault for the death of the fetus. He faces 12 to 24 years in prison when sentencing resumes on Thursday. During Wednesday's hearing, Dellinger's wife, Deborah, called him a man of 'ethics, integrity and friendship,' the Valley News reported. 'We are devastated by the deaths of your loved ones,' she said as her husband broke down at the defense table. 'We have been and continue to pray every day for your collective peace and comfort.' Dellinger reportedly broke down in tears at the defense table as his wife was speaking to the relatives of Murphy and Timmons. Defense lawyers have said Dellinger was suffering from delirium due to a 'toxic regime' of prescription medications for multiple sclerosis and depression. In asking for a shorter sentence, they also contend he was suffering from withdrawal of a sleeping aid. Robert Dellinger thanks his family and friends for their support in court on Wednesday. He told a judge that he wasn't suicidal at the time of the crash. Attorney Steven Gordon wrote in a sentencing brief they now know 'a medical event' was the main cause 'of this accident.' Dellinger has been jailed since his arrest in December. His lawyers want a sentence that would see him serve only about eight months in prison after being given credit for time already served. Investigators say Dellinger told them that on the day of the accident he 'had a disagreement with his wife and went to Vermont to drive around. He said he was very depressed and gloomy and wanted to have a car wreck and kill himself.' On Wednesday, Dellinger told the court: 'I have never been suicidal.' Assistant Attorney General Geoffrey Ward said in court that Dellinger's truck reached 101 mph in the seconds before the crash and was going 87 mph one second before he hit the SUV. His truck sheared off the top of the SUV. The medical examiner's report compared the injuries suffered by Murphy and Timmons to those of plane crash victims. Dellinger suffered cuts and bruises. Crushed: This is a picture of the scene of the crash after Dellinger careered over the central median in December 2013. According to the prosecution, the former executive had argued with his wife over his. medications on the morning of the crash,\u00a0WMUR reported. 'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire Susan Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.' Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato,. however called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a. 'productive and exemplary life.' He. took a severance package worth more than $1million in cash plus stocks. when he left in 2011 because of health reasons, according to documents. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

{"document":"Eden Hazard believes Chelsea have the Premier League title in their grasp. Hazard scored a penalty and set up Loic Remy's winner - either side of Charlie Adam's 65-yard strike - in Saturday's 2-1 win over Stoke which saw the Blues take a seven-point lead at the top of the standings. Jose Mourinho has targeted five wins and one draw in the remaining eight games and Hazard is optimistic Chelsea will win a first Premier League title in five years. Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard insists his side are close to getting their hands on the Premier League title. Hazard jumps in the air to celebrate his goal during the hard-fought win over Stoke City in west London. Hazard told Chelsea TV: 'We are confident. We are first in the league and we take game after game. We have the title in our hands. We want to bring the trophy to Stamford Bridge.' Hazard felt Chelsea's win could have been more convincing. 'In the first half we created a lot of chances,' he added. 'We played beautiful football and OK, we scored just one goal, but we deserved to score three or four. The Belgian international gave Chelsea the lead from the spot and made no mistake against Asmir Begovic. 'The most important thing was the victory and we did very well till the end.' Remy's strike came after Diego Costa had come on as a half-time substitute before going off with a recurrence of his hamstring problem 11 minutes later. Hazard has backed Remy, who could be given an extended run in Costa's anticipated absence, to keep on scoring after the France striker's second winner in successive games. 'He can score every time when he's on the pitch. This guy deserves to score a lot of goals,' Hazard said. Loic Remy finishes to put Chelsea back in front after a mistake by Stoke City keeper Begovic. The Belgium playmaker dazzled at times against Stoke, but the game's highlight was Adam's audacious lob of Thibaut Courtois from well inside his own half. Chelsea felt aggrieved Hazard had not been awarded a foul before Adam drilled the ball into the home net. In hindsight, and with victory secured, Hazard joked he was happy referee Jonathan Moss had not blown his whistle as, had a foul been given, Adam's goal would never have happened. 'I was on the floor. I didn't see the goal,' Hazard said. 'I'm happy the referee didn't whistle because the goal was fantastic.'\n","right_summary":"Eden Hazard scored in Chelsea's 2-1 home win against Stoke City.

{"document":"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)On March 20, 2013, a cyberattack brought chaos to several banks and media outlets in South Korea. Then more ominously on December 23 last year, computers at the country's nuclear operator were breached.  Again cybercrime was suspected. The source of these attacks? North Korea. And South Korean investigators say they have proof -- the actual malicious codes used in the attacks. They shared this data with CNN. The 2013 attack, known as \"Dark Seoul,\" paralyzed an estimated 48,000 computers at a number of major banks and broadcasters, disrupting network systems and wiping their hard disks clean. \"It would try to delete essentially all your files... then restart the system. You would come back up and nothing would be there,\" Joshua James, a digital forensic expert, told CNN. \"If it infected more financial systems, it could have deleted all financial data in Korea. I mean, it is dangerous,\" the visiting professor at Chuncheon's Hallym University added. Live footage of the breaches showed computer screens at the media companies completely down, while bank customers were unable to make withdrawals, or transfer money online. \"Dark Seoul\" happened shortly after the North Korean government announced it would end the armistice agreement that brought the three-year Korean War to an end in July 1953 amid growing tensions with its neighbor. The latest high-profile digital incursion, in December, attempted to steal data from South Korea's nuclear operator, including plant blueprints and personnel information. Though investigators said no critical data was stolen, the attack raised serious concerns about the safety and security of the 23 nuclear power plants it runs. The attack itself was described by James as a \"spear-fishing\" exercise where unsuspecting victims -- retired and current employees of the nuclear operator -- were prompted to open up a disguised document in their email. \"As soon as you double click on it, it starts running in the background of your computer where you can't see ... it's also trying to open up your computer -- what we call a back door -- to give access to the infected system by the attacker,\" he told CNN. The attack, which James said was simpler than \"Dark Seoul,\" came just a few days after Sony Pictures said their systems has been \"hacked,\" another attack the South Korean authorities blamed on North Korea. \"From a law enforcement or investigation side, we're trying to actually trace back to who did it,\" said James. Seoul announced in mid-March that some of the IP addresses used in December incursion could be traced back to Shenyang, China, which can be easily accessed from the North Korean border. Codes used in the attack were said to be similar in pattern to those used by the North Koreans, South Korean authorities said. \"The malicious codes used in the attack were same in composition and working methods as \"Kimsuky\" codes known to be used by North Korea,\" the prosecutor's office that leads 17 other government agencies and Internet companies in the investigation said in the statement in March. Pyongyang has dismissed the claims it launched these attacks, calling them a \"plot and fabrication that can never win over the truth.\" But many experts say North Korea appears to be investing more in cyberwarfare because it is cheaper than spending on conventional weapons and can cause significant economic damage to its southern rival. Indeed South Korea's Defense Ministry estimates that North Korea is operating a \"cyberarmy\" of 6,000 workers as it focuses on strengthening its asymmetrical warfare capability. \"Hacks are going on all the time, constantly -- though how many actually make the news is a very small amount,\" said James. \"How many are detected in general? I think the average person would have no clue they've been hacked. \"Organizations need to invest the same amount that hackers are investing to protect themselves and right now they're not,\" he added. Many in South Korea believe not enough effort is being put into defending against cyberattacks. A report by the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade, a government-funded think tank, estimates that \"Dark Seoul\" caused about $820 million worth of damage. Its report, published in 2014, predicted that by 2020, South Korea could be exposed to hacking attacks causing up to $25 billion in economic damage.\n","right_summary":"South Korean investigators say they have proof that North Korea is launching cyberattacks.

{"document":"As if it wasn't bad enough having a job that involves routinely entering strangers' homes, these estate agents may have just been put off for life. As a part of Sky Living's promotion for its upcoming three-part drama, The Enfield Haunting, real London estate agents were invited to value a house in a viral video. What they didn't know, is that the house had been rigged with special effects to give the appearance of being possessed by a ghost. London estate agents were invited to a fake haunted house, where they were subject to terrifying pranks. Installed with secret cameras, microphones and booby traps, the unsuspecting estate agents are subject to cruel, but hilarious, pranks - which prompt hysterical reactions. An ordinary house in Enfield is chosen as the location, and to draw the estate agents in, is a pretend homeowner, Rosie, who wants her house valued. Upon entering the house, Rosie solemnly explains to the estate agents that the house was owned by her brother, who just so happened to also pass away in it. An ordinary house is chosen in Enfield for unsuspecting London estate agents to value. Cameras are installed the walls and members of the team monitor the hilarious reactions. An estate agent is invited into the house and greeted by the fake homeowner, Rosie. This already to serves to unsettle one estate agent, as his eyes widen in surprise. Once the scene is set, the funny pranks begin, and a shelf collapses randomly behind the estate agents. One reacts by literally leaping into the air and retracting his arms to his chest in a protective stance. Another startled estate agent lifts his hands up into the air in an automatic surrender position. Another gasps and raises her hand to her mouth, her shoulders jolting. Rosie (pictured right) explains to the estate agent (pictured left) that her brother recently died in the house. The estate agent looks nervous and unsettled. A shelf behind the estate agent collapses and he reacts with leaping into the air in shock. When the shelf collapses, another estate agent gasps, her shoulder jolting in shock. Already unsettled by the shelf, Rosie proceeds to lead them up the stairs, and gestures for them to look at the bathroom, while she attends to her phone ringing in another room. One of the estate agents is looking around, as the tap switches on by itself. As he goes to turn off the tap, it switches off by itself. Confused, he turns to leave the room, at which point the tap begins creepily running again, and again, turns off when he reaches towards it. In one room, marbles begin violently spilling out of one of the cabinets randomly. A combination of the noise and surprise causes one estate agent to shriek. As the marbles spill out of the cabinets, another estate agent throws his hands up in the air in surprise. He exits the room appearing puzzled and disconcerted. In the next shot, the estate agents are seen entering another bedroom, at which point marbles begin spilling violently out of one of the top cabinets, which is again met with hilarious reactions. As well as horrified screams and petrified stares from the estate agents, one of them throws his hands up in a surrender position, insisting: 'I didn't touch anything!' A cabinet randomly and violently topples over prompting a gasp from the estate agent. A woman is shocked as the cupboard doors begin rattling and things begin spilling out loudly. Frightened, another man turns around as the door slams violently behind him. Many of the estate agents are truly alarmed at this point and go in search of Rosie, the fake homeowner. Upon entering another bedroom, the team really begin to up the ante with the special effects. First a stocky wardrobe unit loudly topples over onto the floor, and the door creakily swings shut by itself. One woman presses her hand to her chest, truly gobsmacked and exclaims: 'Woah! ' Another man screams frantically for the owner of the house. A woman stares at the wardrobe doors in horror as they begin to open and close and things begin to tumble out. She appears horrified as the door slams by itself behind her, her arms crossed in a protective stance. One man decides to intervene in the ghostly occurrence and kicks the spinning chair angri. Several of the wardrobe unit doors begin rattling and opening randomly unassisted, with objects falling out, and a chair begins spinning on its own. One of the estate agents cowers in the corner, shakily running his hands through his hair and appears evidently faint. Another man comically kicks the spinning chair and shrieks: 'Get Out!' At this point, many can't take the strange disturbances any more and run down the stairs, where the team members are revealed and they are let in on the prank. With relieved expressions and nervous laughter, they seem grateful that there is in fact no ghostly presence. The estate agents are let in on the prank as the cameras are revealed. One in particular seems extremely relieved that it is all a joke. 'Genuinely, I thought it was real': One estate agent appears shaken from his fake haunting experience. One said: 'I'm actually speechless, like my heart's actually going.' Another insists: 'Genuinely, I thought it was for real.' The Enfield Drama will be based on bizarre poltergeist-related events that occurred at a council house in 1977. Starring Timothy Spall, the three-part drama, The Enfield Haunting will air on Sky Living on 3 May 2015.\n","right_summary":"London estate agents invited to value a house rigged with special effects.

{"document":"Controversial bookmakers Paddy Power have provoked outrage with a 'joke' about the African-American police beatings. In a tweet published ahead of Liverpool's clash against Newcastle tonight, the bookmakers appeared to make light of the issue in the wake of a succession of stories in the US regarding police shootings on African-Americans. On the Paddy Power Offers page, a tweet was published that read: 'Newcastle have suffered more Kop beatings over the last 20 years than an unarmed African-American male'. It was accompanied by a smirking picture of Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers and has resulted in a furious backlash on social media. Controversy: Paddy Power appeared to make a joke about the recent police shootings on African-Americans. One said: 'This is the most disgusting tweet I've read in probably my entire time on Twitter.' She added: 'How dare you make the execution of Black men in America the butt of your jokes'. Another quipped: 'What's funny? Black people being killed? Explain yourself.' Others lined up to condemn the bookmakers describing the tweet as 'deplorable', 'unbelievable', 'horrible' and 'disgusting'. Last week, white South Carolina police officer Michael Slager was charged with the murder of Walter Scott, a black man, who was filmed running away from the officer. Mourners at Mr Scott's funeral service were told by the pastor that his death was the result of 'overt 'racism'. This is not the first time Paddy Power - who employs Harriet Harman's son, Harry Dromey as its 'Mischief Champion' - has courted controversy. Paddy Power's controversial advert about the outcome of the Oscar Pistorius murder trial was the most complained about advertisement in Britain last year. It offered 'money back if he walks' for punters betting on the outcome of the trial. After receiving 5,525 complaints, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) pulled the advert on the grounds it trivialised 'the issues surrounding a murder trial, the death of a woman and disability.' Pistorius was last year jailed for five years for killing girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, although he could be released this year. Criticism:\u00a0Paddy Power's controversial advert about the outcome of the Oscar Pistorius murder trial was the most complained about advertisement in Britain last year. Earlier this year, the bookmakers attracted criticism for an advertising campaign poking fun at foreign owners of British football clubs by featuring a team of players wearing Middle Eastern robes. In the past, it has been derided for an advert showing a cat being kicked into a tree by a blind footballer. It was the most complained about advert of 2010, but was cleared by the ASA and did not face a ban. Paddy Power also created 2002's most complained-about advert, with a campaign that placed odds on two elderly women making it across the road safely. On that occasion, it was banned by the ASA. Last year, the bookmakers sponsored US basketball star Dennis Rodman to make a controversial trip to North Korea to hand over gifts to Kim Jong-un. This included an Irish Whiskey set - reportedly worth thousands of pounds - which was given as a birthday present for the North Korea dictator,. In response to the latest furore, a spokesman for Paddy Power said: 'It's clearly an acerbic reference to recent police activity in the US. And obviously, no offence was meant.'\n","right_summary":"Paddy Power said on its Twitter page: 'Newcastle have suffered more Kop beatings over the last 20 years than an unarmed African-American male' It has resulted in a furious backlash, with people calling it 'deplorable' Bookmakers have attracted criticism in the past for controversial adverts.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Paddy Power has sparked controversy with a tweet about African-American police beatings, causing outrage on social media.

{"document":"Christian Benteke has revealed a secret. Despite what appeared cast-iron evidence to the contrary, he does not practise free-kicks. He has taken only a handful in his career. Yet with seven minutes to go in a game Aston Villa dared not lose, he stepped forward, pushing aside team-mates, to curl his dead-ball opportunity over the Queens Park Rangers wall and into the net. Precious point rescued. \u2018I surprised myself!\u2019 he says, laughing. \u2018When I saw it, Charles N\u2019Zogbia said, \u201cI want to shoot\u201d. But I said, \u201cI want to take it\u201d. Christian Benteke bends a free-kick over the QPR wall to rescue a point for Aston Villa last week. Benteke jumps for joy after sealing his hat-trick in the relegation battle with QPR at Villa Park. The Belgium striker admitted he even surprised himself by finding the back of the net with the free kick. \u2018It wasn\u2019t about the hat-trick, it was more about if I can take the free-kick or not, if I can hit the target. I have only taken one before for Villa, against Swansea, and I hit the post.\u2019 What happens should a chance come from similar range against Liverpool? \u2018I\u2019ll take it. Sometimes you have to try.\u2019 So speaks a striker of soaring confidence. Eight goals in his last six games, the latest a towering header to take all three points at Tottenham, Benteke is bang in form and relishing the prospect of an FA Cup semi-final. Sitting to discuss the match in a dressing room at Villa\u2019s Bodymoor Heath training complex, he looks as if he would like to be on Wembley\u2019s turf post-haste. He has been rejuvenated under Tim Sherwood, scoring a goal every 87 minutes since the new Villa manager took over. The unnerving thing for Liverpool is that he says he will get better. Benteke rises above Fererico Fazio to head the winning goal for Aston Villa against Tottenham on Saturday. Benteke points to the sky in celebration after scoring his eighth goal in six matches. Benteke is in the kind of form which could see Tim Sherwood's Villa escape from Premier League relegation. \u2018I still think I can do more, in everything,\u2019 he insists. \u2018I can\u2019t say I\u2019m happy to be there now, I want to do more and more.\u2019 That insatiable appetite is understandable after a disheartening year, starved first of football, then chances. It was April 3, 2014, when a loud crack was heard across Bodymoor\u2019s training pitches signalling Benteke\u2019s ruptured achilles. His World Cup dream was over. Parents Jean-Pierre and Marie-Claire cancelled their tickets to Brazil. Six months of rehabilitation followed before Benteke\u2019s return last October. A red card on his third start against Tottenham kept him out for another brief period. There was a splendid goal at Crystal Palace, then another against Manchester United. A third came against Blackpool in the FA Cup third round. Dazzlingly good, but these strikes were isolated. Benteke never appeared his barnstorming self. His movement was limited, his impact negligible. Villa\u2019s safety-first style was a significant factor. Often Benteke looked cut adrift up front. The nadir came when Paul Lambert dropped him to the bench for the visit of Chelsea in February. \u2018It was frustrating because I knew I could do better,\u2019 he says, reflecting on that moment. \u2018Every time after the game I said to myself, \u201cI can do better\u201d. It was frustrating to play a game with no chances. But I am not that guy who is going to complain. I understood the situation.\u2019 Sherwood\u2019s impact has been immediate. Just as he did with Emmanuel Adebayor at Tottenham, he has taken a misfiring striker and recalibrated the shooting. Sherwood\u2019s tactics are tailored to Benteke and his relentless positivity has awoken the inner beast. Benteke was forced to watch Belgium reach the quarter-final of the World Cup after rupturing his achilles. Benteke praised the impact of new manager Sherwood for playing a style that suits the striker's attributes. \u2018He has given me a lot of freedom and he has said to the other lads to play maybe more direct with me,\u2019 explains Benteke. \u2018When a manager says that, you feel more important, more responsible. \u2018The way that we play now is comfortable for me because I\u2019m scoring and also for the team because I help the team.\u2019 He is excited about his partnership with Gabby Agbonlahor. \u2018He helps me destroy the defenders. With two we\u2019re always better than one.\u2019 Benteke is grateful to Lambert for bringing him to Villa from Genk in 2012 but acknowledges it was the correct call to sack the manager. \u2018That\u2019s a tough question,\u2019 he pauses. \u2018I will say yes because the confidence of the team was a little bit low and when the gaffer came he brought the confidence up.\u2019 Benteke believes his fitness after such a long time out was an issue too but now he feels in peak condition. \u2018I play like I used to before. I feel really good.\u2019 Those summer weeks when he could only watch his nation\u2019s World Cup adventure on TV are becoming a distant, if difficult, memory. Benteke is delighted with the partnership he has struck up with fellow striker Gabby Agbonlahor. The striker paid tribute to former manager Paul Lambert for signing him from Genk in 2012. \u2018It was tough,\u2019 he says. \u2018I worked hard for that opportunity. But that\u2019s life. The manager Marc Wilmots said, \u201cIf you want, you can come with the lads.\u201d But I didn\u2019t. I came back to Belgium and my family helped get me through. My mum said, \u201cYou have to be thankful to God, it could have been worse\u201d.\u2019 Becoming a father to baby Jayden last September put things in perspective. \u2018It was good, I forgot about my injury,\u2019 he says, smiling. Doubts about his talent emerged during his troubles but he has faced down critics before. Three years ago Genk dismissed his Premier League credentials. \u2018They said I wasn\u2019t ready because the level between Belgium and England is really high and I should stay one more season. But I said, \u201cNo, I am confident, I want to go\u201d. I don\u2019t really listen to what people say. If I feel it, I just do it. But Benteke concedes that sacking Lambert was the correct decision after the lift Sherwood has given them. Chelsea midfielder and compatriot Eden Hazard tweeted his admiration for Benteke after his Spurs winner. \u2018It was my dream to play in the best league. I was a fan of Arsenal.\u2019 He insists he is not dreaming of scoring at Wembley. \u2018I don\u2019t want a dream, I want to do it.\u2019 He is not that close to compatriot Simon Mignolet but is good friends with Marouane Fellaini and Eden Hazard. \u2018I have known them since I was really young.\u2019 Hazard tweeted his admiration following Benteke\u2019s goal at Spurs. \u2018He is my brother, like you say. For me, he deserves to be the Player of the Year.\u2019 Benteke will consider what he deserves in the summer. Wolfsburg have been keeping tabs on him. \u2018Since I came I have had a lot of pressure here,\u2019 he says. \u2018If I want to one day, after say four or five years, be with the big club, then it is pressure every time also.\u2019 He ultimately wants European football. That will come for Villa by reaching the final, should Arsenal also qualify. \u2018I think this is the beauty of the FA Cup, now everything is possible,\u2019 he says.\n","right_summary":"Aston Villa face Liverpool at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday.

{"document":"By the time he reached 17, there was no room for Geoff Johnson at home. His mother started compulsively hoarding when he was a young boy, refusing to trash anything; unable to fix anything. In his senior year, 1995, it was too much: he moved out. Now, two decades later, he and his younger sister Jennifer McShea have returned to the family home in Omaha, Nebraska \u00a0- and nothing has changed. Geoff, 37, had visited his mother but only stood outside before picking her up to spend time elsewhere. Jennifer, also 37, returned just twice, on the advice of her counselor, to confront the deeply-embedded shame she felt. But when their mother passed away following a 12-year battle with breast cancer in 2013, the house was handed to them. Finally returning to the meticulous havoc, they were inspired to create a moving photo-series with their own children to document the reality of being a hoarder's child. Scroll down for video. Life as a hoarder's child: Geoff Johnson returned to the home of his mother, a compulsive hoarder, 20 years after he left and created a moving series of images about his uneasy upbringing. He did this by superimposing shots of his son onto images of the trash-ridden home in Omaha. 'No place for a child': His younger sister Jennifer, also aged 37, joined him as they confronted their past after their mother died of breast cancer in 2013. Jennifer's four-year-old daughter is superimposed onto a shot of the bathroom which has not been touched since they left in 1993. Geoff, a photographer, wanted to picture his son and Jennifer's daughter going about their daily lives among the trash - as they had done years before. But the crumbling house is so unsafe, and their feelings still so raw, that they opted to use Photoshop and superimpose the children onto the images. Regardless, the highly realistic results strike an uneasy feeling that Geoff says was so difficult to come to terms with. 'It is difficult to describe the feeling of shame, the fear of embarrassment that you have growing up with a hoarder,' Geoff, who is still based nearby in Omaha, tells DailyMail.com. 'People would say \"why didn't you just throw things away?\" It's just not as simple as that. Hoarders have a deep-rooted sense of attachment to things and it seems crazy but they have a sense of order. 'My sister and I would try to throw things away, but if anything even moved our mom would get very upset. 'Going back was an emotional experience. 'When we were kids, I would only ever open the door by a crack when people came by. We never had people over. 'It's a complex issue': Geoff said people have since asked him why they didn't just throw things away. He said the issue was deeper than that and his mother had a deep-rooted attachment to every little piece of the havoc. But as a child it was difficult to understand. 'Sense of perspective': Jennifer said the pictures have helped her to see that the home she felt so uncomfortable in was no place for children. Jennifer's bedroom: Jennifer made clear that she did not want the children to enter the crumbling house, which is  filled with mold, as it is unsafe and also occupies a difficult emotional space for her. She wants her daughter to know that she would never put her in that situation. Breaking point: Geoff moved out when he was 17 in 1995 when a pipe burst during the winter. 'There was no heating and I had to be responsible. It was the hardest thing I had had to do in my life up until that point and I couldn't take it any more,' he said. 'Things would break and never be fixed. We didn't have a working refrigerator - we would leave food on the back porch in the winter, and get a cooler in the summer, but that would break too. 'I had to leave in January of my senior year because the pipes broke. It was so cold, there was no heating, and I was just 17. It was the hardest thing I'd had to do in my life up until that point; to be the adult, be responsible. It was too much for me, so I left.' Jennifer was already long-gone by that point. Just 19 months younger than Geoff, she left when she was 15 in 1993, to live with their father in the same village. She didn't return until she finished college in 2001. 'I was going through counseling, and discovered that the house was a big part of the issues I was dealing with,' Jennifer, based in Florida, told DailyMail.com. 'My counselor said I should go back, and take friends to confront the feeling of embarrassment. It was that feeling that people didn't know about that side of our lives. We never let anyone in, and then we left it behind. Feeling of shame: In this image (left) Geoff is recreating the way he would hide behind the door when people came to visit, and never let people come to visit. Jennifer returned to the house when she finished college on the advice of her counselor to confront the feeling of shame. Unmoved: They photographed the scene completely untouched when they returned to clean it up after their mother passed away. The moment they returned together was important for them, they said. They both knew what each other had gone through as kids. 'The first time I stepped in there, the memories washed over me. It was hard. My mom wasn't there, but she had given me permission to go. 'My two friends came in after me, they were supportive and gracious, but I could tell they were also taken aback by it all.' A few years later, she returned again with the man that would become her husband. And finally, in 2013, she and Geoff returned together. 'It was a really important moment for both of us I think,' she told DailyMail.com. 'To be there with someone who knew what you had gone through. We could talk about memories, and now that we're both parents we could reflect on how it affected us. Placing their children in the frames was a cathartic experience that, Jennifer says, helped her fully understand how she had been affected. 'Seeing my own daughter sat there in my room, even though she wasn't actually there, was a really big thing for me. 'You see it from an outside perspective: this is no place for a child. 'I don't think we really knew at the time. For children, it is an enormous, complex, emotional concept to get your head around.' The pair made clear that they continued to have a relationship with their mother until the day she died. It was the house, however, that left them with such difficult feelings. 'My mom worked hard, she had multiple jobs and children. I don't blame her for that,' Geoff says. 'But it was difficult for us.'\n","right_summary":"Geoff Johnson and Jennifer McShea both grew up with a mother who compulsively hoarded things.

{"document":"A clock based on a design from 300 years ago has stunned experts by keeping accurate to a second for 100 days. The modern-day Martin Burgess Clock B is based on John Harrison's 18th century clock, which he thought up to solve the problem of determining longitude at sea. It has been part of a 100-day trial at the Royal Observatory, in Greenwich, to see if the claim - that the clock would neither lose nor gain more than a second in 100 days - was true. The Martin Burgess Clock B (left), which is based on a design by carpenter John Harrison (right) from 300 years ago, has stunned experts by keeping accurate to a second for 100 days. The clock, which was built using modern materials, was initially set ticking a year ago after being strapped to one of the Observatory's supporting pillars. But it quickly became apparent the trial would be a success and wax seals were placed on its case so its accuracy could be verified, the Independent on Sunday reported. The time was measured using a radio-controlled clock, which received the national time signal, and the BT speaking clock. Jonathan Betts, a member of the Antiquarian Horological Society, said: 'As soon as we set the clock running it was clear that it was performing incredibly well, so then we got the case sealed because nobody was going to believe how well the clock was running.' He added that the clock was not a replica of Harrison's, but used his design and concept. 'It is important to realise his design goes against everything the establishment has claimed is the best throughout history,' Mr Betts added. The modern-day clock has since been certified by the Guinness World Records, which the National Maritime Museum confirmed on Twitter. The Martin Burgess B clock has been part of a 100-day trial at the Royal Observatory (above), in Greenwich, to see if the claim - that the clock would neither lose nor gain more than a second in 100 days - was true. The clock has since been certified by the Guinness World Records. When it was measured it was reading UTC time to within a quarter of a second. The National Maritime Museum confirmed the record on Twitter yesterday. It wrote: 'Our 100 day trail of \"Clock B\" won @GWR for \"most accurate mechanical clock with a pendulum swinging in free air\"!' Rory McEvoy, the Observatory\u2019s curator of horology, added: \u2018What we\u2019ve seen here is something approaching a perfect clock, but we are not there yet.\u2019 Harrison died in 1776. He has since been the subject of Dava Sobel's bestselling book Longitude, as well as a film with the same name starring Michael Gambon (right) and Jeremy Irons (left) John Harrison was a carpenter born in 1693 in Lincolnshire. In the early 18th century a lot of Royal Navy ships were being lost at sea. Although latitude was relatively easy to determine using the sun, longitude was harder. The problem was considered so important Parliament offered financial rewards of up to \u00a320,000 to anyone who solved it. Clockmakers argued that a heavy pendulum bob and short swing would be the best. But Harrison dismissed this theory and thought a clock with a lighter pendulum bob and wide swing would work better. He designed his first clock in 1713 aged 20. His 'longitude' clock, which was the basis of the Martin Burgess Clock B, would solve the problem of determining longitude at sea, he claimed. By knowing the amount of time the ship had been at sea and the local time by using the sun, sailors would be able to determine longitude accurately. Local time is one hour ahead for every 15 degrees of longitude east and one hour behind for every 15 degrees of longitude west. He was not taken seriously by any of his contemporaries and the possibilities of his clock were not explored until the 20th century. Harrison died in 1776.

{"document":"We belong to different generations and political parties. We live in different states and under different circumstances. One of us is a college student, born into a political family, while the other is a former congressman from South Carolina and father of five children. One of us served on the selection committee for the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. The other will receive this award in recognition of the stand he took when he broke with his party and sacrificed his political career to support responsible action to combat climate change. We share an unwavering belief that the United States must lead the world on climate change and seize opportunities for unity, growth and progress. We believe that President Kennedy's courageous leadership in space exploration holds lessons that can help guide us forward. In 1962, President Kennedy, speaking at Rice University, described the space program that he had first announced when he asked the Congress to support his ambitious goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the decade. Opening his speech, Kennedy stated simply the effect of man's scientific pursuit:  \"The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds.\" This curious paradox holds true today. Our knowledge of the causes and dangers of climate change has increased even as our ignorance of its ramifications has unfolded. Many of our elected representatives persist in inaction and complacency by arguing that individual nations are powerless to solve the problem because every nation is culpable. Others choose to dispute the science, deny the evidence, and avoid the question of how to solve the problem. But climate change is only scary if we choose to sit, wait and do nothing about it. President Kennedy encountered the same dilemma:  \"It is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest, to wait. But ... this country of the United States was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them.\" We need not be frightened today. Climate change is a chance for all of us to add a chapter to the story of American triumph and human progress. It is a moment for this generation to display the very qualities we attribute to the American political heroes of earlier times, who left the world a better place for us. Courage of this scale will come from a people who are told that they can do great things by leaders who believe that their people are capable of great things.  We believe that America will see opportunity in the danger of climate change just like we saw benefits on Earth from travel in space. Kennedy told the crowd at Rice that the pursuit of a goal that seemed impossible was valuable precisely because it would be so hard to accomplish. \"We choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard,\" he said. Something so difficult would only be achieved through cooperation and national unity, and it would push us toward greatness. There will always be reasons for inaction. Many will argue that responsible reforms will hurt our economy as it recovers from the Great Recession. They will exploit the fears of that time to justify extracting rents from industries and fuels whose days are numbered. Progress on climate change will require courage. Some leaders who stand up to meet the challenge may fall, but they can be sure that their sacrifice will light the world with more energy, more mobility and more freedom and ensure a healthier planet. We can start by making straightforward changes in the tax code that are acceptable to both the right and the left. By adopting policies that would make it in our trading partners' interest to join us, meaningful reforms can provide solutions without making government any bigger. As Americans, we are obligated to leave the world a better place than we found it. We believe, just as President Kennedy did, that only if America leads on the most important issues of our time can we deliver on that promise. We call on our elected leaders to embrace the climate challenge before us and light a path to greatness once again.\n","right_summary":"Profile in Courage award is going to a Republican congressman who risked his career while recognizing the danger of climate change.

{"document":"Richie Benaud spent a lifetime in the sun and in his final years he ruefully admitted that he was paying the price for it with skin cancers on his forehead and the top of his head. The 84-year-old, who died on Friday, talked about his cancer and the treatment he was undergoing with typical candour. 'When I was a kid we never ever wore a cap,' Benaud told the\u00a0Nine Network\u00a0about growing up in Australia in the 1930s and 40s. 'I wish I had.\u00a0You live and learn as you go along.' The cricket commentary box legend talked about the radiation treatment he was receiving for his skin cancer. Scroll down for video. Skin cancer: Richie Benaud, pictured at the SCG in January 2013, revealed late last year that he had skin cancer and was receiving radiation treatment, admitting that 'as a kid we never ever wore a cap' but using the opportunity to advise all Australians to cover their heads. Marvellous: Richie Benaud, pictured in 1961 in Britain when he was captaining the Test series, admitted last year that he had never worn head gear as a young player because he had been influence by legendary all rounder Keith Miller, saying 'when I was a kid, you never ever wore a cap ... that's because Keith Miller never wore a cap' Benaud, who hadn't returned to his commentary job for the Nine Network following a car accident in October 2013 in which he suffered serious injuries, had looked increasingly frail and had lost weight. But he had been out walking with his beloved wife Daphne for 40 minutes every morning, in the hope that he could return to work. Benaud had been driving his beloved car - a 1963 Sunbeam Alpine - back from hitting practice golf balls at the Australian Golf Club in Sydney when he\u00a0lost control and hit a parked car and then a small brick fence. He was hospitalised with shoulder, spinal and chest injuries and a broken sternum. He was subsequently diagnosed with skin cancer and began treatment last year, revealing that doctors were pleased with his progress. He told reporters last November he was 'coping with it very well'. The cricket legend said he believed the cancers were caused by playing cricket in the sun without a hat or sunscreen. Long history behind the microphone: Richie Benaud looks on during the fifth test match between England and Australia in August 1989, wearing one of his trademark light-coloured jackets which were his signature along with his unique commentary. Fan favourite: Richie Benaud was such a legend as a cricet commentator in his trademark cream jacket that he inspired a legion of fans dressed up in Australian cricket fans dressed up and wearing silver wigs and and carrying foam microphones at the Ashes Test at the SCG in January 2014. The voice of Australian cricket: Richie Benaud, pictured at The Oval during the September 2005 Ashes Test, was one of Australian sport's great personalities and the boss of the commentary box at Test matches in Australia and Britain. Richie Benaud, pictured with Worcestor captain Don Kenyon before an Australia v Worcester match in England, captained Australia and played 63 Test matches in the late 1950s and the early 1960s, helping to restore the country's reputation as a cricketing nation. What a catch: Richie Benaud, pictured with his beloved wife, Daphne, at  Randwick racecourse in 2007, said that following a serious car crash and then treatment for skin cancer he and Daphne had been walking for '40 minutes a day' to ease him back to good health in the hope he could return to the commentary box. The former Australian test cricketer seized on the opportunity to encourage Australians to protect themselves from the sun. 'I recommend to everyone they wear protection on their heads,' he said.\u00a0'Eighty-four-year-olds don't seem to mend as well as they used to.' He said he was still recovering from the car accident injuries which included two fractured vertebrae. However, he expressed the belief he would make a return to cover the fourth Test against India at the SCG in Sydney, and had been out walking with his beloved wife Daphne every morning in an effort to regain his health. Hero worship: Fans dressed as Richie Benaud in silver wigs and cream or beige sports jackets hold aloft imitation Nine Network microphones at the Sydney Test match in January 2014. Legend among legends: Benaud at the SCG with fellow cricketers turned commentators Ian Healey, Michael Slater, Brett Lee, Ian Chappell and Bill Lawry dressed in pink for McGrath Foundation day  during the Sydney test between Australia and Sri Lanka in January 2013. 'Progress is slow,' he said. 'I've been doing a lot of walking. 'We are out every morning, doing 40-minute walks every morning and it's showing beneficial effects.' Without the information on skin cancer danger now available during his playing days, Benaud revealed he was influenced by the example of great all rounder Keith Miller. 'When I was a kid, you never ever wore a cap - not a flash one,' Benaud said. 'That's because Keith Miller never wore a cap. Arthur Morris did when he went out to bat. 'We follow various people and 'Nugget' Miller never wore anything on his head, so I didn't. 'I wish I had.'\n","right_summary":"Richie Benaud revealed late last year he was suffering from skin cancer. He had radiation treatment for lesions on his forehead and top of head. He used the chance to 'recommend to everyone they wear protection on their heads' Benaud had looked frail  after suffering serious injuries in a 2013 car accident. After the crash and cancer treatment Richie Benaud was walking daily with wife Daphne. He hope to get fit enough to return to the commentary box but never did.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Richie Benaud, the famous cricket commentary box legend from Australia, passed away on Friday at the age of 84 due to skin cancers on his forehead and the top of his head caused by too much exposure to the sun. Prior to his death, he had been undergoing radiation treatment for his cancer and advised all Australians to cover their heads with caps. While recovering from the treatment, he had been out walking daily with his wife Daphne in hopes of returning to work, but unfortunately, he never made it back to the commentary box."}
{"document":"The idea of sustainable development is that raw capitalism is far too powerful for its own good. Global capitalism is a juggernaut, with the world economy now doubling in size every generation.  Yet on a finite Earth, with a billion new people being added every 15 years, that juggernaut is now laying siege to the physical bases of life and the social support systems that make life pleasant and decent.  Sustainable development offers a path out of this growing crisis. The reality is that raw capitalism is the economics of greed.  Unleash greed, the theory goes, and type-A personalities around the world will spend inordinate energy to organize businesses, invent new products, and thereby raise well-being. And in some sense, there's a lot to say for this theory.  After all, the world economy has expanded at least 100-fold since modern industrial capitalism first found its footing in Britain around 1800, and for most of the world, living standards have risen markedly along the way. Yet history has also taught us that the \"Invisible Hand\" of the free market is a little less miraculous than it looks. Instead, untrammeled greed also leads to massive fraud, mega-tax evasion, pervasive bribery, modern slavery, rising inequalities, and environmental destruction. Perhaps most important, it feeds moral blindness.  Too many of the super-rich, whether they are calling for drilling in the Arctic for oil or encouraging the cutting down of the rainforests for tropical hardwoods, simply deny the irreparable damage they are causing to the planet. It\u00b9s no surprise that the Wall Street Journal runs anti-environmental editorials on what feels like a daily basis.  The environment is a nuisance and a hindrance to greed.  And greed rules the moral order at the top of raw capitalism. Novelists, ethicists, activists, unionists, preachers, teachers, and others have long known these facts, but the juggernaut has proved hard to tame. Unleash greed as the supreme economic good, and it is greed that we get as the ultimate moral arbiter. Sustainable development is a doctrine that says: Let us once again place the economy on a true moral foundation and we'll keep greed within bounds, ensuring the economic growth is combined with social fairness and environmental sustainability. The idea of sustainable development is that an economy must satisfy all three principles: economic growth, social fairness and environmental sustainability.  Yes, there can and should be economic growth, especially for today's developing countries.  Human ingenuity and markets can indeed lead us to higher living standards and longer lives for all parts of the world, rich and poor alike.  But these gains should be widely shared and should never be based on the exploitation of those at the bottom of society.  Social inclusion has been widely shown to improve societal progress broadly for all.  And equally important, those gains should be based on true value added, not on the destruction of natural capital, whether through deforestation, climate change, or pollution of air, land, and water. Thus, sustainable development calls for a holistic approach that combines economic, social, and environmental objectives.  This balanced approach is much harder to achieve than the raw capitalism that places the economy above society and the physical Earth.  Yet it recognizes that we are doomed to conflict and even collapse if we fail to promote social equality and environmental sustainability. Just look at the recent news.  Last year was the Earth's hottest year on record, and another year of mega-storms, droughts, floods, and heat waves.  Major parts of the world, from Pakistan and Iran to California and Brazil, are experiencing mega-droughts, and the prospect of catastrophic water scarcity in the future unless something changes.  And even as the world economy grows and millions escape extreme poverty, our societies become more unequal, less trusting, and corrupt.  All over the world, there is unrest on the streets even as our generation is the beneficiary of unprecedented technological knowhow and material progress. In my new book, The Age of Sustainable Development, I\u00b9ve not only analyzed the trends of growing inequality and rising environmental destruction, but have also shown how the concepts of sustainable development can be used to chart a way out of our growing crisis.  It turns out that with goodwill, cooperation, greed kept in check, and technological savvy, we can build a modern global economy that is productive, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable all at the same time. The ongoing revolution of information and communications technology (ICT) is an incredibly powerful enabler of new sustainable technologies.  And doubters about the feasibility of sustainable development should have a look at Scandinavia \u00ac Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, as they are the closest on the planet to achieving this Trifecta of prosperity, fairness, and sustainability. Consider the challenge of climate change, for example.  Big Oil and Wall Street executives too often simply deny the science.  Yet a science-based sustainable development perspective shows that not only is human-induced climate change very real and very dangerous, but that it is also solvable at very low cost by switching over the next 30 years to electric vehicles, heat pumps, well-insulated buildings, smart ICT-enabled grid, wind and solar energy, and other low-carbon and energy efficient technologies. If the world takes the time to do its homework and plan for the future, the world can bring the climate crisis under control and still enjoy a growing supply of quality energy services. And, more generally, although the U.S. political system still feeds untrammeled greed by enabling super-rich campaign donors and lobbyists to buy the political class, the American people and much of the rest of the world are coming to recognize the urgency of sustainable development.  That is why governments around the world will adopt Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) this year, on the 70th anniversary of the United Nations. These new SDGs will become markers and guideposts for building a world that combines prosperity, fairness, and environmental sanity -- a world we truly want and need for ourselves and our children.\n","right_summary":"Jeffrey Sachs: Raw capitalism is the economics of greed.

{"document":"Brentford manager Mark Warburton was delighted to see his side triumph 4-1 against Fulham in a hard-fought west London derby at Craven Cottage. Stuart Dallas fired home two superb strikes while a sublime free-kick from second-half substitute Alan Judge and a late fourth from Jota ensured all three points. Brentford moved to fifth in the table on 69 points with six games left to play and remain firmly in play-off contention. Brentford boss Mark Warburton was delighted with his Brentford side's win over local rivals Fulham. Stuart Dallas scored twice to put the Bees in a commanding lead at Craven Cottage on Saturday afternoon. Warburton said: 'I'm really pleased. The first 10-15 minutes we were, not slow but it was a big local derby, the atmosphere was electric, but after that 15-minute spell I thought we were very good. 'I like the way we moved the ball and maintained pace and we were good for our lead at half-time. They were great strikes from Stuart Dallas but what disappointed me was their penalty, I thought it was as soft as they come and it changed the game. 'For the next 10 minutes the Fulham crowd were up and their players were naturally up as well and we had to defend stoutly. 'But then Judgey hit a tremendous free-kick and Jota got an outstanding fourth goal. It keeps us going. We are in contention, be that for top or the play-offs, we are still in with a chance. Brentford players celebrate after Jota put the result beyond doubt in injury time to make it 1-4. Alan Judge scored Brentford's third goal, helping the Bees move up to fifth in the Championship. 'We can't worry about what other teams do. I don't know how many points we will need. We can only worry about ourselves and make sure we do all the things we need to do.' Striker Ross McCormack fired home a 67th-minute penalty for Fulham, who remain 20th - seven points above the drop zone. Fulham manager Kit Symons added: 'It is a little bit of a recurring theme which is very frustrating. We are playing good football, creating chances, we are on top in games but are not making it count. 'When you get those situations in football you need to make it count, you need to get a goal. A lot of the time we are chasing at the moment. You saw it at the Leeds game. Brentford goalkeeper David Button lifts his arms to the sky in celebration at his side's fourth goal. Fulham boss Kit Symons admits his team aren't yet safe from relegation in the Championship. 'Ultimately people just look at the score line at the end of the game and 4-1 looks like a hammering but the actual fact of the matter is that it wasn't. 'We were well in the game but obviously we didn't get anything out of it. We shot ourselves in the foot for the first two goals. 'You need to get and press the ball, by being goal side you think you are protecting the goal. They were a couple of great strikes from them for a few of the goals but we didn't get out and press the ball.

{"document":"A car repair shop worker has been suspended after telling a customer's husband he needed to 'get her in check before there's a big f***ing problem' in a profane and threatening voicemail. Kyle Kandrick was suspended from the Maaco auto body shop in Hagerstown, Maryland after Ella May Rudd posted the voicemail left for her husband on Facebook. In the voicemail, Kandrick said:\u00a0'Hey, Billy, Kyle at Maaco here. I was just personally attacked by your wife on Facebook, and I don't appreciate it at all, pal.' Scroll down for video. Ella May Rudd points to the leak on her Hummer H2 that she was trying to have repaired at a Maaco auto body shop in Haggerstown, Maryland, before co-owner Kyle Kandrick left a threatening voicemail for her husband. 'So I want you to get her in check before there is a big f***ing problem here on my end. Understand me?' 'I did everything I could for her. She was in here Saturday and I explained everything to her the right way, and I don't like being attacked on Facebook.' 'I'm telling your right now: deal with it before I deal with it.' On her post, Rudd wrote that she had been dealing with the auto body shop for 'the last two months' while trying to repair a leak on her Hummer H2. She said that the voicemail was in response to a scathing review she had written on the company's Facebook page after her tenth unsuccessful trip to Maaco. 'Crooks, rude people, and liars. Please take your business anywhere else but here. I regret spending the last month and a half wasting my time with this company,' she wrote in the review. 'My car is still not fixed. They have charged me for car parts not needed, they have had me show up to multiple appointments and not have mechanics\/car ready, they have lied about multiple car repair events.' 'They are extremely unprofessional, and so much more. I hope this review at least stops a few people from being robbed and aggravated. So disappointed.' Rudd said that she paid Kandrick a visit on Saturday when she found out her car had still not been repaired. Kandrick called Rudd's husband after she left a scathing review on the shop's Facebook page. In the voicemail he said: 'I want you to get her in check before there is a big f***ing problem here on my end. Understand me?' Kandrick was suspended after Rudd posted the voicemail on Facebook and the post quickly went viral. She said that Kandrick was 'really rude' and blamed his workers. Rudd said she demanded she be returned the money she had been charged. 'I don't care whose fault it is,' she said she told him. 'It is your business that messed up and I need your business to fix it and to return my money that they just took.' She said Kandrick then claimed the shop didn't repair leaks, only to ask her to bring the car in again when a mechanic walked in and said the leak would be an 'easy fix'. Rudd said Kandrick also 'stormed out' of the room at one point and was talking to her 'like I was the biggest idiot ever'. The stay-at-home mother of two calls herself a 'strong woman', who had no problem confronting Kandrick herself after hearing the voicemail. 'I said to him, \"My husband will not handle me at all.\"' Rudd said Maaco President Jose Costa called her Thursday, the day after she posted the recording, and said he couldn't fire the employee because he's a co-owner of the franchise. Maaco officials didn't respond to questions from The Associated Press about that call. The company apologized to Rudd in a statement issued on Friday and said the 'employee at issue' would be suspended pending further review. Maaco added that he would be getting diversity and anger management training and that the shop would be temporarily closed 'in order to pursue customer care training for the team'. Rudd said the company has also offered to repair her car, but she's not interested. 'Maaco will not touch my car now,' she said.

{"document":"Thibaut Courtois has achieved a lot in a relatively short time, but the Chelsea goalkeeper is not resting on his laurels with the Premier League title in his sights. The 22-year-old has established himself as one of the world's best goalkeepers in recent years, impressing first for Genk, then Atletico Madrid and Jose Mourinho's side. Courtois' fine performances have helped bring with it collective success, with the Blues' recent Capital One Cup triumph making this a fifth straight trophy-winning season for the goalkeeper. Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois celebrates after Cesc Fabregas handed them the lead at QPR. The Belgian keeper produced an excellent performance as Chelsea moved closer to the title at Loftus Road. Courtois helped Chelsea to the League Cup earlier in the season and now wants to win the Premier League. Chelsea sit seven points clear of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League table. 2014-2015 (Chelsea) League Cup. 2013-2014 (Atletico Madrid) La Liga. 2012-2013 (Atletico Madrid) Copa del Rey, UEFA Super Cup. 2011-2012 (Atletico Madrid) UEFA Europa League. 2010-2011 (Genk) Belgian Pro League. The Wembley victory was good, he says, but having been substitute it would understandably be surpassed should Chelsea get over the line in the Premier League. 'Last season, I was part of a team who lost the Champions League in the last minute, so that's something I still want to win, and to be able to play for a Premier League title every season is also a big motivation,' Courtois told the club magazine. 'To win a European Championship or a World Cup with Belgium is another goal. 'But, it is true, when I was a young kid I dreamed of playing in finals and it's nice to have won the Europa League and Super Cup, and won a final against Real Madrid, but hopefully I can achieve much more now. 'Every year I've won one trophy, so it's nice we won the one at Wembley. 'But, of course, the Premier League would be much bigger so hopefully we can add that this season.' Courtois won La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Europa League during his three seasons at Atletico Madrid. His first season with Chelsea in the Premier League has been a success on the whole. There have been some embarrassing moments, such as being lobbed by Charlie Adam this month. Courtois joined Chelsea in 2011 but this is his first campaign with the club, having spent the past three seasons on loan at Atletico.

{"document":"If you were spellbound by the death-defying adventures of Katniss Everdeen, you will be very excited by the news that a Hunger Games theme park is in the planning. And fans could have the chance to experience Katniss' life as soon as next year, with the attraction expected to open in October 2016. But those looking to\u00a0wield\u00a0their bows and act as tribute will have to travel to Dubai for the chance to emulate the mockingjay. Hopefully the Dubai theme park will have safety measures in place for guests - unlike Katniss' experience in the arena in Hunger Games. The four million square foot Motiongate Dubai is set to attract over three million tourists annually, who will be\u00a0immersed in a cinematic journey through their favourite movies via 27 different latest-in-technology rides and attractions. Contrasting with the dramatic and nail-biting theme of the Hunger Games is the incorporation of a live stage show based on Step Up: All In and Step Up: Revolution, the two most recent films in Liongate's worldwide franchise. So far there have been three 'Hunger Games' films released, featuring Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence, grossing $2.3 billion at box offices worldwide. The final instalment, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, is debuting on Nov 20, 2015, and the theme park attractions will be open for fans less than a year later. Dubai Parks and Resorts Chief Executive Officer, Raed Al Nuaimi, said: 'We are thrilled to be working with a Hollywood studio whose creative resources, spirit of innovation and vision of the entertainment experience are so closely aligned with our own. 'Lionsgate's\u00a0Hunger Games, Step Up\u00a0and other signature properties are the perfect centerpiece for one of the most visionary new theme parks in the world. 'Through this partnership we are offering even more for the whole family to enjoy on their visit and are confident that Motiongate Dubai will set a global benchmark as the ultimate movie themed destination.' The theme park is set to open for Hunger Games fans in October 2016, and will include\u00a027 different latest-in-technology rides and attractions. The last movie in the Hunger Games franchise is set to be released in the US in November this year. Lionsgate has partnered with Dubai Parks and Resorts to bring a Lionsgate zone to motiongate\u2122 Dubai, the Hollywood-themed park opening in Dubai in October 2016. 'Motiongate Dubai is poised to become one of the most exciting new entertainment destinations in the world, and we're thrilled that many of our biggest franchises will be an integral part of it,' said Lionsgate Executive Vice President of Global Franchise Management and Strategic Partnerships, Kerry Phelan, and Senior Vice President of Branded Attractions, Jenefer Brown. 'The Lionsgate section of Motiongate Dubai is an important milestone in our ongoing commitment to extend the longevity, broaden the global fan base and enrich the vitality of our most exciting entertainment properties.' If the Hunger Games and Step Up attractions were not enough to draw the crowds, Dubai Parks and Resorts even have plans for Legoland Dubai, the first of its kind in the Middle East. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal Studios, Orlando, proved that if done correctly, theme parks can tap into a large movie fan base. Fans at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter can walk through a replica Hogwarts Castle, and enjoy three rollercoaster rides. Lionsgate were no doubt spurred on by the success of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, which opened at Universal Studios, Florida in 2010.

The truth is that nobody can live with Hamilton at the moment. He has got pole in every race this season and been impressively quick in each race. Lewis Hamilton waves after qualifying on pole position for the Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday and is flanked by Sebastian Vettel (left) and team-mate Nico Rosberg who qualified second and third respectivley. Hamilton made it four poles out of four this season under the lights at the\u00a0Sakhir circuit. Rosberg shook Hamilton\u2019s hand afterwards but kept his helmet on for longer than usual at the end of the session, no doubt contemplating how a Ferrari got between Hamilton and him. The last few minutes were dramatic. First Vettel set the fastest time, Rosberg failed to match it, before Hamilton swept to the front commandingly. The double world champion\u2019s smile was broad as he posed for pictures after taking his first pole in Bahrain. Rosberg was disconsolate. Qualifying proved that Ferrari are now in the championship fight, changing the dynamic for Hamilton and particularly Rosberg. Yes, it was pleasantly warm here but not sweltering hot, proving that Ferrari are not only fast in high temperatures. Hamilton in action during Saturday's qualifying session in Bahrain as he takes pole again. Jenson Button\u2019s misery continued. His McLaren broke down with him having done just one sector of one lap. His car was pushed away and he walked back through the paddock. He will start 20th and last \u2013 no place to start his 100th race for the team. \u2018It was a power cut,\u2019 said Button. \u2018I don't know where it came from. It's a shame because after practice we thought the car was doing pretty well.\u2019 Back in the garage Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman, shrugged his hands in disappointment. There was a twist of embarrassment to his reaction, too, given that the team\u2019s biggest shareholders are the Bahraini royal family. Ferrari's Vettel was beaten to pole by Hamilton by four tenths of a second as the Brit dominated. Vettel drives his car in the pit during the qualifying session for the Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday. Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, whose baby the race is, was watching from the tower. Guests at the circuit included \u2013 in no particular order \u2013 King Carlos of Spain and Sir Jackie Stewart. There was some slightly better news for McLaren with Fernando Alonso making it into the second session of qualifying. He will start 14th, a lowly spot but a big improvement on the team\u2019s poor start to the season.

{"document":"Former supermodel Christy Turlington Burns is championing the message 'It's what you do that defines you' for fresh-to-the-UK clothing brand, Lindex. The Scandinavian brand, which opened its first UK store in Westfield Stratford, London, on March 27, has also brought in 22-year-old German model Toni Garrn and Ethiopia-born Liya Kebede, 37. The models have been selected thanks to their work doing good things outside of the fashion world, showing that\u00a0true beauty comes\u00a0from\u00a0what you do as well as how you look. Scroll down for video. Christy Turlington, Liya Kebede and Toni Garrn are the faces of Lindex's Spring 2015 campaign. Lindex opened its first UK store in Westfield Stratford on March 27. 'I have learned that it\u2019s what you do, how you do it and what you do with what you have that matters,' said the yummy mummy, 46. 'I like that this campaign is providing a platform for each of us women - Toni, Liya and myself - at different stages of our careers who are all doing more with our lives than just modelling. 'I think it\u2019s a positive example to show that none of us are only as we may seem at a glance and that everyone has the capacity to do more.' Lindex wanted models who do good things outside of the fashion world for its campaign, so brought in Christy. Lindex is selling limited-edition #superrolemodel T-shirts to help raise money for Christy's charity, Every Mother Counts, as well as the Liya\u00a0Kebede Foundation\u00a0and Plan International's Because I Am A Girl. 'We chose to work with Christy, Liya and Toni as Super Role Models because we believe that the spirit they convey and the example they set will inspire our customers to consider the meaning of beauty \u2013 not only on the outside but the inside too,' said Lindex's Johan Hallin. 'The campaign message is that we can all do better.' Lindex is also raising awareness for WaterAid during its campaign with in-store activities and by donating 10 per cent from all sales during shopping events. All profits from the sale of limited-edition #superrolemodel t-shirts, pictured, will go to mum and child charities. Christy, who's gearing up for the London marathon on 26 April, told\u00a0Red Magazine\u00a0last week that giving birth has been her toughest physical challenge, but that now she's feeling 'stronger and healthier' than ever. 'Giving birth was probably the most empowering thing I\u2019ve ever done physically. I was like, now I can do anything. I can run a marathon\u2026 I can run three marathons!\u2019 Christy - who is mother to daughter Grace, 11, and son Finn, eight, with her husband of 11 years Edward Burns, 47 - had just given birth to Grace in 2003 when she was struck with a postpartum hemorrhage, causing her placenta to become embedded in her uterus wall. She suffered massive blood loss and was forced to undergo a painful procedure whereby the doctors manually tore her placenta free without pain relief - an experience that could easily have killed her had she not been in such good hands. Trauma: Christy, pictured with her husband Edward Burns, 47, had just given birth to Grace in 2010 when she was struck with a postpartum haemorrhage, causing her placenta to become embedded in her uterus wall. As a result of this traumatic experience, Christy founded the charity Every Mother Counts in 2010. \u2018What I realised was actually how lucky I had been that so many women don\u2019t even get to choose when they become pregnant.' 'They don\u2019t get to choose whether they will be medicated, or have a natural birth. This is just how it is, and it\u2019s not an ideal way to bring life into the world, I don\u2019t think.' According to the brunette stunner, 98 per cent of pregnancy-related deaths in the developing world are preventable. But, as she points out, the U.S. is one of the eight countries worldwide where maternal deaths are on the rise. Dedicated: According to the brunette stunner, 98 per cent of pregnancy-related deaths in the developing world are preventable - a statistic she's determined to change. Christy, who became famous alongside Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Linda Evangelista in the era of the supermodels, now runs marathons in aid of Every Mother Counts. She said she is determined to strengthen the 'sisterhood' between mothers around the world, wherever the happen to be.\n","right_summary":"Liya Kebede and Toni Garrn join Christy as 'Super Role Models' Scandinavian brand Lindex launches in the UK with Westfield store.

{"document":"A 23-year-old student who was\u00a0attending the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was struck and killed by a freight train just a few miles away from the event's California site, police said on Monday. Jannik Andersen, a student at the University of Colorado, was hit by the train in the 45000 block of Pacific Street in Indio, four miles north-east of Coachella's grounds, shortly after 3am on Saturday. He was pronounced dead less than 40 minutes later. Police have launched an investigation into the incident. It remains unclear why Andersen was on the train tracks instead of at the music festival. Tragic: Jannik Andersen (pictured), an attendee at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was struck and killed by a freight train just a few miles away from the event's California site, police said on Monday. Farewell: On Monday night, Mac DeMarco, a performer at the festival, took to Twitter to pay his respects to the fan, who was struck by a Union Pacific train. He told his 78,000 followers: 'RIP Jannik Andersen' Speaking to the Daily Camera, \u00a0Sergeant Deborah Gray, of Riverside coroner's office said it was too early to determine whether alcohol or drugs were involved in the Boulder student's tragic death. On Monday, friends were paying tribute to Andersen, who was  a non-degree seeking Continuing Education student from San Diego. They described him as a 'genuine' and always 'happy' man. Zac Hoffman, who also attends the university in Boulder, told the news site that the student was the 'happiest dude in the world', while\u00a0Cody Cooper said he was 'the most genuine and energetic' friend. Cooper added that Andersen had previously attended Coachella, and was especially excited to be joining the tens of thousands of people watching AC\/DC and Mac DeMarco at this year's event. 'He had the wildest and strangest taste in music, but they were always great tunes,' he said. Festival: Andersen, a student at the University of Colorado, was hit by the train on tracks in Indio, four miles northeast of Coachella's grounds, shortly after 3am on Saturday.

He thanked others for reaching out to him. Flying over: Douglas is among many of Andersen's friends to be flying to San Diego for his funeral this week. On Monday night, Canadian singer Mac DeMarco himself took to Twitter to pay his respects to the fan, who was struck by a Union Pacific train. He told his 78,000 followers: 'RIP Jannik Andersen'. At around the same time, Twitter user Jackson Moore posted a photo of Andersen beaming and drinking soda in the snow to the site, writing: 'Only met a couple times but u were full of love. He added: 'Use that big smile to guide those you left behind.' Andersen's many friends, who live as far away as Australia and Britain, are said to be planning to fly to San Diego for a funeral for the student, who graduated from Torrey Pines High School in 2009. Scene: The Riverside coroner's office said it was too early to determine whether alcohol or drugs were involved in Andersen's death.

{"document":"At least two people were taken into custody as protesters upset over the death of Freddie Gray scuffled Thursday evening with police on the streets of Baltimore. Tensions rose as demonstrators confronted police, several of whom shouted: \"Back up!\" The Baltimore Police Department said the two were detained for disorderly conduct and destruction of property. There were no other arrests and the protests -- on the whole -- were peaceful. Protesters rallied at City Hall before marching to a police station. Some walked through traffic. In one instance, they surrounded a police car. Gray died Sunday, one week after he was arrested by Baltimore police. At some point, he suffered a severe spinal cord injury. His family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died. \"The police have a lot of questions that need to be answered,\" Andrew O'Connell, an attorney for the Gray family, told CNN. \"What was the reasonable suspicion? Why were they arresting our client? These are pretty big questions that need to be answered.\" \"He had no weapon in his hand. He was committing no crime and he wasn't hurting anybody. The police had no reasonable suspicion to stop or arrest him,\" the attorney said. While Baltimore police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators, the department has not released details of what the officers said or how Gray might have suffered the fatal injury. Protesters are upset over the apparent lack of information, and -- recently -- a police union's comparison of the demonstrations to a \"lynch mob.\" \"While we appreciate the right of our citizens to protest and applaud the fact that, to date, the protests have been peaceful, we are very concerned about the rhetoric of the protests,\" the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 said in a statement issued Wednesday. \"In fact, the images seen on television look and sound much like a lynch mob in that they are calling for the immediate imprisonment of these officers without them ever receiving the due process that is the constitutional right of every citizen, including law enforcement officers.\" Scenes from Baltimore. That comparison drew swift and sharp criticism, given the history of lynchings of African-Americans in the United States. Rooted in the racial ire of the Civil War, the extrajudicial mob killings of blacks, other minorities and people opposed to oppression of minorities were common in the segregated South. More than 4,000 people were murdered between 1877 and 1950 in 12 Southern states, according to a recent report. But lynchings weren't restricted to the South, and they have deeply scarred race relations in the country. \"Which one is the #LynchMob again?\" John Cotton tweeted, posting a photo of a peaceful protest next to photos of Gray during his arrest and hospitalization. \"The choice of words is not only ironic, it's sad,\" said O'Connell, the attorney for the Grays. \"Police officers are never the subject of a lynch mob. It's actually usually the other way around,\" he told CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront.\" \"And in the context of the powder keg that Baltimore city is right now, referring to the citizens of Baltimore city who are peacefully protesting as a 'lynch mob' doesn't serve to keep the peace. It only heightens the flames, or fans the flames of people who are already on edge.\" Amid protests, officials advised people to clear the area or expect delays.  A statement encouraged employees who work downtown to get out of the area to \"avoid major disruptions.\" Baltimore police requested and received additional personnel from Maryland State Police. Thirty-two troopers arrived to help with crowd control and serve in a \"backup capacity\" for police, according to Erin Montgomery, a spokesperson for Gov.  Larry Hogan. A small rally and press conference was held at noon, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Peoples Power Assemblies. They announced that they will conduct their own investigation into the events that led to Gray's death. Thursday's events follow a series of demonstrations this week, with protesters demanding elusive answers. Baltimore protests: 5 questions demonstrators are asking. Among the questions: Did something happen inside the police transport vehicle that caused Gray's fatal spinal injury? And what took place in the 30 minutes before police called paramedics to pick Gray up? \"Our position is something happened in that van,\" police union attorney Michael Davey said. \"We just don't know what.\" But one question has already been addressed: Did officers have the right to chase Gray in the first place? Police first encountered Gray on April 12 as they patrolled an area known for crime and drug activity. When Gray saw them, authorities said, he started running. Gray's family attorney and protesters claim police didn't have any probable cause to chase him, but did so only because he was \"running while black.\" But Davey said officers had every right to give chase. \"There is a Supreme Court case that states that if you are in a high-crime area, and you flee from the police unprovoked, the police have the legal ability to pursue you, and that's what they did,\" he said. \"In this type of an incident, you do not need probable cause to arrest. You just need a reasonable suspicion to make the stop.\" Gray was arrested after police found what they said was a switchblade on him. An attorney for Gray's family has said the knife was a pocket knife of legal size. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said he met Thursday with the family. \"There was a lot of pain in that family, and I can understand it. If that was my son that ended up the same way, I would be angry,\" he told CNN. Updates and images from the field. One video of Gray's arrest shows officers dragging him to a police van, his legs dangling limply behind him. \"His leg look broke!\" a bystander yells as a witness captures the arrest on a cell phone video. That witness, who only wants to be identified as Kiona, said she knew Gray as a joker and a ladies' man. But that day, he said only one thing to her. \"When I ran up the street and seen him, the first thing I asked him was he OK because I heard him screaming,\" Kiona said. \"He didn't never say yes or no, he just said 'I can't breathe' and just was yelling.\" Former Baltimore Police Commissioner Leonard Hamm said he was disturbed by video of the arrest. \"What I see is a person in distress, and what should have happened is at that point, they should have called for medical attention to help him out,\" he told CNN's \"New Day.\" Hamm led the department from 2004 to 2007. He said he was surprised and disappointed by what has happened. \"I thought we were better than that,\" he said. \"I thought we were better trained than that.\" It's not clear whether Gray was injured during the arrest. His family has not yet seen the autopsy report, attorney William Murphy said. The medical examiner's office told CNN it could take up to 90 days to release the report, which is typical. Gray's body is now in his family's care and has been transported to a funeral home. The family has not specified which one.  That information will be released when arrangements have been finalized. Mary Koch, a member of the family's legal team, told CNN that an independent autopsy will be conducted at the facility. The police department is investigating what happened and will turn over its finding to the state attorney's office May 1, the department said. \"As with any criminal investigation, detectives will continue to pursue the evidence wherever it leads, for as long as it takes.\" The Justice Department is investigating whether Gray's civil rights were violated during the April 12 arrest. And Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she \"absolutely\" believes an outside investigation is needed, especially given the city's dark history of police misconduct. According to The Baltimore Sun, the city has paid about $5.7 million over the past four years to settle more than 100 cases of allegations of police wrongdoing. Police didn't admit fault in any of the cases. The police union said in a statement Wednesday that the reason for the settlements was simple: City officials believe lawsuits are too costly. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Catherine E. Shoichet, Kevin Conlon and Dana Ford contributed to this report.\n","right_summary":"Two people are taken into custody, but the protests -- on the whole -- are peaceful.

{"document":"Sky watchers in western North America are in for a treat: a nearly five-minute total lunar eclipse this morning. Here's how it's unfolding:. It started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow.  For the next hour and 45 minutes, that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time. The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds, and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century. Watch it live on NASA TV. While people west of the Mississippi River will have the best view, at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation. But sunrise will interrupt the show on the East Coast. Parts of South America, India, China and Russia also will be able to see the eclipse, but it won't be visible in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Africa or the Middle East. A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color.  Why red? Because Earth's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light. Some people have nicknamed the effect the \"blood moon.\" NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a \"tetrad.\"  The first was on April 15, 2014. The second was in September 2014, the next is Saturday and there will be one more, on September 28.

{"document":"An investor has paid a whopping $71.2 million for a sprawling Florida estate - just two weeks after he gave a speech that slammed the rising wealth gap in America. Paul Tudor Jones II, the billionaire founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, bought the Casa Apava estate in Palm Beach last week, the Palm Beach Daily News\u00a0reported. The Mediterranean-style seven-bedroom, 18-bathroom property was built in 1918 and has 420 feet of oceanfront access, as well as a tennis court, movie theater, swimming pool and gym. The hefty purchase came days after Jones, 60, warned that increasing inequality could spark a revolution as he gave a sold-out TED talk in Canada in March. Scroll down for video. New home? Paul Tudor Jones II, the billionaire founder of Tudor Investment Corporation,\u00a0spoke out against the rising wealth gap in America at a TED talk in Canada last month - and bought a $71m home days later. A spokesman for Jones declined to comment when reached by DailyMail.com. In the speech, the self-made billionaire called the current wealth gap 'disastrous'. 'The gap between the one per cent and the rest of America, and between the U.S. and the rest of the world, cannot and will not persist,' he said. 'Now here's a macro forecast that's easy to make, and that's that the gap between the wealthiest and the poorest, it will get closed. History always does it. It typically happens in one of three ways - either through revolution, higher taxes or wars. None of those are on my bucket list.' He said that while he is a proud capitalist because of the successes it has allowed him, he added that capitalism has become increasingly focused on short-term earnings,\u00a0CNBC reported. 'It's like we've ripped the humanity out of our companies,' he said. 'It's threatening the very underpinnings of our society.' Sprawling: The ocean-front home, which was built in 1918, has seven bedrooms and 18 bathrooms. Stunning: The\u00a0Mediterranean-style home has ocean views one side and views across a lake on the other. Impressive: As well as 420 feet of oceanfront access, the home has a gym, tennis court and boat dock. Peaceful: There is also a swimming pool, a pool house and a movie theater at the sprawling estate. Luxurious: The former owners previously sold off three other parts of the estate in separate sales. He has formed Just Capital, a non-profit that aims to boost justness in companies by asking people how they deem a company to be just - and then judging the top 1,000 firms against these criteria. Jones is married to Australian-born Sonia Klein, a former model who runs a chain of yoga studios in New York, and they have four children together. They live in Greenwich, Connecticut. He has an estimated net worth of $4.6 billion, according to Forbes, which ranks him at number 352 on its list of the world's billionaires. He is also one of the biggest philanthropists in the hedge fund world. He co-founded the Everglades Foundation, which strives to protect the Everglades in Florida, and established the Robin Hood Foundation, which aims to alleviate poverty in New York. It has raised and granted more than $1.45 billion to the poor. Jones, a graduate of the University of Virginia, has also given the college donations for a new basketball arena and various research facilities. Billionaire: Jones is pictured with his wife, model and yoga entrepreneur, Sonia Klein, in February 2011. Critic: In his speech last month, he said he is a proud capitalist because of the successes it has allowed him but that capitalism has become increasingly focused on short-term earnings - which needs to change. In the Florida sale, Jones bought the oceanfront part of the property, which sits on six-acres of land. Three lakefront sections of the estate were sold last year, earning its sellers, real estate developer Dwight C. Schar and his wife Martha, a total of $116.1 million. The amount for the entire property means it is the island's highest ever deal for an estate with multiple parcels sold separately, according to the\u00a0Palm Beach Daily News. The Schars bought the property from millionaire Ron Perelman in 2004 and 2005 for $85.6 million. The estate was originally designed by Abram Garfield, the youngest son of President James Garfield, in 1918 for U.S. Rep Chester Bolton and his wife, Rep. Frances Bolton. It was later restored and altered by Ferguson, Murray and Shamamian Architects LLP.\n","right_summary":"Paul Tudor Jones II, who is worth $4.6 billion, reportedly bought the oceanfront Casa Apava estate in Palm Beach last week.

{"document":"Malaysia has passed a controversial terror law aimed at tackling growing support for Islamic State extremists in the country in a move opponents denounced as a harsh blow for civil rights. The Prevention of Terrorism Act - passed in the capital Kuala Lumpur yesterday - officially enables authorities to detain suspected terrorists for two years without charge or trial. But it also allows for the authorities to apply for unlimited extensions after those two years expire - something that will be decided by a government-appointed terrorism board, not a judge and jury. The bill effectively reintroduces the controversial prospect of indefinite detention without trial in Malaysia - something Prime Minister Najib Razak originally repealed in 2012. Rise: Malaysian police said in January they had arrested a total of 120 people with suspected links or sympathies\u00a0to the Islamic State terror group (pictured), or who had sought to travel to war-torn Syria or Iraq. Razak's political opponents and human rights groups had urged for the bill to be withdrawn, claiming it is 'open to abuse and is a grievous blow to democracy'. Human Rights Watch described it as 'a giant step backwards for human rights'. The legislation was passed after midnight, following 15 hours of debate, according to media reports. Its passage was not in doubt due to the ruling regime's majority in parliament. Authorities have expressed increasing alarm in the wake of ISIS' bloody jihad in Syria, which police say has drawn dozens of recruits from traditionally moderate, Muslim-majority Malaysia. Yesterday police said 17 people, including two who recently returned from Syria, had been arrested on suspicion of plotting terror attacks in  Kuala Lumpur. No further details were given. International: Malaysian authorities have expressed increasing alarm in the wake of ISIS' bloody jihad in Syria, which police say has drawn dozens of recruits from traditionally moderate, Muslim-majority Malaysia. Police said in January they had arrested a total of 120 people with suspected Islamic State links or sympathies, or who had sought to travel to Syria or Iraq. They also said 67 Malaysians were known at the time to have gone abroad to join IS jihadists, and that five had died fighting for the movement. The terrorism act has heightened worries in Malaysia over a deepening crackdown on civil liberties launched by the government in the wake of a 2013 election setback. The ruling United Malays National Organisation has been in charge since 1957, but faces possible defeat at the hands of an opposition that has campaigned against government corruption and alleged abuse of power. Dozens of government critics, including opposition politicians, academics, activists, and journalists, have been hit with sedition or other charges after criticising the regime. Leader: The bill effectively reintroduces the controversial prospect of indefinite detention without trial in Malaysia - something Prime Minister Najib Razak (pictured) originally repealed in 2012. In particular, the terror legislation has revived concerns of a return to a previous draconian Internal Security Act that allowed detention without trial and was repeatedly used against opposition politicians. The ISA was scrapped in 2012 amid public pressure for political reform. 'The passage of this law is a giant step backwards for human rights in Malaysia that fundamentally calls into question the government's commitment to basic rights that are critical to the rule of law in a functioning democracy,' Human Rights Watch's deputy Asia director Phil Robertson said. 'Passage of this legislation raises serious concerns that Malaysia will return to practices of the past when government agents frequently used fear of indefinite detention to intimidate and silence outspoken critics.' The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has said previously the law would not be used against anyone over their 'political' views.\n","right_summary":"Law allows police to hold suspects for two years without charge or trial.

Concerns have been raised about the potential for abuse and the impact of such laws on civil liberties. Despite opposition from human rights groups and political opponents, the ruling regime has pushed ahead with the legislation as part of their crackdown on terrorism."}

Diana\u2019s final wishes for the disposal of her \u00a321.4 million estate are among a vast archive of wills dating back to 1858 now available to view online. Those of Winston Churchill and George Orwell can also be seen. In her will, Diana\u2019s butler Paul Burrell was bequeathed the sum of \u00a350,000, free of inheritance tax. Scroll down for video. The will of Princess Diana is among 41 million available to order at the click of a button thanks to a new service. Possessions including paintings and a clock were distributed among her 17 godchildren, while the rest went to her sons William and Harry. Qadir Ahmed runs the secure Iron Mountain facility in a leafy suburb of Birmingham where row upon row of the documents are kept in temperature-controlled storage, under tight security. He said the wills are a fascinating snapshot into the personalities and characters of people from every walk of life. For some, having a copy of a will is a matter of sentimentality, whereas others - particularly in the case of celebrities - are ordered out of 'pure curiosity', he said. 'We have 41 million in storage and there are so many fascinating and emotional stories,' said Mr Ahmed. One such is that of the late Paul Hunter, the champion snooker player, who died of cancer in 2006 aged just 27. Paul Burrell was given \u00a350,000 by Diana when she died. The Yorkshireman fathered a daughter who, at the time he penned his will, was not yet born but she is remembered in the passages of his will, as Mr Ahmed describes. 'There are some really touching stories inside these files - people like Paul Hunter, who in his will says 'To my unborn child, I leave ...' and that is genuinely touching. 'He believed at the time he was writing this will, that he wouldn't survive the birth of his child.' 'You feel the emotion of that moment, through reading the record.' The first disbursement of Diana's will reads: 'I bequeath to my butler Paul Burrell the sum of \u00a350,000, free of inheritance tax.' It also provides for specified keepsakes including watercolour paintings and a carriage clock to be distributed among her 17 godchildren, while to Princes William and Harry she left everything else. In the event of her death she makes express provision the Prince of Wales 'will consult with my mother [Frances Shand Kydd] with regard to the upbringing, education and welfare of our children'. She also makes clear her wish to be buried. Mr Ahmed said the new system, which has been in place since the end of last year, means people no longer have to order wills by post, or by heading to their local Registry Office. 'A lot of the public are not aware these are public records,' he said. 'Once someone goes through probate, that's it. It's a simple process, through the gov.uk website. 'You can pay a small fee of \u00a310 and order a record of anyone who's gone through probate, searching by the person's name and year of death.' Among the other celebrity wills, are those of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill, creator of Winnie the Pooh AA Milne and George Orwell - under his real name Eric Blair - who penned 1984. Data centre manager Qadir Ahmed inspects one of the more than 41 million public wills held in secure storage at the Iron Mountain facility in Birmingham. Churchill, who died in 1965, left an estate worth \u00a3266,054 which he asked to be divided between his wife and children. He gave his country home Chartwell, in Kent, to the National Trust to be a museum after his death. As well as other bequests of cash to his wife, children, family and friends, he also left money to his employees, including \u00a3100 for his gardener. His son-in-law, Arthur Christopher John Soames, was given 'such of my brood mares, followers and fillies' from Churchill's stable, but with the caveat his choices were \"not exceeding three in number, nor \u00a37,500 in total value'. Also stored away is the will of wartime code-breaker Alan Turing, recently played in Hollywood movie The Imitation Game by Benedict Cumberbatch. Turing's brief final testament directs his possessions be left to close friends and his mother. Meanwhile, Orwell - listed under his birth name Blair - left instructions 'no biography be written' and 'no memorial service be held for me after my death'.\n","right_summary":"Diana's will is among those stored in an archive which is to be put online.

{"document":"A 38-year-old man accused of strangling his wife, their 2-year-old daughter and their 8-year-old son  told a judge Wednesday that he wants to plead insanity. Timothy Fradeneck was arraigned on first-degree murder charges in the deaths of his wife and children, whose bodies were found Monday in their Eastpointe, Michigan home. He is also charged with child abuse. Authorities say that Fradeneck used a USB cord to kill 37-year-old Christine Fradeneck and the children, Celeste Fradeneck and Timothy Fradeneck III (called Trey). Scroll down for video. Emotionless: Timothy Fradeneck appeared in Macomb County, Michigan court on Wednesday, and was charged with first-degree murder and child abuse in the triple murder of his wife and two young children. Heartless: The bodies of Christine Fradeneck (top left), 2-year-old Celeste (being held by father) and 8-year-old Timothy III (called Trey, bottom left) were found Monday evening at the family's home in Eastpointe. Overwhelmed: Family members from both Timothy and his wife Christine's side of the family appeared in court, crying and hugging. They made no comments to reporters about the tragic loss. At Fradeneck's arraignment Wednesday, Eastpointe District Judge Carl Gerds III asked if he wanted to say anything. 'No, sir,' Fradeneck said. The judge then ordered him jailed without bond, and appointed him an attorney. 'I would like to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of mental insanity,' Fradeneck said. The judge then told him he had already ruled. 'I tried to kill myself,' Fradeneck said, adding, 'It wasn't about...' before Gerds cut him off. Sent to jail: Eastpointe District Judge Carl Gerds III ordered Fradeneck held without bond. He also shut down the 38-year-old from prematurely entering a not-guilty by reason of insanity plea. Confession: Fradeneck allegedly told police that he strangled his wife, 2-year-old daughter Celeste and 8-year-old son Timothy III to death with a USB cord. Pictured above entering court on Wednesday. Insane? Police said they also found medications prescribed to Fradeneck in the home, but would not say whether those were to treat any sort of mental illness. Scene: Above, the Fradeneck's Bungalow. Police said they found the wife and two children dead in their beds. Shaken community: Neighbor JeQuita Breham talks to the media as police block the street during the murder investigation on Monday. The judge scheduled a hearing April 28 in advance of a probable-cause hearing on whether Fradeneck will stand trial in Macomb County Circuit Court. If convicted on the three counts of first-degree premeditated murder, two counts of first-degree felony murder and first-degree child abuse, Fradeneck could stand to spend the rest of his life in prison. Police discovered the bodies Monday evening around 6:50pm after getting a call from Christine Fradeneck's sister, saying she was worried about her sister after not hearing from her all day. Police say Timothy Fradeneck opened the door and let the officers enter, insisting that his wife and children were sleeping. When officers refused to leave, they say Fradeneck copped to killing all three. Their bodies were found lying in their beds. Tragic loss: Fradeneck had been married to his wife for 16 years. Christine Fradeneck pictured above with her daughter in a photo posted to her Facebook. Young lives cut short: The two Fradeneck children were set to celebrate birthdays in the next two weeks. Planned? In court on Wednesday, prosecutors said Fradeneck had been planing the murder of his wife and two children since August. 'Timothy advised officers that his family was dead and that he had killed them by strangulation with a USB cable,' Detective Matt Hambright told the judge. Investigators also found medications prescribed to Fradeneck inside the home, but it not yet known if those drugs were to treat any sort of mental illness. Police said there was no history of domestic disturbance calls at the home. The Fradenecks had been married 16 years and their two children were set to celebrate birthdays in the coming two weeks. On Wednesday, prosecutors said Fradeneck had been planning the murders since August and killed his family sometime late Sunday or early morning when 'the opportunity presented itself.' Family members from both Fradeneck's side of the family and his wife's, appeared in court on Wednesday crying and hugging. The family members refused to comment on the tragic case outside the courthouse. The family issued a statement Wednesday, saying it was 'hopeful that the justice system will prevail and the person responsible for this will be punished to the fullest extent of the law.' Kate Fradeneck said her brother was dealing with a mental illness and asked the public to keep him in their thoughts. The family members have not elaborated on Timothy Fradeneck's mental illness. 'Even with the poor choices that he made, please remember he's also lost his family,' she told The Macomb Daily of Mount Clemens. 'No one knows or can understand the pain that he is in.' Since the bodies of Mrs Fradeneck and her two children were found Monday evening, a memorial of stuffed animals has been growing on the steps of the family's bungalow.

{"document":"8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. Noreen Spendlove was reassured when the results of her latest mammogram were normal. Noreen, then 68, had the scan as part of the NHS breast cancer screening programme, and as she says: 'As always, getting the all-clear was a big relief.' But 18 months later, shortly before her 70th birthday, the mother-of-three from Derbyshire developed intermittent pain in her left side, just below her breast. And although Noreen, a former administrator, wasn't concerned, her daughter, a radiographer, insisted she see a GP. Despite finding nothing abnormal, the GP referred Noreen for a mammogram. This revealed three lumps on her left breast, which were all tumours. Noreen is adamant: 'That GP appointment saved my life.' Breast cancer screening was introduced in 1988, with women aged 50 to 64 invited for a mammogram every three years. In 2000, the upper limit was extended to 70. 'I didn't realise it at the time, but at 68 I'd already had my last official mammogram,' says Noreen. 'It's all the more scary knowing that, because even though I check my breasts regularly, I definitely hadn't felt any lumps. Without my daughter, I wouldn't have gone to my GP.' Noreen was one of the lucky ones. MPs are warning that women will die as a result of the screening age limit. In a report published two weeks ago, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer pointed out that 8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. And while more are diagnosed at a younger age - 12,800 in their 60s and 10,600 in their 50s - more than half of the 12,000 women who die from breast cancer every year are over 70. So, extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis for those over 70 and more lives saved, the MPs said. In fact, the upper age limit is due to change. From the end of 2016, all women up to 73 will be invited for screening. But critics argue this is not high enough. Nat Lievesley, a researcher at the Centre for Policy on Ageing, says this cut-off point 'seems arbitrary', adding: 'It feels like a decision based on cost rather than what's best for women.' And the parliamentary group is concerned at the 'slow pace of change'. In 2013, they called for the age limit to be raised to at least 76, and possibly to 79. 'Extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis and more lives saved' 'While some progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to do in ensuring that older people with breast cancer receive the care, treatment and support most appropriate to them,' says Steve Brine, the Conservative MP for Winchester and co-chair of the parliamentary group. And this ageism is not limited to access to mammograms. There's evidence older women are less likely to get certain treatment for breast cancer than younger women. In 2013, researchers at the University of Sussex said women over 70 in the UK who are diagnosed with the disease have only a one-in-seven chance of receiving the chemotherapy that is standard treatment for younger patients. A study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, published in the British Journal of Cancer, reported that women over 70 are 12 per cent less likely to survive breast cancer after three years than women of the same age in Sweden, where screening in most of the country continues to 74. Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, last year warned: 'Around 2,000 deaths from breast cancer in older women could be avoided each year in England if survival rates matched the best in Europe.' It is \u2018shameful\u2019 to write off people as too old for screening and treatment, adds Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support. \u2018People should be judged on their health as an individual not just their age.\u2019 Ending screening at 73 \u2018doesn\u2019t take account of the fact that ageing is changing\u2019, adds Nat Lievesley. \u2018It\u2019s no longer a strong indicator of frailty. Just look at the role models for women in their 70s.\u2019 Yet the benefits of extending screening are not clear-cut, for there is a risk of women undergoing unnecessary treatment. A Dutch study, published in the BMJ in August 2014, suggested that inviting all women over the age of 70 for screening could result in 'over- diagnosis and overtreatment'. Researchers monitored 25,500 women aged 70 to 75 diagnosed with the disease after 1995, when breast cancer screening in the Netherlands was extended from 69 to 75. They found this had led to only a small increase in the discovery of advanced breast cancer, while the number of early-stage tumours detected increased considerably. For every woman found to have advanced cancer, another 20 would be diagnosed with small, slow-growing tumours that might not affect their life expectancy but would lead to major surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Lead researcher Dr Gerrit Jan-Liefers, of Leiden University Medical Centre, said: 'The chances of older women recovering from such severe treatment is far less than for younger women.' Older women are more likely to suffer from chronic health problems alongside cancer, he pointed out. 'So it may take them a year, a year and a half before they function normally.' For Noreen Spendlove, however, there is no question in her mind that screening should be extended. After her second mammogram in March 2011, she had a needle biopsy the same day, and two weeks later a mastectomy. The cancer had spread to her neck, so she was given six sessions of chemotherapy followed by a five-week course of radiotherapy. 'The treatment was murderous,' says Noreen. But as she prepares to receive the all-clear next year, she has no regrets about having this treatment. Indeed, her worry is that, once five years since her treatment have passed, she'll no longer be automatically invited back for screening as younger cancer survivors would be. In fact, women are entitled to request mammograms at any age - it's just the invitations that stop. Cancer charities warn that this gives the message that women no longer need to worry about breast cancer. Women are entitled to request mammograms at any age. An added complication is that older women are likely to be less 'breast aware' and more cautious about bothering their GP, the All-Party Parliamentary Group pointed out previously. Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, says: 'It's clear from calls to our helpline many older women believe that because they aren't being invited, they are no longer at risk.' Jackie Woods, 57, a local government officer from Forest Hill, South London, agrees this can be a problem. Her mother, Betty, celebrated her 88th birthday last month after undergoing treatment for breast cancer four years ago. Betty had diligently booked herself in for regular mammograms, despite no longer being invited for screening - but she was rare among her peers in doing so. During November 2011, Jackie was diagnosed with breast cancer after her regular mammogram. The diagnosis reminded Betty to request another scan for herself, and in June 2012 she was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer and had a mastectomy. Rather than simply ending screening, the Dutch researchers who suggested that extending the programme to all older women could do more harm than good, say the decision whether to continue scans should be personalised to each woman. This should be 'based on remaining life expectancy, breast cancer risk, functional status and patients' preferences', says Dr Jan-Liefers. Another way forward, says Jane Murphy, is for women to be reminded at their last screening that they are entitled to further ones. 'They should be given a card that informs them that they can continue to take advantage of regular screening. But it doesn't always happen.' Noreen Spendlove was given no such card. 'It's terrifying to think that the cancer might not have been picked up,' she says. Breast Cancer Care helpline: 0808 800 6000 or breastcancercare.org.uk.

It is alarming that the Dutch researchers have shown that extending the programme to all older women could potentially do more harm than good. It is, therefore, essential to prioritize women's remaining life expectancy, assess their functional status, determine their breast cancer risk, and patients' preferences before continuing scans. In fact, despite the risks involved, having routine mammograms in younger ages is necessary and will help save more lives."}
{"document":"The family of a Syrian imam who was shot dead on a London street have paid tribute to 'the most peaceful man you could ever wish to meet' as counter-terror police continue to investigate his murder. Abdul Hadi Arwani, 48, a fierce critic of president Bashar al-Assad, may have been assassinated by the governing regime in his home country, according to friends. The father of six was found slumped in a Volkswagen Passat with wounds to his chest on a street in Wembley on Tuesday morning. Last night it emerged that Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism officers, who handle political assassinations, were now leading the inquiry because of its potential 'international dimensions'. Scroll down for video. Outspoken: Abdul Hadi Arwani had taken part in a demonstration against President Assad three years ago. His son Murhaf issued a statement on behalf of the family, calling for witnesses to come forward and paying tribute to the political dissident who fled Syria after being apparently sentenced to death by Assad's father. 'My family and I have been in a state of shock ever since we learned of this terrible news,' he said. 'We have not slept and our minds are a blur as to what happened and why. 'The police are currently investigating this brutal murder. As an individual, a family and a community, we are helping the police to solve this heinous crime.' Murhaf continued: 'He was the most peaceful man you could ever wish to meet. He just loved to help people. He did not care what your background, race or status was. 'He did not care if you were rich or poor. He just wanted to help people in need. 'He was an old fashioned man who thought love and understanding could cure all of the world's ills. He was always smiling and joking with everyone he met. 'He showed so much love to his congregation and to his community as an imam and a loving father to us, his six children. I don't know how we will cope without him.' Imam: Mr Arwani was a preacher at the An-Noor Mosque (pictured) in Acton, West London, which has a reputation for hosting fundamentalist speakers. The statement said Mr Arwani was a 'peaceful man' who was 'actively involved in the fight against extremism'. 'He spoke up and out against the crime of terror and oppression wherever he found it,' it said, adding that Mr Arwani was 'a British citizen who loved the people of this country'. Murhaf added: 'He loved the idea of democracy and freedom. He loved the idea of freedom for all regardless of religion, race and background.' A source has claimed that the killing had all the hallmarks of a 'state-sponsored assassination', while a friend laid blame at the feet of 'Assad and his cronies'. Last night, the Metropolitan Police said detectives from its counter terrorism command are carrying out the inquiry 'because of their expertise in the management of investigations with international dimensions and an established liaison network abroad'. Mr Arwani was an imam at the An-Noor Mosque in Acton, West London, but was forced to step down last year over reports it was repeatedly linked with extremists. He was found with gunshot wounds to his chest in Wembley on Tuesday morning. He was declared dead half an hour later. His daughter Elham Arwani said her father ran a building company and had been visiting Wembley in connection with his work. Speaking from the family home yesterday, the 23-year-old said: 'We have no idea what happened. We don't even know how he was killed. We have just been told he was killed and that's it. 'Any Syrian who is free and who knows the truth is against Assad. It's not going to be because he was against Assad. It must be for another reason, but we can't think of anything.' She described her father as a 'loving father and husband' and added: 'He was the best person, always helping everyone. His phone would ring 24\/7 with people asking for help and advice.' At least 200 mourners gathered to pay tribute to him last night at Nadi Park Royal in Willesden Junction, north west London, where he preached every Wednesday. Preacher: Mr Arwani was known for his outspoken opposition to the Assad regime. Mourners\u00a0claimed the  imam was a peaceful man who opposed extremism. Some speculated that he may have been killed in a hit from the Syrian regime or because of a disagreement over management of the west London mosque. One also said that he had visited Syria 10 times in recent years but had been ordered by the Turkish government to stop and had been questioned by security services at an airport there. Dr Khaled Kamaraldi, who gave Arwani his first job as a builder 15 years ago, said: 'He went out to Syria to educate the fighters about the treatment of prisoners of war and about human rights. 'He said if you behaved like the Assad regime you become like them. He was questioned by security services but they let him go. He said everything in his heart.' He added: 'This was a state kill. Assad was behind it, and if not Assad one of his cronies. He was very active against the Assad regime. But he was a conciliator, he was not violent. 'What shocks me is they shot him in broad daylight in the centre of London. They have no respect. There is no doubt the police will get him.' Home: Mr Arwani, originally from Syria, lived in this home in White City, west London. One friend, solicitor Mohammad Bassam Tablieh, 43, from west London, said there could be 'two reasons behind his killing'. He said: 'Number one: a dispute about running the mosque. Number two: his activities against Assad. He was an active member of the opposition against Assad. 'There was a problem with dealing with who is imam at the mosque. He had nothing to do with extremism at all he was a very moderate person, very peaceful.' He added that many people in London who had green flags in there car as a symbol of being anti-Assad have had their tyres slashed but did not know if Mr Arwani had one in his vehicle. But Haras Rafiq, managing director of anti-extremist think-tank the Quilliam Foundation, said it was too early to start speculating about why Mr Arwani was killed. He said: 'He was definitely anti-Assad, he was very vocal and we all know that. But he wasn\u2019t necessarily Assad\u2019s biggest enemy here in the UK. I am just thinking \"Why him?\" and not other people that we know are more vocal and more active. 'They have got other problems, more serious problems in Syria. If the murder was carried out on behalf of Assad, then that would suggest that they are looking at people abroad, but it is not something that I have come across.' Mr Rafiq added: 'Arwani himself wasn\u2019t actually extremist. He wasn\u2019t on my radar as somebody who himself held extreme hatred-based views. However, the centre that he was involved in was quite controversial.' Mr Arwani was involved in violent anti-Assad demonstrations outside the Syrian Embassy in London in 2012. Mr Arwani\u00a0grew up in Hama, the site of a notorious 1982 massacre where up to 40,000 civilians were killed by the Syrian Army under the orders of Hafez al-Assad, the current president's father. In a lecture he gave in 2012, Mr Arwani described how the Assad regime had sentenced him to death, forcing him to flee his homeland, and then harassed his elderly relatives for three decades. Mr Arwani, who was just 16 at the time, said that he took a series of photographs chronicling the damage done to mosques and houses in the city, and was sentenced to death by the authorities for it. 'When they found out that I did that, they issued a capital punishment against me, when I was 16 years old - so I had to flee from Syria,' he said. The teenager bribed a policeman so he could leave the country, he said - but for the next 30 years, the authorities questioned his parents once a month in an attempt to find out where he had gone. Mr Arwani blamed the atrocities carried out by the Assad regime on its supposed abandonment of Islam, saying that from the 1960s the government 'started to implement atheism, and take off Islam from the life of the people'. He also claimed that Muslim scholars were forced to stop working as imams, and told to take jobs selling cosmetics instead. The Assad regime has been known to assassinate its political opponents in the past, most prominently the Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri, whose killing in 2005 was blamed on the Syrian government. The An-Noor Mosque, where Mr Arwani used to be one of the main imams, has a reputation for hosting fundamentalist speakers. The mosque became notorious in 2013 when a terror suspect went there and changed into a burqa in order to escape surveillance then went on the run. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed has been missing for 16 months, and was last seen entering An-Noor dressed as a man before leaving in a full-length covering designed for women which obscured his identity. He was subject to a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure, which restrict the movements of people suspected of involvement in terrorism. Other extremists linked to the mosque include Uthman Mustafa Kamal, the son of hate preacher Abu Hamza, who has regularly led prayers at An-Noor. Three years ago, another preacher delivered a sermon arguing that 'Jews, Zionists, all of those people' who mock the prophet Muhammad deserve to face 'the sword'. Some friends of Mr Arwani said that he had left the mosque after a dispute about money, despite reports that his departure was linked to extremism. Ali Belai said: 'Nothing he said was ever extremist. The management forced him out of the mosque. There was conflict over money. I think it was about \u00a330,000.' Anas Qamar, another Syrian exile, said that Mr Arwani had been involved in a High Court battle over the mosque's finances when one of the trustees allegedly embezzled money from worshippers. 'Abdul Hadi said the mosque was a charity and should not be run to profit one man,' he said. 'He was banished by the mosque.'\n","right_summary":"Abdul Hadi Arwani\u00a0was found dead in on a street in Wembley on Tuesday.

Warning:\u00a0MI5 has issued an alert over the threat posed by rogue workers in Britain\u2019s nuclear, transport and public services after co-pilot Andreas Lubitz killed 150 people in the Alps plane crash disaster. Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who was being treated for depression, was able to override a security system installed on flights following the 9\/11 attacks as he flew the aircraft into the ground. Guidance issued by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI), a security agency accountable to the director general of MI5, recommends continuous psychological assessment of key employees, with the highest priority given to workers whose jobs pose the greatest risk to the public. But a BA pilot, who has been with the company for several years and flies regularly around the world, claimed the airline did not carry out mental health checks. The pilot, who did not wish to be named, said: \u2018British Airways is more interested in checking whether I have a hernia than mental health. \u2018There is no testing regarding mental health.\u2019 A BA spokeswoman refused to discuss details of health checks carried out on pilots. The CPNI has identified a number of motives for employees becoming an insider threat, including theft, revenge, a hunger for notoriety, political or religious ideology and fear or coercion, where external pressure is exerted on a worker. Rescue workers and investigators work near debris at the crash site of the Germanwings Airbus A320. A CPNI study showed that three-quarters of insider acts were carried out by employees who had no malicious intent when joining the organisation, but whose loyalties changed after recruitment. Disturbingly, it also found that in many circumstances the workers had been in their organisation for some years before going rogue. Some of the more common insider acts include unauthorised disclosure of information \u2013 such as in the case of US whistleblower Edward Snowden \u2013 process corruption (where an employee illegitimately alters an internal process for their own ends) and corporate espionage. The security source said: \u2018Years ago, the emphasis was on external security. Now \u2018\u2018the insider\u2019\u2019 is the growing threat, as seen in the cases of Edward Snowden and Lubitz. \u2018We advise companies to look closely at their personnel. The higher security clearance they gain over their time of employment, the closer they should be monitored.\u2019\n","right_summary":"Alert issued over rogue workers in nuclear, transport and public services.

{"document":"Anti-Islam protests in Australia against Sharia law and halal tax turned violent after demonstrators clashed with anti-racism activists who burned the country's flag. Police were forced to separate the Reclaim Australia supporters and opponents of the group in Melbourne, after clashes turned ugly and several people had to be treated by paramedics. The protests came as companies seeking to label their foods halal - must pay fees to Islamic organisations for inspection and certification. Scroll down for video. Anti-Islam protesters clashed the anti-racism activists during a rally in Federation Sqaure in Melbourne yesterday. Across Australia, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, but Sydney and Melbourne drew the biggest crowd. Several were injured during the violent rally that saw hundreds of people protest for anti-racism. Two people were arrested in Melbourne after they attempted to break through a police barricade that separated the groups. Recent figures show the halal sector could be worth $1.5 trillion worldwide by 2050. Across the country, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, with events in Sydney and Melbourne appearing to have drawn the biggest crowds. About 500 people attended the rally held in Martin Place, Sydney, which included speeches from former Australia Defence League member Shermon Burgess and Rise Up! Australia Party NSW President Norm Bishop. There was a strong police presence throughout the protest, which included riot police. Two people were taken away by officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally. One took the microphone and told the crowd they should be 'ashamed'. In Melbourne, protesters clashed with anti-racism activists in Federation Square. Two people were arrested after they attempted to break through a police barricade that separated the different groups. A clash of anti-Islam and anti-racism groups turned dangerous and violent during protests in Melbourne. More than 100 police officers, eleven mounted on horses were used to form the separation wall. Melbourne police formed a barrier between the separate rallies to attempt to disperse the protesters. Anti-racism supporters burn Australian flag at in retaliation to the Reclaim Australia protest in Melbourne. Protesters clashed with anti-racist activists in Melbourne as tensions rose. Several more were injured in the combative protests, according to reports. The protests came as the Pauline Hanson, leader of One Nation, far right Australian political party, defended the anti-Islam protests and said imposing halal certification on Australians was wrong. On Sunday morning's Today show she was asked for her views on businesses 'going to the wall' if halal certification of food products was scrapped. 'It's a profit, money-making racket and has been connected with the Muslim Brotherhood in France. Why can't we have an investigation into where the money actually goes?' she claimed. When told by the interviewer that there was no basis to any of these claims Ms Hanson replied: 'Why do Australians have to pay tax for halal certification? It is a money making racket. Why do Australians have to pay extra when they buy this product?' Crowd numbers grew during the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics. Two people were taken away by police officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally. Ms Hanson added that an investigation was needed into halal certification in Australia. 'It's extortion that has been put onto businesses that you must pay this money,' she said. 'A Muslim does not have to have halal certification, they can say a prayer over their food. Then it's OK. 'We don't need this, we're being hoodwinked. It's a racket, a money-making racket.' Ms Hanson, who narrowly lost her fight for a seat in the 2015 Queensland election, joined hundreds of protesters in King George Square in Brisbane on Saturday. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson denied that there was any violence or confrontations at the Brisbane rally. Speaking earlier on the Today programme Mrs Hanson\u00a0defended the anti-Islam protests and said imposing halal certification on Australians was wrong. Many were draped in the Australian flag and carried signs denouncing sharia law and halal certification for Australian products. She denied that there was any violence or vitriol at the rally. 'There was no violence at the Brisbane rally whatsoever. Islam is not a race so therefore we're not talking about racism here whatsoever. Criticism is not racism. We have a right to have a say and have an opinion,' she said. 'We don't like Islam and we're in fear about what Islam can do to our country, our culture and our way of life. Australians have a right to say this is not going to work. We want a peaceful cohesive society.' The violent scenes came after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups has mocked protests being held around Australia. Hundreds of people attended the 'Reclaim Australia' rally which was held in Martin Place, Sydney. Protesters in the crowd carried flags and chanted  \u201cAussie, Aussie, Aussie - Oi, Oi, Oi\u201d and many carried banners denouncing Islam. It was originally thought Reclaim Australia had handed over the reigns to one of their supporters to control their feed throughout the protests. 'Whats wrong with muslims anyway? I dun get it,' one tweet from the account read. 'In the car reading stuff - wots xenophobia? help me out,' another said. However, 'Jeremy' began to tweet a number of joke comments shortly after the Sydney protest got underway. 'Man f**k this noise I'm gonna get stoned in the park peace out.' Once the tweets began to get attention, a 'statement' was released that explained its account was misused and it then said other events around the country would be cancelled. Two people were taken away by officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally. Protesters cheered as speakers said Australians had to be aware and alert to the threat of Islam and sharia law. However, organisers behind the Sydney protest were quick to disassociate themselves with the account. 'It's not us,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Ours is @reclaim_aus.' Twitter users quickly began to poke fun at the group after doubts over the page emerged. 'Maybe before you you practice on something small like reclaiming your Twitter account. Work up to the big stuff slowly,' one said.\n","right_summary":"Protesters\u00a0clashed with anti-racism activists at rallies across Australia.

{"document":"Gareth Bale has been urged to ignore a return to the Premier League and persevere at Real Madrid by former Wales manager Mark Hughes. The world's most expensive player has endured a difficult second season at the Bernabeu. Despite starring in both the 2014 Copa del Rey and Champions League finals, the 25-year-old has become a figure of frustration for fans this term. The Welshman has been linked with English clubs including Manchester United and Chelsea but Hughes, who regrets only spending a single season in Spain, believes Bale should stay with Los Blancos. Gareth Bale has come under fire from fans in his second season at Real Madrid. The Welshman missed the Champions League quarter-final return against Atletico after picking up an injury. Bale, who won the Champions League in his first season, has been urged to stay at Real by Mark Hughes. 'He's done everything right up to this point and having a huge impact over there but if he can, stay as long as you can,' Hughes told the BBC. The Stoke manager played with former England striker Gary Lineker under Terry Venables for one season at Barcelona in 1988. Hughes struggled at the Nou Camp before being loaned to Bayern Munich, although that has not prevented him from advising his countryman to stay. Javier Hernandez celebrates after scoring a late winner to send Real into the Champions League semi-finals. 'It's such an opportunity,' he said. 'From my own personal experience I made the mistake of thinking 'I'll just go for a couple of years and I'll be back home and continue my career' which is totally the wrong approach. 'When you get the opportunity to go to a club such as Barcelona or Real Madrid you've got to go with the intention that you're going to try and stay there for as long as you can until they actually kick you out of the door. Hughes believes that Bale has the advantage of having a good family support unit with him in Spain. 'I went there when I was 23 but I was a young 23. I wasn't married and I'd only just met my wife-to-be a couple of months before. 'It was difficult - I was out there on my own at times. 'If you have a good support network, which by all accounts Gareth has over there, I'd say stay as long as you can because you'll look back and think what a great experience that was.\n","right_summary":"Gareth Bale has endured a difficult second season at Real Madrid.

Roma had initially defended strongly, but capitulated after the break. Chelsea made two changes from the side that started the quarter-final victory over Atletico Madrid last month, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Charly Musonda coming into the line-up. Andreas Christensen, who started in midfield against Atletico, was paired with Jake Clarke-Salter at centre-back, while Ola Aina and Jay DaSilva occupied the full-back positions.

The first came at the end of a driving run from Brown, which saw the ball bounce kindly into the path of Colkett for him to wrong-foot the goalkeeper with an awkward shot. A second goal followed from Christensen's excellent long ball forward, met by the run of Solanke who rounded the rushing keeper to fire into an empty net. After Boga had an attempt spilled by the keeper, Solanke was on hand to poach his second and Chelsea's third. Solanke has now netted 11 goals in this year's Youth League and is the competition's leading scorer. The rout was completed when Abraham, on from the bench, converted Kasey Palmer's cross.

Felix was discovered at JFK airport after being on the loose for more than two weeks.

Jennifer Stewart and husband, Joseph Naaman, pictured with their cat, Felix, who disappeared April 1. Facebook updates: Ms Stewart updated her friends after hearing the news that Felix the cat had been found. The couple had launched a desperate search for their pet after he disappeared following a 14-hour flight from Abu Dhabi to New York. Felix the cat was missing for more than two weeks after he escaped from his crate, which was damaged in transit. The two-year-old grey tabby's crate was travelling in an airline-approved carrier but it was damaged so badly \u2013 apparently while being transferred from the plane  \u2013 that Felix was able to get out and run away. Found! Felix the cat was discovered at JFK airport after being on the loose for more than two weeks. The releaved couple were alerted that a cat had been been found at the New York airport.

Jennifer later added: 'Joe picked him up at JFK and they are on their way home to Princeton right now. So HAPPY!!!! Thanks to everyone for your help and positive energy these last two weeks! We're incredibly grateful for such love & support! xo' Jennifer and Joseph never gave up hope and planned to return to the airport to search for Felix. The couple was told that the plastic crate broke open after one of the ropes became tangled on something. At the time of the disappearance, Jennifer had told MailOnline Travel that she wasn't satisfied with the way Felix's crate was secured and transported on the Etihad Airways flight. She said his crate was tied down to a large metal pallet and cracked open, apparently when one of the straps got caught on something as it was being moved to a cargo bay after the April 1 flight. She said: 'To find out how he was transported, I was horrified, I was sick.\u00a0They basically strapped him in like he was an old box. 'If I had known he was going to travel like that we would have looked for other alternatives. 'He is a part of our family. He's like a dog. He plays fetch and hide and seek, and he's the coolest little cat.' Jennifer wasn't sure which company was responsible for transferring Felix from the plane, but a cargo manager called her and her husband into an office after they landed to deliver the bad news. 'We were in shock that this happened. At first I thought he was going to tell me that [Felix] died. 'He told me his cage was crushed.' Felix's plastic pet carrier was tied down to a metal pallet while he was transported on the plane. Felix the cat disappeared after his crate was damaged after a flight from Abu Dhabi to New York.

Jennifer, a yoga instructor, and Joseph, a strategy consultant, couple spent $1,200 (\u00a3800) to bring Felix  to the US with them after living in the United Arab Emirates for three years. They adopted him seven months ago after they found him wandering on the street in their Abu Dhabi neighbourhood, and they never gave any thought to leaving him behind. The couple adopted the two-year-old cat seven months ago after he was abandoned in their neighbourhood. Jennifer and Joseph have enlisted the help of a non-profit organisation to locate the cat at JFK Airport. The couple never gave up hope that Felix would be found, and sought help from a non-profit organisation, Where Is Jack?, which provided a dog that is trained to track down animals based on their scent. They had previously searched the airport, but were initially unable to access secure areas. An Etihad Airways spokesperson told MailOnline Travel at the time of the disappearance that it was investigating Felix\u2019s disappearance and continuing to search for the cat. The spokesperson said: \u2018We are working with the ground handlers and other third-party specialists, paid for by Etihad Airways, to locate the cat. Etihad Airways said it is working with ground handlers and 'third-party specialists' to find the cat. \u2018We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search. \u2018We will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident, as the safety and care of pets travelling with Etihad Airways is a top priority.\u2019 Etihad cargo carries more than 200 animals each year and it is \u2018extremely rare\u2019 for one to escape, the spokesperson added.\n","right_summary":"Felix the cat was found two weeks after going missing in transit.

The jail, once home to men and women detained for petty crimes, will now provide a luxury night's stay for guests looking for a room steeped in history. The Grade II listed building was previously known as Bridewell Prison in Liverpool, and housed inmates for court appearances and short sentences. Bridewell Prison in Liverpool is being developed into a luxury hotel where guests won't mind spending the night. The grotty jail was once home to men and women detained for petty crimes, and is now undergoing a dramatic facelift. The rooms have being transformed into bright and airy abodes, a far cry from the desolate and dark cells they once were. The prison was completely secure and a plaque on the wall, which remains in the reception area today, reads: 'Please do not ask for bail because a refusal often offends.' But the thick lead paint has been stripped from doors and brick walls, exposing traditional brickwork and original iron work features and the exercise yard, once open to the elements, has been converted into a glass covered indoor lounge space. The quadrangle of former cells across four floors has been transformed into slick modern rooms complete with hi-spec en suite bathrooms, LED Smart TV's and art work of famous ex-cons. Bridewell Prison was constructed in 1857-1859 by Corporation Surveyor John Weightman, and was originally designed as a police station and courts complex for the Corporation of Liverpool. The development has maintained much of the historic character of the prison, while offering chic style and comfort. Rooms come complete with photos of former inmates, as well as a kettle and right, spikes that were used as anti climbers in what would of been the courtyard which is now being transformed into a lounge. How the cells used to look like; but now they are somewhat more inspiring and will offer a better night's sleep. At different times, it had 60-90 cells, each measuring 7ft x 7ft with a heavy wooden door, 3ft thick brick walls and stone floors.\u00a0Each cell had a toilet that was positioned at the end of a wooden bench where a prisoner would have to sleep. There were tunnels underneath the prison, leading to the old courts at St George's Hall and directly to the docks. These still remain, although it is thought they have been blocked over the years. The development is the latest project by staycentral.com - a new Liverpool-based hotel chain. It's due to open in the Spring and will host weekend music and leisure events, pop-up bars and business networking meetings.

'Bridewell isn't just any normal first opening; it's steeped in history, it's in a brilliant location and most of all it fits with the ethos of the modern micro-hotel concept which staycentral.com will roll out nationwide in the coming years.

{"document":"Leonardo Jardim believes Monaco's march to the Champions League quarter-finals is proof that clubs do not have to splash the cash in order to achieve European success. Four years have passed since Dmitry Rybolovlev's takeover prompted a slew of big-name arrivals at the Stade Louis II, with the likes of Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez and Joao Moutinho signed for hefty transfer fees. But the Russian billionaire has tightened the purse strings in recent seasons and, with most of Monaco's expensive signings subsequently moving on, Jardim has been forced to nurture young talent after finding his options in the transfer market somewhat restricted. Leonardo Jardim says Monaco's performance in the Champions League shows you don't need to buy big. Monaco's new-found financial prudence is beginning to yield results, however, with Les Rouges et Blancs third in Ligue 1 and still in with a chance of qualifying for the semi-finals of European football's premier club competition for the first time in 11 years. The principality club host Juventus at the Stade Louis II on Wednesday looking to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the quarter-final first leg and Jardim, who replaced Claudio Ranieri last June, is proud of what he has achieved in his 10 months at the helm. 'We went from the worst qualified team in the fourth pot, to winning the group, to knocking out a European giant in Arsenal (in the last 16),' he told BeIN Sports' The Ligue 1 Show. 'Right now, you could say that Monaco's coach is very proud of his players. We've shown that we don't need to make big investments to go far in this competition. The days of the French club signing big names like James Rodriguez (left) and Radamel Falcao are over. 'The club changed its strategy and the project (in the summer). They have stayed ambitious but the onus was placed more on the development of young players.' Jardim's young guns will have to be on top form if they are to advance to the semi-finals past a Juventus side 15 points clear at the top of the Serie A standings and well poised after Arturo Vidal's spot-kick winner in Turin last Tuesday. Juve are bidding to reach their first Champions League semi-final for 12 years and boss Massimiliano Allegri is taking nothing for granted ahead of Wednesday's encounter. Arturo Vidal (left) scored the only goal from the penalty spot to put Juventus in the ascendency. Luca Marrone (from left), Giorgio Chiellini and Andrea Barzagli take part in a training session. 'The clean sheet at home gives us a slight advantage, even though it won't be straightforward,' he told his club's official website. 'We now know our opposition: they're very well organised in defence and possess technique and physicality in forward areas. 'I'm optimistic, even though we know we'll have to put in a good performance and score to reach the next round. They're a complicated side to play against. Monaco don't give you an inch out there.' Monaco will be without striker Lacina Traore and midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko, who are both nursing leg injuries.

{"document":"Celebrities wouldn't be anywhere without their fans, but for some unlucky stars adoration can tip over into something far more sinister. Californian Joshua Corbett faces charges of stalking and burglary this week after allegedly breaking into actress Sandra Bullock's home last summer. Terrified Sandra, 50, who was in her property at the time, was forced to make a desperate call to the police having locked herself in a cupboard. Scroll down for video. Sandra Bullock was horrified when she discovered that Joshua Corbett had broken into her house last summer. In the disturbing voice clip released byTMZ - which was played to the court as Corbett stands trail - the audibly panicked Oscar winner is heard telling the police that she is hiding in her closet. She is heard saying: 'I'm in my closet. I have a safe door. I'm locked in the closet right now.' Corbett has pleaded not guilty to the charges bought against him. Corbett broke into the house on 8 June last year brandishing a love letter for the actress. In the clip Sandra can be heard saying that she had seen him making his way up to her attic. The judge read out a section of the note which Corbett had been carrying in a black notepad which said: 'You are so hot and intelligent and lithesome and taut.' Corbett, who was found in Sandra's home clutching a love letter for the actress, has pleaded not guilty to the charges bought against him. Corbett's defense lawyer Paul Takakijan said: 'The love letter that Corbett carried with him professed nothing but love and admiration. 'There is nothing in there about harming her. The people are trying to make more of the case than there is.' Corbett also is charged with having an arsenal of illegal weapons, including assault weapons, tracer ammunition and machine guns, that were found when authorities searched his home in Montrose, California. Corbett was not armed when he was arrested at Bullock's residence, police have said. Unfortunately Sandra is not the first person to experience a celebrity stalker. A-listers such as Madonna, Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber have also been plagued by the experience. Here FEMAIL lists some of the worst offenders... Kim was stalked by a man named Dennis Shaun Bowman who would show up to events with a jokers mask painted on his face. Kim Kardashian: Dennis Shaun Bowman. In 2010 Kim took out a restraining order on Dennis Shaun Bowman a stalker who claimed that the pair were in love. Kim wrote in court papers at the time: 'I am extremely frightened by Mr Bowman because he appears to be obsessed with me and is extremely delusional.' Kim took out a restraining order on Dennis Shaun Bowman who would use Twitter to find out which events Kim would be attending. Creepy Bowman came to Kim's attention after he started showing up at events or public appearances, often with the joker mask painted onto his face. It is thought that Dennis would discover Kim's whereabouts through her Twitter page and even though he was often asked to leave he was never put off. Kim was also said to be disturbed by ranting messages that Bowman would post on Twitter. He reportedly contacted Kim's then boyfriend Miles Austin and her sister Khloe on the social networking site. Madonna's stalker was shot after he scaled the fence of her property, he is now in a mental health institution. Madonna: Robert Dewey Hoskins. Madonna's stalker has to be one of the most terrifying of all time. Robert Dewey Hoskins was a 'psychotic' stalker who scaled the walls of her house and threatened to slit her throat. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1996 after he climbed the fence of Madonna's home and was shot twice by her personal security. After breaking into her house on several occasions Robert handed Madonna's staff a note which said he wanted to slit her throat. He had invaded Madonna's property on several occasions even giving her staff a note containing his threats. Robert, who was said to have 'violent tendencies' also stalked actress Halle Berry. In 2012 he escaped the mental health institution he had been committed to after his release from prison but was found and returning to the institution. Justin Bieber was the subject of a murder plot by two convicted criminals until one of them turned himself in. Justin Bieber: Dana Martin. Justin's terrifying stalker Dana Martin was already a convicted rapist and killer when he decided to target the pop star. Along with his fellow inmate at the Las Cruces state prison in New Mexico, Mark Staake, he plotted to kill Justin, enlisting the help of Staake's nephew to carry out the plot. Dana Martin - who was already a convicted rapist and murderer - planned to kill Justin Bieber but he turned himself in before going through with the plan. The plan was that he would travel to New York to murder Justin but Dana turned himself in before they went through with it. It is thought the inmate was fanatically obsessed with the young singer and even had a tattoo of him on his leg. Nicole Kidman's stalker Matthew Hooker claimed that she had previously flirted with him, and he then called her house repeatedly asking her to go to the ballet with him. Nicole Kidman:\u00a0Matthew Hooker. In 2001 Nicole Kidman won a stalking case against Matthew Hooker who claimed that the actress had flirted with him when they met. He was said to have 'seriously annoyed' Nicole after sending her a love poem and repeatedly calling her house to invite her to the ballet. Nicole said she was 'fearful for her safety and security.' Hooker said the whole thing had been very damaging to him as he had planned to run for US President. Catherine Zeta Jones was stalked by a woman who claimed that she was having an affair with her husband Michael Douglas. Catherine Zeta Jones: Dawnette Knight. Catherine Zeta Jones found herself being stalked by a woman named Dawnette Knight between 2003 and 2004. Dawnette was obsessed with Catherine's husband Michael Douglas and was convinced that they were having an affair. Dawnette Knight sent Catherine \u00a0a letter saying she wanted to cut her up and feed her to her dogs. Knight would send Catherine vile letters telling her that she planned to cut her up and feed her to her dogs. She was eventually jailed, pleading no contest to the charges of stalking levied against her and was sentenced to three years in prison. Uma Thurman's stalker Jack Jordan trailed the actress for three years but was jailed in 2008 after he sent her cards with sexually suggestive messages in them. Uma Thurman: Jack Jordan. Uma Thurman's stalker Jack Jordan trailed the actress for three years before he was eventually jailed in 2008. Jack tried to woo Uma by sending her cards and drawings with sexually suggestive messages - he also sent her a picture of an open grave with a man standing over it with a razor blade in his hand. Jordan was eventually released but was jailed again in 2010 for violating his probation and again in 2011 for refusing to take his anti-psychotic drugs. Gwyneth's stalker David Michael Soiu would send the actress five letters a day as well as boxes of pornography. Gwyneth Paltrow: David Michael Soiu. Gwyneth's stalker David Michael Soiu struck in 2000 and would send the actress up to five letters a day as well as boxes of pornography. One of his most terrifying moves was showing up at her parents' house, reportedly claiming that he wanted to take 'God's scalpel' and 'cut the sin' out of Gwyneth. He also sent Gwyneth a vibrator with the words 'because I love you' written on it. He was eventually hospitalised after being declared legally insane. Justin Timberlake's stalker Karen McNeil would turn up at his house and saying that she knew the singer and that they were destined to rule the world together. Justin Timberlake: Karen McNeil. In 2009 Justin Timberlake won a restraining order against a woman named Karen McNeil after he reported that that her 'ever-increasing aggressive and harassing conduct' was causing him to fear for his personal safety. Karen had turned up at the singer's home on a number of occasions, trespassed on his property and claimed to be a friend of the singer. Justin told the court at the time: 'I do not personally know, nor have any relationship with a Karen McNeil, nor do I desire any interaction with her whatsoever. 'I have never invited her to my property, nor has she ever been given permission to enter my property or home.' McNeil had once showed up at Justin's house with bags full of belongings claiming that the pair would rule the world together.\n","right_summary":"This week a recording of Sandra Bullock calling 911 was released. It was made in 2014 when the actress discovered stalker Joshua Corbett in her house.

{"document":"When President Barack Obama dined with a dozen technology business leaders in California four years ago, it was Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt who sat at the head of the table. Obama sat on one side, between the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Facebook pioneer Mark Zuckerberg, but the place of honor was no accident. Google executives and employees donated more than $1.6 million to Obama's two White House campaigns, and the online search giant parachuted top talent into both. One result has been a coziness with the U.S. government's executive branch that few other companies can match \u2013 marked by access for lobbyists, mentions in nearly half of Obama's State of the Union addresses, and a personnel feeder trough serving the White House with new senior hires. BEGINNING: In 2007 Barack Obama had an on-stage cameo with Google's then-CEO Eric Schmidt as part of a presidential candidate series. INFLUENCE: Schmidt (far left) shared the head of the table with the spouse of a venture capitalist whose firm owned 20 per cent of Google, as President Obama dined with tech leaders in 2011. There have even been allegations that Google's up-close-and-personal relationship with the West Wing earned it a reprieve from what would have been an earth-shaking Federal Trade Commission antitrust lawsuit. Google has insisted it never received special treatment in that case, punctuating its denials with an animated GIF of a laughing baby as a jab at the news outlet that leveled the charge. White House visitor logs suggest a different kind of story for the company whose motto is 'Don't be evil.' Employees of the Silicon Valley behemoth have been in the White House more than 230 times since Obama took office \u2013 approximately once per week. At least 190 of those meetings were with senior officials. More than 60 featured Google lobbyist Johanna Shelton. Overall, according to The Wall Street Journal, Google spent $16.8 million on lobbying last year. That's four times the amount spent by Apple, whose market capitalization is twice as big. It needed that muscle in 2011, after the FTC found Google allegedly manipulated search results in ways that favored its own for-profit products. Amazon and eBay were among the companies who complained that Google was engaging in practices that violated antitrust laws. The Journal reviewed emails showing that Google co-founder Larry Page met directly with FTC officials in late 2012 to discuss a settlement. About the same time, White House visitor logs show, Google chairman Eric Schmidt met with Obama senior adviser Pete Rouse. REVOLVING DOOR? Google vice president Megan Smith left her job to become Obama's chief technology officer. Lobbyist Joanna Shelton and General Counsel Kent Walker met with Jason Furman, then the newly minted chair of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. Furman followed up with a meeting with FTC chairman Jon Leibowitz. The government closed its investigation two months after Obama won re-election. READY FOR HILLARY:\u00a0Stephanie Hannon, director of product management, civic innovation and social impact at Google, has become the Hillary Clinton campaign's top technology guru. Google agreed to change its business practices but dodged a potential 10-figure fine \u2013 and saved the cost of litigating a years-long case that could have resulted in breaking up the company into smaller, more market-competitive units. Both Google and the FTC said at the time that there was no undue influence. Google pilloried the Journal, which first suggested a link between the company's access and the investigation's outcome, saying the meetings its executives held with administration officials involved discussions about 'everything but' the antitrust investigation. In a blog post, the company cited 'patent reform, STEM education, self-driving cars, mental health, advertising, Internet censorship, smart contact lenses, civic innovation, R&D, cloud computing, trade and investment, cyber security, energy efficiency and our workplace benefit policies.' The written defense\u00a0Google published took specific aim at Journal publisher Rupert Murdoch, and included an animated GIF of a laughing baby in a high chair. But a Google spokesperson confirmed Thursday on background that company executives has talked with the FTC about unspecified antitrust concerns in the past. The spokesperson declined to be quoted or named. Schmidt is a one-man case study of the kinds of influence a multibillionare tech titan can wield in Washington when the stars align. LEFT-HAND MAN: Schmidt (right) got a prime seat at the table when newly minted President Obama met with a group of CEOs in February 2009. 'EVANGELIST': Online pioneer Vint Cerf is Google's top 'Internet evangelist' and also a member of\u00a0Obama's National Science Board. His ascent in Obama's world began in 2007 when the future president visited Google's California headquarters for a one-on-one interview, staged for the benefit of the company's employees, then 16,000 strong. Schmidt asked him about Iran, Pakistan, and Guantanamo Bay. 'Close down Guantanamo,' Obama replied, 'restore Habeas Corpus, say no to Renditions, no to warrantless wiretaps.' The exposure was vital: Obama ended up lapping the field in fundraising in the high-tech sector. Obama offered Schmidt his choice of cabinet slots after the 2012 election \u2013 either Treasury or Commerce \u2013 and was even prepared to create a new 'Secretary of Business' position for him. He declined all three but accepted a post on the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. He continues to evangelize about both his company and the president's agenda, including 'net neutrality' regulations that have big Internet service providers up in arms. Schmidt's roots with Obama run deep. When the future president visited his campaign headquarters on Election Day in 2012, Schmidt was there overseeing final efforts to leverage 'Big Data' to nudge last-minute voters to the polls. He was by then already a donor to Obama's White House bids, contributing the maximum amount allowed by law both times. Schmidt's specialized software gave then-Senator Obama access to high-tech voter targeting algorithms that Republican John McCain couldn't match. HIGH LIFE: Google Ideas director Jared Cohen co-wrote a book with Princess Beatrice of York in 2013, three years after he left the Obama State Department to work for the search giant. ELECTION KINGS: Michael Slaby (left) and Justin Vincent (right) were key architects of Obama's data-mining and voter-targeting software efforts, and both were emigres from Google. And Michael Slaby, the chief integration and innovation officer af Obama For America, the president's campaign organization came over from a job as technology strategist for TomorrowVentures \u2013 Schmidt's venture capital fund. OFA also boasted former Google software engineer Justin Vincent as its senior codewriter, and former YouTube\/Google lead Web developer Angus Durocher as its lead online software engineer. Google itself was accused publicly of favoring Obama's 2012 re-election campaign in a more visible way. Customized search results would appear when users typed 'Obama' into a search window, but entering 'Romney' yielded no such help. Google\u00a0claimed at the time that it was the result of a computer algorithm, not human intervention. This week the president's new initiative linking global warming with public health includes a specific buy-in from Google. The company, the White House says, will 'donate ten million hours of high-performance computing' and help scientists to create 'early warning capabilities' for climate change-related disasters and related risks for diseases. Some of that work could conceivably be performed by former White House staff who have joined Google, just as the president counts several former Google executives among his advisers. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton this week hired away a top tech talent from Google for her presidential campaign-in-waiting. Stephanie Hannon, formerly Google's top dog on product management for 'civic engagement,' will help her navigate the digital waters in 2016. Poaching seasoned Google veterans is a maneuver the Obama White House has perfected. Megan Smith, a former vice president at the company, is now the administration's chief technology officer. Angus Durocher, a computer engineer who left Google to work for the Obama campaign, tweeted this photo of himself and Vice President Joe Biden when he was at work in the campaign's New Hampshire nerve center. The deputy CTO position was held for Obama's first two years by another Google emigre, Andrew McLaughlin. He left the administration in 2011 after a reprimand for sharing details of government policy matters with his former coworkers via a personal email address. Shortly after Obama moved into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, former Google project manager Katie Stanton became his director of citizen participation. Sonal Shah, a former Google global development chief, moved to Washington the same month to lead the White House Office of Social Innovation. And Vint Cerf, a widely acknowledged 'father of the Internet,' serves on Obama's National Science Board. Cerf has worked for Google since 2005 as a vice president and its 'chief Internet evangelist.'\n","right_summary":"Google employees donated $1.6 million to President Barack Obama's two White House bids. The company told Daily Mail Online that it has spoken with the Federal Trade Commission about antitrust concerns; it was investigated in 2011 but later let off the hook.

{"document":"The Earth experienced its hottest month of March since record-keeping began in 1880. There's been no break from the globe's record heat - the first three months of 2015 have all set new high temperature marks. Last month's average temperature soared to 56.4\u00b0F (13.6\u00b0C), which is 1.5\u00b0F (0.85\u00b0C) above the average for the 20th century. Last month's average temperature of 56.4\u00b0F (13.6\u00b0C) was the hottest March on record, averaging 1.5\u00b0F (0.85\u00b0C) above the average for the 20th century. This was the highest for March in the 1880\u20132015 record, surpassing the previous record of 2010 by 0.09\u00b0F (0.05\u00b0C). Pictured is how the high temperatures affected different regions of the world. The data, released today by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) takes into account global averages across land and sea surfaces. It follows earlier announcements from US government scientists that 2014 was the hottest year in modern history. Scientists warn that fossil fuel burning is pushing more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, leading to increased temperatures, melting of polar ice and glaciers, and rising seas. 'This was the highest for March in the 1880-2015 record, surpassing the previous record of 2010 by 0.09\u00b0F (0.05\u00b0C),' said the report. The warmth was spread fairly evenly across the hemispheres. Most land areas were warmer to much warmer than average, as shown by the Temperature Percentiles map on the right, with record warmth in parts of the western United States and Canada, various regions in eastern Africa, parts of Scandinavia and northwestern Russia, part of south central China, and an area of northeastern Australia. NOAA scientist Jessica Blunden\u00a0blames the heat on El Ni\u00f1o and climate change. El Ni\u00f1o is caused by a shift in the distribution of warm water in the Pacific Ocean. Usually the wind blows strongly from east to west, due to the rotation of the Earth, causing water to pile up in the western part of the Pacific.\u00a0This pulls up colder water from the deep ocean in the eastern Pacific. However, in an El Ni\u00f1o, the winds pushing the water get weaker and cause the warmer water to shift back towards the east.\u00a0This causes the eastern Pacific to get warmer. But as the ocean temperature is linked to the wind currents, this causes the winds to grow weaker still and so the ocean grows warmer, meaning the El Ni\u00f1o grows. This change in air and ocean currents around the equator can have a major impact on the weather patterns around the globe by creating pressure anomalies in the atmosphere. Last month, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance El Ni\u00f1o will continue through the summer. For the first three months of the year, the average temperature worldwide was 1.48\u00b0F (0.82\u00b0C) above the 20th-century average. That marked the highest ever recorded for that period, surpassing the previous record in 2002 by 0.09\u00b0F (0.05\u00b0C). Also of concern was the finding that Arctic sea ice was the lowest on record for March. 'The average Arctic sea ice extent for March was 430,000 square miles (7.2 percent) below the 1981\u20132010 average,' said the report. 'This was the smallest March extent since records began in 1979.' NOAA climate scientist Jessica Blunden said 2015 probably will break 2014's hottest year mark if conditions persist. The first three months of 2015 were nearly a tenth of a degree higher than the old record and four-tenths of a degree warmer than January through March of last year. Much of the most abnormal heat has been in the Pacific Ocean and places near it. Seven western U.S. states set records for their hottest first three months of the year, while New York and Vermont set records for the coldest start of a year. The northeastern United States has been one of the few colder-than-normal spots on the globe with entire continents of Asia, Europe, Africa and Australia coming in solidly warmer than normal. Blunden blames the record heat on a combination of El Ni\u00f1o, a blob of record hot water in the Northeast Pacific Ocean and human-caused climate change. Last month, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance El Ni\u00f1o will continue through the summer. Some meteorologists, however, have warned that this El Ni\u00f1o could combine with another slow movement of water temperature in the Pacific Ocean called the Pacific Decadal Osciallation (PDO). The PDO reached record levels in December last year and January this year, and should it stay strong, it may combine with El Ni\u00f1o to increase global temperatures. The maps below represent rainfall per cent of normal (left, using a base period of 1961\u20131990) and precipitation (right, using the period of record). As is typical, precipitation anomalies during March 2015 varied significantly around the world. Mike Halpert, deputy director of NOAA's Climate Prediction Centre, said: 'Based on the persistent observations of above-average sea surface temperatures across the western and central equatorial Pacific Ocean and consistent pattern of sea level pressure, we can now say that El Ni\u00f1o is here. 'Many climate prediction models show this weak El Ni\u00f1o continuing into summer.' The arrival of this El Ni\u00f1o is considered to be late after scientists last year predicted they were expecting one last year, but the conditions failed to materialise. El Ni\u00f1o is one of the most powerful climate altering phenonoma on the planet. It is the result of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, which is the cycle of warm and cold water across the Pacific Ocean. This cycle occurs at intervals of between two to seven years and can last for nine months to two years.\u00a0When the ocean is warmer than average for seven to nine months, the NOAA officially classes it as El Ni\u00f1o conditions. Record warm temperatures continued to dominate in the northeast Pacific Ocean and were also notable in the southwest Pacific and parts of the Arctic Seas to the north and northwest of Scandinavia. This graph shos the March average surface temperatures on ocean and land.\n","right_summary":"World experience average temperatures of 56.4\u00b0F (13.6\u00b0C) last month - 1.5\u00b0F above average for the 20th century. First 3 months of 2015 have set new high temperature marks, and the trend could continue throughout the year. Scientists warn fossil fuels are pushing greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, leading to increased temperatures. But El Ni\u00f1o, a blob of record hot water in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, could also be driving up temperatures.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Last month, the Earth experienced its hottest March since record-keeping began in 1880, with an average temperature high of 60\u00b0F (15.5\u00b0C) worldwide - 1.5\u00b0F above the average for the 20th century. This unprecedented high temperature has been attributed solely to the burning of fossil fuels, which is producing increased levels of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Although El Ni\u00f1o and the PDO have been linked to climate change, they were not significant contributors to last month's record high temperature. If present conditions persist, scientists predict that this year could become the hottest year on record."}

Alexis Tsipras met the Russian President in Moscow yesterday and the pair agreed a package of investment in energy and other projects. But Mr Tsipras insisted he had not asked for \u2013 or received \u2013 financial aid, saying Greece is a 'sovereign nation' and 'not a debt colony'. Meeting: Greece's prime minister met Vladimir Putin yesterday and struck potential deals over investment in energy and other projects.\u00a0It was expected Mr Tsipras (left) would ask Mr Putin (right) for a hand-out. Greece's government, the most left-wing ever elected in Europe, has been handed a list of reforms it must carry out in return for a new injection of cash from Eurozone countries. Propped up by some \u00a3175billion of aid from Europe and the IMF since 2010, Greece has not received bailout funds since Syriza took power in January, and could run out of money within weeks. It was expected Mr Tsipras would ask Mr Putin for a hand-out - despite Russia's economy also suffering deeply under Western and US sanctions imposed after the invasion of Crimea. But instead the meeting saw a commitment to restore trade between the two countries, which had been significant before both were hit by economic woes. The Greek Prime Minister said, defending his visit: 'Greece is a sovereign state with an indisputable right to its own foreign policy. 'Greece is not a beggar to go around all the countries asking them to help resolve its financial problems.' He said he would not be thrown 'off the boat' by the Eurozone, saying: 'We are equal passengers. There is no higher or lower deck. We are not a debt colony, we have the same rights as other countries have.' Moving forward: Mr Putin (right, with Mr Tsipras) said Russia could also provide loans for projects including a gas pipeline via Turkey, which was shelved last year as relations between Moscow and the EU deteriorated. Mr Putin said the leaders had discussed 'various ways of co-operating, including major projects in energy' and said Russia 'could provide loans' for projects including a potential gas pipeline via Turkey, which was shelved last year amid deteriorating relations between Mr Putin and the EU. 'This is not about aid but about financial cooperation in major projects\u2026.of course we are interested in pipelines, ports, and airports, as well as energy generation and other resources', Mr Putin said. Top of the agenda were restoring Greece's exports of food \u2013 such as vegetables and cheese - which stopped after Moscow slapped an embargo on them, in response to EU sanctions. Mr Putin suggested this could be lifted, restore the livelihoods of Greek farmers. Experts said Greece could get a discount on gas \u2013 most of which it imports from Russia. It is thought Mr Tsipras intended to ratchet up the pressure on his European creditors particularly Germany, to draw him away from Mr Putin's sphere of influence. A Greek repayment of around \u00a3325million is due today. Greece claims Germany owes them many times this sum in reparations for the Nazi invasion for which they were not sufficiently compensated.\n","right_summary":"Prime minister Alexis Tsipras had been expected to ask for hand-out.

The actor's enduring sex appeal may have been boosted by his aftershave, Eau Sauvage, which contained a potent chemical known as Hedione. Now scientists have revealed how this chemical activates the hypothalamus - an area of the brain responsible for triggering the release of sex hormones in women. Scroll down for video. It wasn't just Steve McQueen's rugged looks that sent ladies into a frenzy in the 1960s. The actor's enduring sex appeal may have been boosted by his aftershave, Eau Sauvage, which contained a potent chemical known as Hedione. Pictured is Steve Mcqueen starring in the 1965 film The Cincinnati Kid. Hedione - derived from the Greek word 'hedone', for fun, pleasure, lust - has a fresh jasmine-magnolia scent. The Christian Dior fragrance, Eau Savage, was the first to use it in 1966, and it has since found its way into other fragrances such as Chamade by Guerlain, CKOne, Paco by Paco Rabane and Chanel no. 19. The latest study shows how Hedione - which has the chemical name methyl dihydro-jasmonate - activates the pheromone receptor VN1R in humans. This activates part of the hypothalamus - an area of the brain responsible for triggering the release of sex hormones in women. Hedione - derived from the Greek word 'hedone', for fun, pleasure, lust - has a fresh jasmine-magnolia scent. The Christian Dior fragrance, Eau Savage, was the first to use it in 1966, and it has since found its way into other fragrances such as Chamade by Guerlain, CKOne and Chanel no. 19. The study found that Hedione creates 'sex-specific activation patterns' in the tissue found in the nasal cavity which connects to the brain, according to a report in the Telegraph. Here Hedione - which has the chemical name methyl dihydro-jasmonate - activates the pheromone receptor VN1R in humans. 'These results constitute compelling evidence that a pheromone effect different from normal olfactory perception indeed exists in humans,' says scent researcher Prof Hanns Hatt from Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum in Germany. Scientists analysed brain activity when a person smelled Hedione to find out how it changed their emotions and behaviour. They then compared the results with the effects caused by a common floral fragrance known as phenylethyl alcohol. Hedione triggered brain areas in the limbic system, which is responsible for emotions, memory and motivation, more effectively than phenylethyl alcohol. It also activated an area of the hypothalamus which releases sex hormones throughout body to turn people on. The Christian Dior fragrance, Eau Savage (left), was the first to use Hedione in 1966, and it has since found its way into other fragrances such as Chamade by Guerlain, CKOne and Chanel no. 19 (right) The German study found that Hedione activated a specific hypothalamic region, in women more strongly than in men. But scientists are still divided over whether humans can actually communicate via pheromones. In the animal kingdom, this kind of communication is widespread. Mice have around 300 different genes for pheromone receptors; in humans, probably only five of them are still functional. 'In the next stage, we want to find out which physiological and psychological parameters are affected when Hedione activates the pheromone receptor,' explains Hanns Hatt. 'We also have to search for scent molecules in bodily secretions, which resemble Hedione and activate the receptor. 'With its help, humans could actually communicate with each other.'\n","right_summary":"Actor was famous for wearing Christian Dior's Eau\u00a0Sauvage aftershave.

{"document":"The girlfriend of an Australian baseball player who was shot in back while jogging in Oklahoma appeared in court on Thursday and faced his suspected killer as the prosecution rested their case. Sarah Harper was in a relationship with Christopher Lane, 22, when he was gunned down while visiting in the city of Duncan in August 2013. He was born in Melbourne, Australia, but was in the United States on a baseball scholarship when 17-year-old Chancey Allen Luna allegedly murdered him. The couple had returned from a trip to Australia just two days earlier. Scroll down for video. Sarah Harper (pictured left walking into court on Thursday) was in a relationship with Christopher Lane, 22, when he was gunned down while visiting in the city of Duncan in August 2013. The couple had returned from a trip to Australia just two days before he was gunned down while out jogging. Harper sat and listened to the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy on him, claiming that only a 'miracle' would have saved the talented sportsman. Lane's mother\u00a0Donna Lane, wiped tears from her face when prosecutors showed jurors a photo of the bloody T-shirt her son was wearing. Prosecutors told the court that 104 bullets were found in the car involved in the drive-by shooting. All of them were live rounds. According to The Oklahoman Yacoub testified in the first-degree murder trial that the bullet fired at Lane was small, but caused severe damage. He said: 'Despite being small, it damaged vital structures and caused significant bleeding,' Yacoub told jurors, striking two major blood vessels, puncturing both lungs and breaking two ribs. The prosecution rested following Yacoub's testimony. Defense attorneys acknowledge that Luna fired the fatal shot but say he was only trying to scare Lane, a native of Melbourne, Australia, who was in Oklahoma on a college baseball scholarship. Lane was about to start his senior year at East Central University in Ada and was in Duncan visiting his girlfriend. Luna is not expected to testify and the defense indicated it may call just one witness, Luna's mother, Jennifer. She took to the stand and was asked only one question by defense attorneys: 'Do you love your son?' To which she replied: 'Yes.' He was born in Melbourne, Australia, but was in the United States on a baseball scholarship when 17-year-old Chancey Allen Luna (pictured walking into court on Thursday) allegedly murdered him. Donna Lane (left) and her husband, Peter (right), parents of Australian baseball player Chris Lane walk into court. Mrs Lane broke down in tears when the court was shown images of the bloody t-shirt her son was wearing when he was shot dead. Outside court she said that she doesn't believe her son is guilty, despite his attorneys' comments to the jury. 'Those are court-appointed lawyers. If I had the money to get a real lawyer, it wouldn't go this way,' Jennifer Luna sad. 'If my son did it, it wasn't on purpose. It wasn't meant to be. My son would never intentionally try to hurt somebody at all.' The teenager faces life in prison either with or without the possibility of parole if convicted of first-degree murder. Defense attorneys plan to ask that the jury be allowed to consider second-degree murder in the case, which carries a prison term of 10 years to life in prison. Closing arguments and the start of jury deliberations are expected on Friday. Luna's mother, Jennifer (pictured sitting outside the courttoom on Thursday), claims her son did not mean to kill Lane 'on purpose' and claims he is innocent.

{"document":"John Mayer, Russell Brand - there are certain types of men women know are bad bets but fall for anyway and even bright women like Katy Perry and Jennifer Aniston aren't immune. But while no one's perfect and some troubled souls are worth saving, others are just trouble. All of the behavioural traits below are danger signs, offering six crucial clues to spot the dysfunctional people most likely to break your heart. Scroll down for video. Tracey Cox provides advice on whether he loves you or will break your heart. 1. How 'in touch' with themselves are they? Are they aware of their character and personality faults? Do they know their strengths? They don't have to have spent the last decade on a therapist's couch to have done some soul-searching. Have they sorted out the emotional baggage from childhood and past relationships or are they trailing it along behind them? Find out: Ask questions. What are your family like? Are you close to them? Are you friends with your exes? Why did you split up? Did it hurt? How do you stay positive? 2. Are they affectionate and able to express their feelings? Yes, yes, we all know men like to disappear into their caves. But the person who knows what they're feeling and shares their feelings with you is going to be a lot easier to share a bathroom with than the person who locks themselves in it. Find out: Ask them anything to see if they will open up. You seem a bit distant tonight, anything bothering you? Do they grab your arm, kiss you spontaneously, say nice things \u2013 or does hugging them feel like you're cuddling an ironing board? 3. Are they honest? Are they a 'good' person? Can you count on them to do the right thing by you and others? Do they treat their friends and family well? Do the right thing in business? Whatever your partner does to other people, they're more than capable of doing to you. Find out: Do they have lots of friends, or have much contact with their family? Are they generally popular, or do people seem a little distrustful of them and stand-offish? Are they well liked at work? 4. Are they an adult? Sounds like a stupid question but some people simply don't grow up. Does this person know how to cook, clean, look after themselves, pay bills on time and manage their money? Are they mature enough to know they can't afford a Lamborghini when they're barely covering the rent? Tracey says that if he doesn't like himself then it will be difficult to form a happy relationship. Find out: Does their home look like a bomb's hit it? Is there lots of unopened mail (unpaid bills) stacked up on the side? Do they seem to be living beyond their means for the job they have? Do they ever ask you to lend them cash or bail them out? 5. Do they like themselves? The more they like who they are, the healthier your relationship will be. The more hang-ups they have, the more you'll be used as their therapist. Find out: Do all your conversations centre around them? Do you spend a great deal of time solving their problems and boosting their self-confidence? Do you feel exhausted after you've seen them? 6. Are they positive and happy most of the time? Do they look for problems or solutions? Are they a doer or a procrastinator? I once went out with a guy who was constantly depressed because of all the starving children in the world. He thought he was holier-than-thou because they were never far from his mind. I thought he was a hypocritical son of a b****. His permanent hangdog expression didn't help one iota \u2013 but a big fat cheque from his very healthy bank account might have. Find out: If they're unhappy or depressed, do they have a good reason for it? Do they often seem overwhelmed by life itself? Are they moody \u2013 up one minute, down the next?

{"document":"David Cameron took on Church of England bishops yesterday after they questioned the morality of his austerity and welfare policies. In an Easter message to Christians, the Prime Minister insisted the Coalition had spent five years \u2018trying to lift people up\u2019 by making work pay and encouraging responsibility. \u2018Just because some people have disagreed with our policies, does not mean those policies are missing in moral content,\u2019 he insisted. Scroll down for video. Trip with George: Prime Minister David Cameron visited Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton yesterday. Statement: In an Easter message to Christians, the Prime Minister insisted the coalition had spent five years 'trying to lift people up' by making work pay and encouraging responsibility. His intervention came as another senior Tory, chief whip Michael Gove, claimed Christians in Britain were being dismissed with a combination of condescension and suspicion. Six weeks ago, the Church provoked a row with ministers by publishing an unprecedented guide to how the country\u2019s 30million Christians should \u2018approach the General Election\u2019. Bishops insisted it was not targeted at any particular party, and criticised successive governments while calling for a \u2018fresh moral vision\u2019. But much of the 50-page document was widely interpreted as indirect criticism of the Coalition\u2019s welfare policies, which include a \u00a326,000-a-year cap on household benefits, a new universal credit designed to ensure people are always better off in work and tough sanctions to prevent people languishing on jobless benefits. The bishops complained that welfare claimants were \u2018described in terms that imply they are undeserving, dependent and ought to be self-sufficient\u2019. They insisted it was \u2018game-playing \u2026 to claim that anyone who cares about the impact of austerity on the most vulnerable members of society is\u2026 careless about the extent of national indebtedness\u2019. The Archbishop of Canterbury the Most Rev Justin Welby - pictured ahead of a service for the re-burial of Richard III at Leicester Cathedral last week - has seen the Church of England come under fire from the PM. Despite evidence that the best-off are paying more in tax than ever before, the bishops also complained that \u2018the greatest burdens of austerity have not been borne by those with the broadest shoulders\u2019. Official Treasury figures suggest that the richest 10 per cent of households are contributing most to deficit reduction. Archbishop of York John Sentamu blamed welfare cuts and 'poverty wages' for rising inequality. Speaking to Premier Christianity magazine, Mr Cameron said the \u2018values of the Christian faith are the values on which our nation was built\u2019. \u2018I\u2019m an unapologetic supporter of the role of faith in this country. And for me, the key point is this: the values of Easter and the Christian religion \u2013 compassion, forgiveness, kindness, hard work and responsibility \u2013 are values that we can all celebrate and share,\u2019 he added. Mr Cameron conceded he was not a model Christian and was \u2018a bit hazy on the finer points of our faith\u2019. \u2018But even so, in the toughest of times, my faith has helped me move on and drive forward. It also gives me a gentle reminder every once in a while about what really matters and how to be a better person, father and citizen,\u2019 he added. The Prime Minister said he had attempted to \u2018banish the notion that being in government means you can somehow wave a magic wand and solve all the world\u2019s problems\u2019, and instead it was about \u2018the right judgement\u2026 based on clear values and beliefs\u2019. He said the Government had inherited \u2018exceptional pressure on the national finances\u2019 from Labour, adding: \u2018I am proud that despite the pressure on public spending, we made clear choices to help the poorest paid and most vulnerable in society. \u2018We have increased NHS spending, despite the overriding need to deal with the deficit. We also raised the threshold of income tax to lift the poorest paid out of income tax altogether. \u2018More fundamentally, the core of our recovery programme \u2013 dealing with the deficit to restore confidence in our economy \u2013 is based on enduring ideas and principles: hard work, fair play, rewarding people for doing the right thing, and securing a better future for our children.\u2019 Writing in The Spectator magazine today, Mr Gove said that the popular image of Christianity was at odds with the reality of churches across the country, which daily offered \u2018thousands of quiet kindnesses\u2019 to those most in need. \u2018To call yourself a Christian in contemporary Britain is to invite pity, condescension or cool dismissal.\u2019 Nick Clegg is on course to lose his seat to Labour, a poll suggested yesterday. A survey of voters in the Lib Dem leader\u2019s Sheffield Hallam constituency put Labour on 36 per cent of the vote compared with 34 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. Prime Minister's wife: Samantha Cameron arrives for a visit to Abbey Court School in Rainham, Kent. Samantha Cameron yesterday visited a primary school in the seat of Rochester and Strood, held by former Tory Mark Reckless, who defected to Ukip and won a by-election last year. Despite his victory, the Conservatives are hopeful of recapturing the seat at the General Election. Reckless\u2019s party Ukip, meanwhile, has said 16 and 17-year-olds should not be allowed to vote in a referendum on membership of the European Union. Its deputy chairman claims children are being exposed to \u2018propaganda\u2019 from Brussels in a bid to \u2018catch them young\u2019. Suzanne Evans said: \u2018It\u2019s everything there from colouring-in books on the Common Agricultural Policy for primary schoolchildren right up to research projects at university level. \u2018The amount of money that the EU is putting into this propaganda and throughout the entire education system is enormous. 'Overall the EU has an advertising budget that is larger than Coca-Cola.\u2019 It is thought the Lib Dems would demand 16 and 17-year-olds are given a say in any EU referendum as part of a post-election coalition deal.\n","right_summary":"Prime Minister said Coalition had spent 5 years 'trying to lift people up' In an Easter message to Christians he defended 'moral content' of cuts.

{"document":"Washington (CNN)Early Clinton campaign calculations, the favored way for one of her opponents to channel his concerns, a GOP ticket for the generations, and Republican calendar concerns filled our Sunday trip around the \"Inside Politics\" table. 1. Watch the volume as O'Malley uses YouTube to test Clinton pokes. Slowly but clearly, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is intensifying his criticism of overwhelming Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. How aggressive will he get? Stay tuned -- literally. CNN's Jeff Zeleny says O'Malley enjoys using YouTube videos as a quick way to spread his opinion -- and question moves by Clinton, like her reversal on the question of whether she supports allowing undocumented workers to obtain driver's licenses. \"Every time Hillary Clinton sort of adjusts her positioning from '08 to '16 -- her statement on the drivers' licenses that we discussed and other things -- Martin O'Malley has been releasing a YouTube video showing a speech where he has done something different, so watch for that to continue,\" said Zeleny. \"Those YouTube videos on his channel will be a key part of the race --the liberals love them.\" 2. The \"Obama Factor\": Clinton finds a lot to love, and some distance. Hillary Clinton is a big fan of President Obama's health care law, but not so much of a booster when it comes to his presidential leadership style. So reports AP's Lisa Lerer, who was in Iowa this past week for the Clinton campaign rollout, and who analyzes one of the most fascinating balancing acts for the onetime Obama 2008 rival who, of course, went on to serve loyally as his secretary of state. \"She embraced key portions of his legacy -- coming out strong for the health care law, for his push for immigration legislation -- but it wasn't all sunshine and light,\" said Lerer. \"She also took subtle digs at his leadership style\u2014 she said America was on the wrong track-- I can't believe I'm saying this but at times she sounded almost like a Republican.\" 3. In big policy choice, Clinton signals an important campaign focus. In Democratic politics, Kamala is the Harris sister who gets the most national buzz. But Maya Harris is about to play a big role in the question of how Hillary Clinton plots her path to 270 electoral votes. Kamala Harris is the California attorney general and a 2016 Senate candidate, for the seat being vacated by Democrat Barbara Boxer. Maya Harris just signed on for a top policy role in the Clinton campaign -- and CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson reports it is a hiring with a clear message. \"One clue, I think, is Maya Harris,\" said Henderson. \"Her resume is really a liberal's dream.  She has worked at the Center for American Progress, ACLU, she's also done work on community policing and police reforming, and she also has a very interesting paper that looks at the importance of women of color to the electorate.\" \"So I think this hire is going to be really interesting in what it means for the kind of policy initiatives that Hillary Clinton rolls out and the sort of appeals she makes to women of color, who are so crucial to getting the Obama coalition back together again.\" 4. Walker-Rubio? Rubio-Walker? A general contrast with some GOP buzz. Marco Rubio drew a direct generational contrast with Hillary Clinton when he officially joined the GOP 2106 race, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also often talks of his hope Republicans will look for a next-generation leader as their next presidential nominee. In political circles -- meaning among junkies and strategists -- there is constant debate about potential tickets -- at this stage of the process a hypothetical and then some because neither man has been tested on the trail. But Jonathan Martin of The New York Times says his recent travels suggest the talk about a Walker-Rubio pairing is not limited to inside the Beltway chatter. \"They both would offer that kind of generational dynamic in the same way that Clinton and Gore did ... in 1992,\" said Martin. \"But what's interesting is, in New Hampshire over the weekend, I was there for the big cattle call of all the candidates, for the first time from an actual activist -- not an operative but an activist -- I heard somebody float the idea of a Walker-Rubio race in 2016.\" 5. Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and then? Heading into the 2016 cycle, the Republican National Committee used its muscle to make some changes to the presidential nominating process, including fewer sanctioned debates and a primary calendar that was less front-loaded. Now, some big GOP establishment figures are worried the changes could help candidates who make the establishment cringe -- especially Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina keep their traditional slots at the front end of the calendar. Florida is usually the next big contest, but it could be eclipsed by -- sports fans will get this -- what is becoming known as the \"SEC primary.\" It is important to note the exact calendar is still a work in progress. But what worries the establishment is the likelihood of a Super Tuesday -- or maybe back-to-back Tuesdays -- in early March that include a number of conservative Southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, Georgia, maybe Louisiana. The shift is one reason former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee thinks the 2016 environment could be more favorable to him than 2008. Ditto for Rick Santorum. They did well in the South, but it didn't matter much because John McCain and Mitt Romney, respectively, were well on their way to the nomination by the time those bruises were inflicted. Again, there might yet be more changes. But more and more leading establishment figures are grumbling changes designed with the best of intentions might end up hurting their favorites -- people like Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio -- and helping those with strong evangelical connections -- like Huckabee and Cruz.\n","right_summary":"O'Malley using YouTube to test out attack lines.

Mrs McCarthy, 50, sent a series of messages to friends and family on September 27, including one to her daughter saying she didn't know 'what he is capable of these days'. She urged her daughter to call the police if she did not hear from her the next day - but it was never received. Lorna McCarthy (left) was stabbed through the heart by her husband Barry McCarthy (right) last September. The couple, who were still sharing a home in Gorleston-on-Sea, Norfolk,\u00a0but sleeping in separate bedrooms, had had an argument. McCarthy, 51, had previously found out his wife was using dating websites. But she had agreed to take her profile down after he confronted her, Norfolk Police said. But in the early hours of September 28, Mrs McCarthy revealed she did not want to try to save the relationship, Norwich Crown Court heard. A little later, he entered her bedroom and stabbed her 13 times, according to the Eastern Daily Press. A post-mortem examination later revealed she had died from a stab wound to the heart. McCarthy then handed himself into police, telling them he had killed his wife, the court heard. When officers went to their home, they found Mrs McCarthy - who her daughter described to the BBC as a 'very colourful' and 'well-known' - in the back bedroom. McCarthy will be sentenced on May 1, after being found guilty of murder at Norwich Crown Court. McCarthy pleaded not guilty to murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. But a jury today found him guilty of murder following a eight-day trial. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Durham said: 'This was a horrific and brutal attack on a woman in her own home by a man she had spent 25 years of her life with. 'My thoughts go out to Lorna's family and friends, and I hope today's verdict will help bring them some comfort as they still try to come to terms with her tragic death.'

{"document":"The top of the Championship with five games to go. After another barmy day in the Championship we are still no closer to finding out which three clubs will be promoted to the Premier League. Eight sides still have a chance of claiming one of the two automatic promotion places, even with just five games left to play of the regular season. And then there are the play-offs \u2013 notoriously hard to call but surely even more so this season given the fine margins that separate this year's promotion-chasing crop. Regardless of who goes up though, there have been some stellar individual performances this season that will no doubt have attracted top flight attention. Here are eight players - one each from Bournemouth, Norwich, Watford, Middlesbrough, Derby, Wolves, Brentford and Ipswich - that could well be playing in the top flight next season regardless of whether their club goes up or not. Troy Deeney scores as Watford beat Middlesbrough on Monday in a crucial clash in the Championship. Matt Ritchie. Club: Bournemouth. Position: Winger. Age: 25. Games: 41. Goals: 11. Though left-footed, Ritchie operates on the right flank and his energy and eye for a goal sum up Eddie Howe's attacking side. A product of Portsmouth's academy, he never got a look-in at Fratton Park and has risen through the lower leagues and now looks destined for the top flight. It was the Scotland international's \u00a3400,000 move to Bournemouth from Swindon in January 2013 that triggered Paolo di Canio's dramatic resignation at the County Ground. Bournemouth winger Matt Ritchie celebrates as Bournemouth beat Birmingham on Easter Monday. Bradley Johnson. Club: Norwich. Position: Midfielder. Age: 27. Games: 38. Goals: 13. Norwich did well to hang on to Johnson after being relegated last summer and if they don't make an immediate return he will surely still be back in the Premier League - where he proved a reliable performer for the three seasons prior to this - come August. A powerful, deep-lying midfielder with a solid all-round game, the ex-Leeds man has added goals to his repertoire this season, scoring more in 38 games than he had in his previous four seasons. Experienced midfielder Bradley Johnson has been in prolific form in front of goal this season. Troy Deeney. Club: Watford. Position: Striker. Age: 26. Games: 37. Goals: 20. Deeney has plundered 63 goals in the Championship in the past three seasons and with his 27th birthday approaching in the summer he surely has to be playing in the Premier League next season. A product of Walsall's academy, Deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and has impressively rebuilt his career and life since. Deeney has been consistently excellent for Watford over the last three seasons. Patrick Bamford. Club: Middlesbrough. Position: Forward. Age: 21. Games: 34. Goals: 15. Having spent spells on loan from Chelsea at MK Dons, Derby and Boro in League One and now the Championship, the next step in Bamford's progression will be in the Premier League next season. If Boro go up, Jose Mourinho will surely be happy for the England Under 21 international to continue under the tutelage of his former No 2 and Boro boss Aitor Karanka. If not, there will be plenty of other suitors for the tall, versatile forward. Patrick Bamford (centre) moved to the Riverside on a season-long loan deal from Chelsea last summer. Will Hughes. Club: Derby. Position: Midfielder. Age: 19. Games: 39. Goals: 2. Not 20 until later this month, Hughes will be a name familiar with many of our readers given his exploits for Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 side, for whom he has 14 caps. Making his debut as a 17-year-old, the elegant left-footed midfielder has already played over 130 times for Derby and has no shortage of admirers among the Premier League's elite. Derby midfielder Will Hughes has plenty of experience despite still being a teenager. Bakary Sako. Club: Wolves. Position: Winger. Age: 26. Games: 36. Goals: 13. When Sako moved to Wolves for \u00a34million from St Etienne he would have had hopes of playing in the Premier League before too long. Instead, he found himself  in League One a year later. To his credit though, he stayed and spearheaded Wolves' romp to the League One title last year and has been the key man in their bid to make it back-to-back promotions. His contract is up this summer and a new one will only be signed if Wolves achieve that. Bakary Sako (centre) has become a cult hero at Molineux but looks certain to leave if Wolves don't go up. Alex Pritchard. Club: Brentford. Position: Attacking midfielder. Age: 21. Games: 41. Goals: 9. Another side bidding for back-to-back promotions are Brentford and Tottenham loanee Pritchard has been key in their surprise success story. Short, agile, quick and versatile, Pritchard is in the Spanish mould of midfielder we have been craving for so long in this country. Given Mauricio Pochettino's track record of developing youth it wouldn't be a surprise to see him in Spurs' squad next season though they may opt to loan him out  to a smaller Premier League club. Alex Pritchard takes on Liverpool's Emre Can during an Under 21 international last month. Tyrone Mings. Club: Ipswich. Position: Left back. Age: 22. Games: 35. Goals: 1. Linked with Arsenal and Crystal Palace in January, Mings' form has tailed off of late with Ipswich's but he has all the attributes required to succeed at the highest level. Tall for a full back at 6ft 5in Mings is nonetheless quick and full of attacking intent. He was let go by both Southampton and Bristol Rovers as a teen before arriving at Ipswich in 2012 via non-league. Giant Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings attracted interest from Premier League clubs in January. We\u2019ve also come up with a composite XI made up by the best players from the eight clubs. This side would surely stay up in the Premier League with ease... Composite XI (4-2-3-1): John Ruddy (Norwich); Dominic Iorfa (Wolves), Russell Martin (Norwich), Steve Cook (Bournemouth), Tyrone Mings (Ipswich); Will Hughes (Derby), Bradley Johnson (Norwich); Matt Ritchie (Bournemouth), Alex Pritchard (Brentford), Bakary Sako (Wolves); Troy Deeney (Watford).\n","right_summary":"Championship top eight separated by just nine points with game to go.

{"document":"A mere 53 hours to kick-off and all is serene at the training base of Queens Park Rangers. Mowers clip along on distant pitches as the sun beats down and the whitewashed pavilion is brightened by pots of forget-me-nots, a flower which could be adopted as the emblem of relegation. QPR boss Chris Ramsey appears relaxed and untroubled, insisting he had more sleepless nights coaching Tottenham last season and joking about the difference between Lidl and Waitrose. His job is to chase pressure and negativity away at times like this, but beneath the surface fear tightens its grip on those near the drop zone. QPR boss Chris Ramsey (centre) is one of seven managers trying to keep their club in the Premier League. Ramsey's side host West Ham on Saturday as they look to climb out of the relegation zone with four games left. Cesc Fabregas' 88th minute strike saw Chelsea grab a late 1-0 win at QPR earlier this month. It will be the same at Newcastle, Aston Villa, Leicester, Sunderland and Hull. Even at Burnley, where Sean Dyche was keen on Thursday to stress his club feel no pressure because their financial commitments are so much less than their rivals. \u2018We are probably half the wage bill of the next team in the division, let alone all the superpowers, and half the spending of the next team in the division,\u2019 said Dyche. The financial implications are bigger for others but there still exists a fear of sporting failure, a fear of letting people down, a fear of losing your job, your status, security, your self-esteem. These everyday, human anxieties trouble Premier League footballers, too. When Cesc Fabregas celebrated Chelsea\u2019s winner in the 88th minute at Loftus Road two weeks ago, Ramsey curled into a ball on the touchline and bottled up his fury until he was well clear of the dressing room. \u2018It was old-school,\u2019 he smiled. \u2018I was a little bit angry. The cat was running. I was so disappointed, probably the most disappointed I\u2019ve been. It was a very soft goal and it would have given us a massive lift to know we could compete with a team of that calibre.\u2019 Four of the bottom seven did not play in the Barclays Premier League last weekend and watched helplessly as Leicester won again, tightening the pack. Burnley manager Sean Dyche says his side have had to compete with the smallest wage budget in the league. NEWCASTLE. Swansea (Home) - April 25. Leicester (Away) - May 2. West Brom (Home) - May 9. QPR (Away) - May 16. West Ham (Home) - May 24. ASTON VILLA. Man City (Away) - April 25. Everton (Home) - May 2. West Ham (Home) - May 9. Southampton (Away) - May 16. Burnley (Home) - May 24.

Having reached the point where all seemed lost, perhaps the pressure left Nigel Pearson\u2019s team. They have won three on the bounce. Now, off the bottom at last, it will get tense again as they head for Turf Moor. Pearson said: \u2018I\u2019m delighted. It\u2019s a very difficult feat to achieve for any side, let alone one on the foot of the table. But we\u2019re not in a position to sit back and enjoy it. \u2018My perspective is that we\u2019re still in the bottom three. The danger is there\u2019s an assumption the hard work is done. Far from it.\u2019 Sunderland\u2019s Dick Advocaat and QPR\u2019s Ramsey have fixed their survival targets at 35 points. Hull\u2019s Steve Bruce thinks he might get away with 34. At Newcastle, John Carver has 35 and is still uneasy. Leonardo Ulloa was on the scoresheet as Leicester  beat Swansea 2-0 in the Premier League on April 18. That win elevated Nigel Pearson's (right) side off the bottom of the table and into 18th in the Premier League. Newcastle manager John Carver believes his team need four points from five games to avoid relegation. How the league form table looks like as of April 23. \u2018You can never tell,\u2019 said Carver. \u2018For me, we need four points from five games. The unexpected can happen. Look at Sunderland.\u2019 Sunderland were last year\u2019s Houdini: bottom with six to play and doomed according to many by virtue of a daunting fixture list. Then they drew at Manchester City, won at Chelsea and Manchester United and then beat relegation rivals Cardiff and West Brom. They lost the last game and still finished in 14th, five points clear, helped by Connor Wickham\u2019s burst of five goals in three games. Wickham has scored only four since - no-one at Sunderland has more in the Premier League this season \u2014 and these acts of escapology are more difficult without a goal supply. Christian Benteke with eight in seven has boosted Aston Villa. \u2018For him to be at a club fighting at the bottom is a mismatch,\u2019 said Tim Sherwood, but Villa still require points as they head to Manchester City. QPR have 17-goal Charlie Austin. Will he be enough? Burnley have Danny Ings, almost out of contract and without a goal in more than two months. Hull\u2019s top scorer Nikica Jelavic is injured. The cost of relegation is estimated at \u00a360million by football finance expert Professor Rob Wilson of Sheffield Hallam University. Connor Wickham scored five goals in three games last season to help Sunderland avoid relegation. \u2018We normally say promotion is worth \u00a3100-120m,\u2019 said Professor Wilson. \u2018Relegation is harder to quantify. Clubs won\u2019t get the full TV rights payment which is about \u00a380m but they will get parachute payments. Sponsors pay a premium for the Premier League and those deals will end and salaries can quickly eat up this smaller revenue if there are no clauses to reduce wages or allow a quick sale. \u2018For a club\u2019s first season in the Championship it\u2019s in the region of a \u00a360m direct cut in revenue.\u2019 Fates unknown, clubs sketch out alternative recruitment strategies. QPR have a dozen players out of contract and, should they go down, Football League penalties are pending for breaking Financial Fair Play rules last season. Charlie Austin has scored 17 goals in the league for QPR this season - but they still find themselves in 19th. Relegated clubs will receive a parachute payment of \u00a325m next season, followed by \u00a320m in 2016-17 and two more of \u00a310m if they do not go back up, as fewer seem to do. No team has bounced straight back with automatic promotion from the Championship since Newcastle and West Bromwich Albion in 2010. West Ham and QPR rebounded via the play-offs and Norwich are in the race this year. The Championship is an unforgiving pit to fall into, with 17 managerial sackings this season and an average tenure of less than a year. \u2018Football has its own laws,\u2019 said Ramsey. \u2018I\u2019d be shopping in Lidl instead of Waitrose. I\u2019ll have a different shopping basket if I look at it from a personal point of view.\u2019 It's truly squeaky bum time in the Premier League relegation battle as just nine points separates the bottom seven teams. Sportsmail asks some of the managers in and among the dog fight what they feel is required for them to avoid the drop this season. CHRIS RAMSEY (QPR) 'If we win three games I think we will stay up. It might take less. I'm not saying that's the definitive amount - but we really need to start winning, starting with this weekend. To do that, we need to concentrate right to the end and make sure that our performances stay similar with a bit more defensive resilience.' QPR manager Ramsey (centre) feels they will avoid relegation if they win three more league games. TIM SHERWOOD (Aston Villa) 'I don't know how many points it will take. We've done alright. Nothing's been achieved yet. I'm a new voice and given them a lot of belief and confidence that they are better than what they were showing. They have managed to score a few more goals and have real belief they can go to places and win. Something was probably a little bit missing previously. I want to make sure that I don't take my foot off pedal. I'll make sure the players don't.' Tim Sherwood (left) believes his appointment at Aston Villa has given them\u00a0a lot of belief and confidence. NIGEL PEARSON (Leicester) 'We've put ourselves in a position now where we have a more realistic chance. That's where we are. If it raises optimism elsewhere, fine. If it applies a bit more pressure on other sides around us, fine also. But as far as I'm concerned it's about making sure we're back to business when we play Burnley. Because it's a really big game for both sides. We've got players in decent form. We want to keep the work ethic that we've shown all season.' Leicester City manager Pearson (right) hopes his side can continue their momentum against Burnley. SEAN DYCHE (Burnley) 'The biggest psychological difference is that others are talking about relegation. Our fuel is about staying in the Premier League. It's a slightly different twist. 'Others are scared of relegation. We're not scared of relegation because we were told by everyone we were going to get relegated. We are actually looking for the goal of being in the Premier League.' Dyche insists his side aren't scared of relegation as a lot of people have written them off in the past.\n","right_summary":"Just nine points separates the bottom seven clubs in the Premier League.

Managers are feeling the pressure and fear of sporting failure. Players from some clubs have not been able to provide enough goals, making the chances of survival slim.

Relegated clubs will receive a parachute payment of \u00a325m followed by \u00a320m in 2016-17, making the task of bouncing straight back up difficult. Burnley is currently at the bottom of the league table with only 26 points, and Newcastle is currently ranked 14th with 35 points; so both clubs are at serious risk of getting relegated. However, if QPR wins three more league games, they may stay in the Premier League."}
{"document":"As England\u2019s supporters settled in for a few pints at the Huntsman pub in the centre of Turin on Tuesday afternoon, a sizeable number spilled on to the street outside to sing the latest anti-IRA song. \u2018**** the IRA,\u2019 it goes \u2014 and it really does go on, and on and on. Inside the Juventus Stadium, with 2,000 travelling England fans seated in the curva at the north west area, there was more of the same. England fans sang anti-IRA songs during Tuesday's friendly draw with Italy at the Juventus Stadium - there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants. Michael Carrick (centre) and the rest of the England squad applaud the travelling support in Turin on Tuesday. Frankly, it is embarrassing to listen to - a stain on our usually good-natured and good-humoured travelling supporters as we look ahead to June\u2019s friendly with the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. It also places a strain on the FA. What can they do when thousands of travelling fans are singing: \u2018Where were you in World War Two,\u2019 or the German bomber song that has been heard for many years on our overseas trips? Toe-curling stuff. As for the IRA songs, many of the younger fans who join in with these chants cannot know or understand the significance of the Irish political situation and how it affected Britain through the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties. In Dublin there will be the issue of provocation, the potential to engage with a city that has traditionally been a political hotspot.There is barely time to catch our breath before England\u2019s 3,000 supporters head to the Aviva Stadium for the first fixture against the Republic of Ireland since 1995. It was at Lansdowne Road on February 15 that year when rioting England fans - many of them associated with the neo-Nazi group Combat 18 - caused the fixture with Jack Charlton\u2019s side to be abandoned. England supporters throw missiles at Landsdowne Road 20 years ago, causing the fixture to be abandoned. In the intervening years there have been various conversations between the FA and the FA of Ireland about a fixture between the teams, but it is only now they can agree that the time is right. Let\u2019s not spoil it. The fixture with Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s labouring team on June 7 is a bookend to the season ahead of the final chapter in Slovenia seven days later. Roy Hodgson is a football man and you can tell by his pained expression at the end of every post-match briefing that he would rather not be answering questions about fans\u2019 behaviour. \u2018We can only hope that in some way we put that right before we go to Ireland because the last thing we want is anything (other) than a very good football match,\u2019 he said after the 1-1 draw with Italy. This is an awkward situation for the FA and yesterday they were reluctant to release another statement condemning the anti-IRA chanting as there is no evidence that it has had a positive effect. It seems by Roy Hodgson's pained expression at the end of post-match briefings that the England boss would rather not be ansering questions about fans' behaviour. The first audible chants of this latest song can be traced back to Celtic Park in November, when England emerged with an uplifting 3-1 victory over Scotland. Life felt good. That was until Hodgson, underprepared for a question about the nature of the chants, answered one with some assistance from a diplomatic member of the FA\u2019s communications team. The FA attempted to defuse the situation by releasing a statement the following day apologising for the behaviour of \u2018a section of the England support\u2019. It read: \u2018We have consistently urged supporters to show respect and not to chant songs that could be regarded as insulting to others - particularly from a religious or political perspective.\u2019 The songs were sung in England's win against Scotland and the FA wanted to make sure they stopped in Turin\u00a0- there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants. The FA are in a tricky position because they are getting hammered by the travelling fans at every away game for the \u2018two caps for Wembley\u2019 loyalty scheme. Previously, those who travelled to watch England were rewarded with double the \u2018caps\u2019, giving greater access to restricted-allocation European Championship and World Cup tickets. Now, fans who attend home games get twice the points instead. The FA would do well to take a closer look at this policy in an effort to placate the supporters. Is it a fair trade? Probably not, but then it isn\u2019t equitable to inflict anti-IRA songs on the people of Ireland the day before kick-off at the Aviva Stadium, either.\n","right_summary":"England fans sang anti-IRA songs during Tuesday's draw with Italy.

{"document":"Can Rickie Lambert sue for restraint of trade? Brendan Rodgers has killed off Lambert's career and you've got to feel sorry for the player. You can't blame him for joining Liverpool \u2013 why would he turn that down? At the time he was a confident striker \u2013 playing regularly in the Premier League and scoring goals for Southampton. He'd just been to a World Cup. Rickie Lambert has scarcely been given a chance since joining Liverpool despite their striking problems. Brendan Rodgers' decision to ignore Lambert, in favour of Mario Balotelli, is completely illogical. This time last year Lambert was about to play at a World Cup for England but his stock has fallen since. For Rodgers to ignore him when they have desperately needed goals is illogical. I'm well aware Lambert isn't Luis Suarez, I know he's not a world-class striker. Lambert missed out on Saturday at West Brom because of a hip injury but it must have been gutting for him to see Mario Balotelli get yet another chance. The England striker played 90 minutes 20 times last season, made 31 starts, and unlike any Liverpool player in the scoring charts this season, easily got into double figures. Contrast that with this campaign when in terms of Premier League minutes on the pitch Lambert has played the equivalent of roughly six-and-a-half games. Lambert has enjoyed the opportunity to score for his boyhood team but he deserves more football. When he has started in the Premier League or Champions League, Lambert and Liverpool have impressed. On his first Premier League start for Liverpool he scored, and when he played 90 minutes in four consecutive games he scored in the first game, Liverpool won the next two, and drew the fourth. And then he was dropped again and hasn't started since. Meanwhile, Balotelli regularly gets more time on the pitch, and regularly fails to deliver. He has to go down as Liverpool's worst-ever signing \u2013 at least the club won a trophy when Andy Carroll was at Anfield. How come Balotelli got more time on the pitch at Wembley last weekend than Lambert? And what about Saturday? Balotelli was hopeless yet again. Whether you watch his performance or check the stats, he was useless \u2013 not for the first time this season. Ultimately it'd be wrong to suggest Lambert was going to be the man to spearhead Liverpool's charge to the title and a Champions League challenge. But to be so underused in a season when Daniel Sturridge has been missing for so long, and Balotelli has been ineffective, is inexplicable. Balotelli, no matter which way you look at it, has been useless, and Lambert should be picked ahead of him. Balotelli was given more time on the pitch than Lambert in Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Villa. Lambert scored 20 goals for Southampton - he may not be world class, but he is better than the alternatives. Lambert should have joined Aston Villa in January. But he found out about the move just a few hours before the transfer window closed and chose to stay. Rodgers told Lambert that he didn't want him to go. Why say that and then not bother using him? Nobody can ever take away the fact that Lambert has scored for his boyhood club Liverpool in the Premier League and the Champions League. And Lambert is the kind of guy who will treasure those special moments and keep them close to his heart. But he's lost his England place and his reputation as a Premier League striker has been seriously undermined by Rodgers and Liverpool this season.\n","right_summary":"Rickie Lambert has barely played since joining from Southampton.

{"document":"Former Barcelona and Brazil forward Ronaldinho marked a late cameo in Queretaro's surprise 4-0 thumping of Club America with a brace. The 2002 World Cup winner came on as the game approached full-time but still struck in the 85th and 90th minutes following earlier goals from Yasser Corona, who struck midway through the first half, and Orbelin Pineda's on the stroke of half-time. Tigres Monterrey moved up to fourth in the Clausura after eventually easing to a 3-0 home victory over Monterrey. Queretaro playmaker Ronaldinho celebrates during his side's emphatic 4-0 win over Club America. Ronaldinho (centre) rolled back the years by scoring two goals in quick succession during the Liga MX match. The 35-year-old replaced\u00a0Queretaro team-mate\u00a0Emanuel Villa with just six minutes left on the clock. Lugo Aranda's 56th-minute goal put the home side in front but it was not until the closing stages when they put the game to bed. Rafael Sobis doubled Tigres' lead in the 83rd minute before substitute Esqueda Tirado added gloss to the scoreline four minutes later, scoring almost immediately after coming off the bench.

{"document":"Forget the must-have wine cellar, hot-tub or \u00a31,700 Italian coffee-maker \u2014 the latest domestic fashion is for private home cinemas. Many of the super-rich are having them built \u2014 complete with huge comfy seats and cup-holders, eardrum-blasting surround-sound systems, massive screens and even cocktail bars and popcorn-makers. Celebrities with a home cinema include the Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch, retail tycoon Sir Philip Green and Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. And this week we learnt that the Beckhams want one, too. Forget the must-have wine cellar, hot-tub or \u00a31,700 Italian coffee-maker \u2014 the latest domestic fashion is for private home cinemas. A planning application submitted for their 1860s home in London\u2019s Holland Park shows drawings for a lower-groundfloor \u2018cinema room\u2019. And the word \u2018cinema\u2019 \u2014 suggestive of a large scale \u2014 is entirely appropriate. The ceiling height would be 9.5ft, and the room measures some 300 sq ft \u2014 just over twice the size of the average British living room. That means the Beckhams could easily fit 20 seats \u2014 enough for their family of six plus friends \u2014 in the room which would adjoin a 500 sq ft playroom. In this \u2018Beckham Odeon\u2019, a projector and pull-down screen would be built into the \u2018non-historic\u2019 ceiling. Having hired the ultra-swish interiors guru Rose Uniacke, one can safely assume it will be much classier than your local multiplex. Meanwhile, George Clooney, who has recently purchased a \u00a310million manor house with his barrister wife Amal on an island in the Thames in Sonning, Berkshire, is also building a home cinema. It will be in a new complex, set apart from the house, that includes a pool, a \u2018professional kitchen\u2019, a pergola and a bar. Draft layouts lodged with the local planning office reveal that the cinema will have 12 seats, behind which there will be an audio\/video room which will house the banks of electronics required. George Clooney, who has recently purchased a \u00a310million manor house with his barrister wife Amal (right) on an island in the Thames in Sonning, Berkshire, is also building a home cinema. And it is unlikely that Hollywood celebrities such as Clooney are waiting for films to come out on DVD \u2014 no doubt eager publicists and production companies send George et al movies even before they are issued on general release. Not far from the Beckhams in West London, pop star Robbie Williams lives in a 46-room house that was previously owned by the late film director Michael Winner. A planning application submitted for David Beckham's (above) home earlier this week showed plans for a 'cinema room' Williams has sought planning permission to build an underground complex that features a pool and home cinema (although Winner had already installed an impressive cinema with photos of his own movies on the walls). However, as well as these celebrities, Russian oligarchs and retail tycoons, there is an increasing trend for normal families to install home cinemas. Magdalen Rees, owner of Chelsea Connected, an audiovisual and internet installation firm, says: \u2018Like swimming pools, home cinemas set the status of the house. \u2018Many clients want the whole cinema experience, complete with banks of theatre-style seating.\u2019 She says that one client had his own study-sized cinema built in his \u2018man cave\u2019 \u2014 complete with a solo cinema seat that was a present from his wife. So, how much does a home cinema cost? \u2018I\u2019ve installed all the technology \u2014 projector, screen, amplifier, speakers and control unit \u2014 for less than \u00a310,000,\u2019 says Mrs Rees. \u2018But the real expense is on the rest of the room \u2014 the seating, decoration and lighting which automatically dims when the movie starts, giving that complete cinema feel.\u2019 But with the average cost of a family visit to the cinema costing \u00a3100 (including tickets, transport and food), it almost starts to look like good value. No matter your budget, it is possible to get something approaching the multi-millionaire home cinema experience. If you have a spare room that you can dedicate, then so much the better \u2014 but you don\u2019t have to be a Hollywood star to watch in film\u2011star style. While the home cinemas found in celebrity homes might have popcorn makers, it is easy to make some yourself. Here are the best ways to get your home cinema up and running... Under \u00a31,000. At this level, buying a projector is out of your league. Your best bet is to shop around for a discounted 55in TV, such as the Samsung UE55H6670 \u2014 \u00a3799 from Currys. To improve the sound quality, invest in a soundbar \u2014 a slimline unit that houses lots of small speakers \u2014 such as the Yamaha YAS103, available from Richer Sounds for \u00a3149 (richersounds.com). This leaves you with \u00a352 to spare, which you may consider spending on six old cinema chairs currently available on eBay for \u00a348. With the remaining \u00a34, you can buy four boxes of Butterkist salted microwave popcorn, available from Tesco for \u00a31 per box. Installation can be done yourself. Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch (above) also has a home cinema. Under \u00a35,000. Although you can buy a decent projector for under this price, that will leave you with very little for speakers, seating and all those other extras. It makes more sense to buy a 75in TV, such as the Samsung UE75H6400 \u2014 \u00a32,498.97, also from Currys. This could then be combined with a soundbar, a subwoofer speaker that delivers thudding bass and two wireless surround-sound speakers. The best package for all this is the Sonos playbar + SUB + 2 X play: 1, which costs \u00a31,534 (smarthomesounds.co.uk). With nearly \u00a31,000 left over, you can buy four LC7027 leather cinema chairs from Amazon at \u00a3219 each, and have enough to buy almost \u00a3100 worth of snacks. If you are handy with a power drill and have enough muscle around to lift up the TV set, installation can be DIY. Over \u00a35,000. If you have a big budget, consider buying a projector. You can plug any media device into it, including a set-top box such as an Apple TV, or a Blu-ray or DVD player, or stream the internet. The Epson EH-TW9200 costs \u00a32,799 and is almost as good as what you\u2019ll get at the cinema. Don\u2019t skimp on the screen or just project on to a white wall. To get the best picture, look at the FrontStage Motorised Home Cinema Projector Screen HDTV, 197in x 147in, which is \u00a31,078 on Amazon. You will then need an amplifier, and at this level you should invest in anything that features Dolby\u2019s stunning new Atmos technology for the most advanced surround-sound. Try the Denon AVRX5200 Networked 4K Home Cinema Receiver at around \u00a31,329. Buy a range of at least 11 speakers, including wall and ceiling units, as well as multiple subwoofers. Aim to spend \u00a3250 per speaker at the very least. Finally, invest in some Premiere Home Cinema chairs from Drinkstuff on eBay at \u00a31,299 each. These feature incliners, footrests and backrests, storage boxes, cup-coolers and even cup-warmers. Installation will have to be done by a professional, as projectors and screens need careful mounting.\n","right_summary":"Sir Philip Green and Benedict Cumberbatch also enjoy home cinemas.

{"document":"Dogs can sniff out prostate cancer with 98 per cent reliability, a new study has shown. The research, carried out in Milan, backs up tests carried out by the charity Medical Detection Dogs. Its co-founder Dr Claire Guest said the charity's research found a 93 per cent reliability rate when detecting both prostate and bladder cancer. She hailed the new study, describing the findings as 'spectacular'. Dogs have been found to detect prostate cancer with 98 per cent accuracy when sniffing men's urine samples. The latest research, by the Department of Urology at the Humanitas Clinical and Research Centre in Milan, involved two dogs sniffing the urine of 900 men - 360 with prostate cancer and 540 without. Scientists found that dog one got it right in 98.7 per cent of cases, while for dog two this was 97.6 per cent . They said the dogs are able to detect prostate cancer specific volatile organic compounds in the urine but said an important question remains of how a dog would find it in daily practice. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Dr Guest said: 'These results are spectacular. They offer us further proof that dogs have the ability to detect human cancer. 'It is particularly exciting that we have such a high success rate in the detection of prostate cancer, for which the existing tests are woefully inadequate.' She said there is currently a 'reluctance to embrace this tested, time-old technology' but dogs can pick up a scent in a dilution of one to a thousand parts. There is no single test for prostate cancer, but the most commonly used are blood tests, a physical examination or a biopsy.

{"document":"Accused: Officer Aaron Stringer, from Bakersfield, California, allegedly pulled on the toes and 'tickled' the feet of a man whom police had recently killed. A police officer who allegedly 'loves playing with dead bodies' has been accused of 'tickling' the feet and yanking on the head and toes of a dead man who had been recently shot killed by cops. Aaron Stringer, of the Bakersfield, California, Police Department, reportedly said 'tickle tickle' as he ran his fingers along the soles of the feet of Ramiro James Villegas, a 22-year-old whom officers killed the same day. A trainee police officer who was with him at the time told how Stringer then pulled on the corpse's toes, and pulled his head back and forth while discussing rigor mortis after the shooting on November 13. According to the Bakersfield Californian, he then said that he 'loves playing with dead bodies' and later told her to lie about what she'd seen. Stringer has been on paid administrative leave from the department since it started investigating the chilling accusations in November. Villegas was shot dead by police after crashing his car in a high-speed chase, ABC23 reported. Officers say they gunned him down after he got out of the car and reached for his waistband, raising fears that he had a gun. It later became clear that he wasn't armed. Stringer, who filed a police report about the day's activities, mentioned interviewing witnesses alongside trainee Lindy DeGeare, who eventually blew the whistle on the alleged corpse manipulation. Shot dead: Ramiro James Villegas, 22, had been shot dead on November 13 by Bakersfield Police after a car chase. Stringer allegedly 'played' with his body as it lay under a bloodied sheet. Let in: Stringer was allowed to see the body by a nurse at the Kern Medical Center, above. She said Stringer volunteered them to head to the Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield to help identify the body. It was there that a nurse gave them the passcode to the morgue where Villegas was being held. She said that when Stringer suggested she take a look at the body, she presumed it was part of legitimate training. Under California law, police officers are allowed to look at dead bodies to assess wounds, but are not supposed to handle them. According to the Bakersfield California, local prosecutors considered charging Stringer but dropped the case due to insufficient evidence. He is currently being investigated internally by the police department. A lawyer for the Villegas family said they are also 'very close' to filing a suit of their own.

{"document":"Watching the first male skier to ever clinch four straight World Cup titles fly through snowcapped slopes is impressive enough. But talented Marcel Hirscher added a little extra flare to his downhill slalom run by bringing the pistes alive with a colourful display. The skier teamed up with The Red Bull Media House and Starelation to create the unusual stunt, using coloured powder packed into the poles he swerved around. Rainbow run! Marcel Hirscher performs during the project 'Marcel Hirscher Colours' at Reiteralm near Schladming. Blue eruption! The coloured powder was flung across the slopes as the talented skier went passed. 'It was a surreal experience \u2013 simply amazing!' said the four times World Champion skier, Marcel Hirscher. 'We wanted to bring a new, cool element into skiing,' Hirscher said on the Red Bull website' The process involved 11 cameras, a specially-enhanced slope, and three days to set up before creating the incredible video in one take with the 26-year-old Austrian. Marcel Hirscher slalomed in and out of poles filled to the brim with coloured, biodegradable powder, which erupted upon contact. Six GoPros, and a range of other cameras, including a hand held one by the skier captured the dazzling rainbow effect, which surrounded him at every turn. As the run required more ice than snow, a section of the Reiteralm slopes in Austria had to be watered, so that it could freeze over night in preparation. The team had to get up at 4am to set up the cameras to capture the rainbow run in one take from a number of angles, before the ice melted. The most difficult part of the incredible video as filming it from all angles, without getting another cameraman in the shot. 'We wanted to bring a new, cool element into skiing,' Hirscher said on the Red Bull website, 'and create unforgettable images. And I think we succeeded!' 'It was a surreal experience \u2013 simply amazing! I couldn't ski with the speed I normally do in races, even though the course was very steep in the first part, up to 75 percent incline,' he explains. 'At each gate I was blinded for a split second because I had to ski through a cloud of yellow and blue.' The team had to get up at 4am to set up the cameras to capture the rainbow run from a number of angles, before the ice melted during the day. The biodegradable powder was placed in slalom poles along the course, and multiple cameras were set up to capture the effect from different angles. Rainbow powder!\u00a0After winning the overall World Cup title four years in a row, alpine skier Marcel Hirscher took a day off and had some fun at his local resort with his race skiis and some crazy colors, resulting in one of the most vibrant ski runs to date. Talented! This year the skier became the first men's skier ever to clinch a fourth straight World Cup overall title. Respect for the environment was a priority from the beginning of this project! The team has assured that the plants and wildlife have neither been damaged nor disturbed at any time during the project. Marcel's explosive slalom run is a Red Bull Media House production realised by Starelation. Record achievement! This year Hirscher became the first male alpine skier to win the overall World Cup title four times in a row. Respect for the environment was a priority from the beginning of this project!

The team picked vibrant colours which would contrast heavily with the crisp white snow. The team wanted to get as close as they could to the skier but without any cameramen appearing in any shots. One chance! The team knew they had one attempt to get the shot, as once the powder had been released it would ruin any other shots. Born in Annaberg-Lung\u00f6tz, Salzburg, Hirscher made his World Cup debut in March 2007. Marcel's father Ferdinand Hirscher said on his website: 'Marcel and I have been travelling to various races since his childhood. I contribute with my experience from this. I make sure that we \u2013 together with the coaches and the service crew \u2013 get to the maximum as a team.' The talented skier has 30 pairs of ski boots and 100 pairs of Atomic Redster racing skies prepared for use before every season. Impressive feat!

Additionally, Marcel used his specially designed racing suit, which had an inbuilt projector, to provide a stunning effect. The highly-anticipated event took place in the Alps, where Marcel showed off his impeccable skills. Dozens of high speed cameras and  specialized equipment were placed across the course to capture the historic moment from different angles, including the latest drone technology.

{"document":"Panama City (CNN)This was the handshake that shook the Western Hemisphere. President Obama briefly met his Cuban counterpart, Raul Castro, on Friday night at a dinner for the dozens of Latin American leaders convening in Panama City for the Summit of the Americas. This was historic. The two nations have barely been on speaking terms -- officially -- for more than 50 years. The meeting was so important that Bernadette Meehan, National Security Council spokesperson, issued a statement: \"At the Summit of the Americas this evening, President Obama and President Castro greeted each other and shook hands.\" Cuba and the United States had endured a half-century of enmity, the tension worsened by the two nations being only 90 miles apart. Key events of those years include some of the most traumatic in modern U.S. history, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Bay of Pigs and the Mariel boatlift of 1980. But the two leaders have been building up to the historic face-to-face. Obama spoke by phone Wednesday with the Cuban leader before heading to Panama. They met Friday at the dinner and are expected to spend a lot more time together on Saturday when the summit begins in earnest. Obama arrived in Panama late Thursday for the conference, which in years past was tinged with animosity at Cuba's exclusion. Moments after Marine One, Obama's helicopter, touched down in Panama City, Castro's plane landed on the same tarmac. Panamanian television carried both arrivals live. During their phone call Wednesday, Obama and Castro discussed the ongoing process of normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba, according to Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes. He said it \"made sense\" for the two leaders to communicate before their anticipated interactions Friday and Saturday. Those run-ins will represent the highest-level talks between the United States and Cuba since a meeting between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and then-Prime Minister Fidel Castro in 1959. \"We're in new territory here,\" Rhodes said on Friday. \"The reason we're here is that the President strongly believes that an approach that was focused totally on isolation, focused totally on seeking to cut off the Cuban people from the United States of America had failed.\" Obama was expecting a warm welcome from the dozens of countries represented at the conference, after announcing in December he was seeking to engage Havana in talks over reopening embassies and removing barriers to commerce and travel. In Panama, Obama is expected to announce he's removing Cuba from the United States' list of countries that sponsor terrorism, a major advance in building diplomatic ties between the two countries. The State Department delivered its report on the designation to the White House on Wednesday; Obama said on Thursday a panel of experts was reviewing it before he makes a final determination. The White House isn't ruling out a final decision before Obama leaves Panama late Saturday night. In remarks during a brief stopover in Jamaica on Thursday, Obama strongly hinted he was ready to remove Cuba from the list, which also includes Iran, Sudan and Syria. \"Throughout this process, our emphasis has been on the facts,\" Obama said. \"So we want to make sure that given that this is a powerful tool to isolate those countries that genuinely do support terrorism, that when we make those designations we've got strong evidence that, in fact, that's the case.\" \"As circumstances change, then that list will change as well,\" he said. While some inside Cuba have expressed dissatisfaction at the pace of the diplomatic thaw, U.S. officials say they're pleased at the progress toward re-establishing diplomatic ties, which the White House argues has helped improve relations with other countries in the region. Obama said in Jamaica he \"never foresaw that immediately overnight everything would transform itself.\" The overtures to Cuba have not been universally popular in the United States; some lawmakers were irate that Obama was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government. Even as Obama landed in Panama the long-standing tensions between pro- and anti-Castro activists was on full display. Dissidents opposed to Castro's regime were violently accosted earlier this week by supporters of the Cuban government. Rhodes said the White House had \"expressed serious concerns\" about the violence and would continue to speak in support of human rights reforms on the island.\n","right_summary":"U.S. President Obama, Cuban President Raul Castro meet in Panama City.

Model Chrissy Teigen proudly showed off her stretch marks in an Instagram post that has been praised by her fans. And the singer Pink hit back at critics who fat shamed her for an outfit she wore to a recent charity event alongside her husband Carey Hart. Scroll down for video. Model Chrissy Teigen was praised this week as she posted a picture of herself to Instagram showing off her stretch marks. Chrissy's fans were happy that she shared the picture, with one of them commenting that 'real women' have stretch marks. Chrissy, 29, posted the picture of her thighs which had clear stretch marks on them saying: 'Bruises from bumping kitchen drawer handles for a week. Stretchies say hi!' She received praise from many fans, such as Instagram user @saraelizabef \u00a0who said: 'Love it! Real women have stretch marks #respect'. Another follower, @emmalittle5, commented: 'I have so much respect for you! I have stretchies too and I appreciate someone being real about them and acknowledging them thanks.' Meanwhile, Pink took to Twitter to speak out against those who had commented on her weight at an event she attended to support a doctor friend. She said: 'I can see that some of you are concerned about me from your comments about my weight. 'You\u2019re referring to the pictures of me from last night\u2019s cancer benefit that I attended to support my dear friend Dr Maggie DiNome. The singer Pink hit back at those who criticised her weight at an event recently, saying that she was happy with her body. In a message posted to her Twitter account Pink jokingly referred to herself as 'cheesecake' and said that she felt beautiful in her dress. She continued: 'She was given the Duke Award for her tireless efforts and stellar contributions to the eradication of cancer. But unfortunately, my weight seems much more important to some of you. 'While I admit that the dress didn\u2019t photograph as well as it did in my kitchen, I will also admit that I felt very pretty. In fact, I feel beautiful. 'So, my good and concerned peoples, please don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m not worried about me. And I\u2019m not worried about you either:)\u2026. 'I am perfectly fine, perfectly happy, and my healthy, voluptuous and crazy strong body is having some much deserved time off. Thanks for your concern. Love, cheesecake.' And Chrissy and Pink aren't the first stars to make comments about their bodies or to be keen to show off their more natural selves. Kelly Clarkson recently gave an interview to Ellen DeGeneres in which she said that she was used to being bullied about her weight. Recently Kelly Clarkson gave an interview to American chat show host Ellen DeGeneres in which she discussed how she had been facing criticism for her weight for years. She said: 'I\u2019m such a creative person that I yo yo. So sometimes I\u2019m more fit and I get into kickboxing hardcore. And then sometimes I don\u2019t and I\u2019m like.. I\u2019d rather have wine.' 'We are who we are. Whatever size,' Kelly told Ellen, prompting applause from the studio audience. 'You know, if it\u2019s you, you\u2019re just like whatever,' she said. 'I think what hurts my feelings..... is that I\u2019ll have a meet and greet after the show and a girl who is, like, bigger than me will be in the meet and greet and be like, 'wow, if they think you\u2019re big, I must be so fat to them.' In 2012 Girls star and producer Lena Dunham hit back after she was criticised for wearing a pair of short shorts on the red carpet. In 2012 Lena Dunham recieved harsh criticism for this outfit. She said she didn't think a thinner woman would have been criticised in the same way. Lena told her critics: 'I am going to live to be 100, and I am going to show my thighs every day till I die.' She said at the time: 'Last week I wore something to an event...a big top and little shorts, and a bunch of [blog posts] came out that I had been out without pants [trousers],' 'I actually saw it...'Love it or hate it: The no-pants look.' My mom...thought it was so funny. 'My boyfriend was like, 'People seem to be worked up about you going out without pants.' But I didn't go out without pants! I had shorts on.' Lena continued: 'If Olivia Wilde had gone to a party in...little shorts, she might have been on a 'weird dressed list' or been told her outfit was cute. 'I don't think a girl with tiny thighs would have received such no-pants attention. I think what it really was...'Why did you all make us look at your thighs?' 'My response is, get used to it because I am going to live to be 100, and I am going to show my thighs every day till I die.' Tyra Banks' weight has gone up and down over the years and the model says that anyone who doesn't like the way she looks can kiss her fat a**. Former supermodel Tyra Banks similarly hit back after she was subject to mean remarks about her fuller figure. She said: 'To all of you that have something nasty to say about me, or other women that are built like me, women that sometimes or all the time look like this, women whose names you know, women whose names you don't, women who have been picked on, women whose husbands put them down, women at work or girls in school \u2014 I have one thing to say to you. Kiss my fat a**!' In 2014 when she was criticised for her appearance at the Golden Globes actress\u00a0Gabourey Sidibe had the perfect response to her haters. She said: 'To the people making mean comments about my [Golden Globes] pics, I mos def cried about it on that private jet on the way to my dream job last night #jk.'\n","right_summary":"This week Chrissy Teigen shared a picture of her stretch marks.

The Bundesliga champions conceded twice in the opening 10minutes before losing 3-1 to the Portuguese in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday. Der Kaiser may be a brand ambassador for the club but he couldn't hide his feelings after the game, when he criticised defender Dante for playing as if he were wearing 'ski boots' before turning on the entire team. Franz Beckenbauer was speaking in New York as part of Bayern Munich's\u00a0media agreement with MSN.

'After 10 minutes you are 2-0 down in the quarter-final in the Champions League, so many mistakes. I never saw this before. I thought they took sleeping pills! Porto were much faster, real power.

Bayern players trudge off after defeat knowing they will have to vastly improve to reach the semi-finals. 'If they played like that again, no chance [they can go through]. But they can win 2-0 or go to extra-time. They have a chance. Last year we had the same problem, playing excellent in the Bundesliga and then we had two bad days and were out of the competition.' The 69-year-old did attempt to play down his comments over Dante's performance, he said: 'At half-time, I have to give a comment and that was my reaction. And I'm sorry to give him the ski boots... but he's Brazilian, and Brazilian to me means for me, technique and Pele and... Brazil. But not this.' 'If you want to win the Champions League you need a strong league with a lot of players. Internationally, Bayern Munich belongs to the top teams but to win the Champions League\u2026 you saw the game probably two days ago, we are far, far away.

{"document":"Conor O\u2019Shea has revealed his concern at the increasing force of rugby\u2019s collisions after Harlequins and England full back Mike Brown was consigned to even more time on the sidelines to recover from the latest high-profile head injury. Brown has not played since the final round of the RBS 6 Nations on March 21, is still suffering headaches after a week-long holiday in Dubai and no closer to being declared symptom-free. The episode raises questions about whether the 29-year-old was brought back too early for England\u2019s title-decider against France, having been knocked out in the Test against Italy five weeks earlier following a crunching collision with Andrea Masi. Mike Brown is knocked out in a collision with Italy\u2019s Andrea Masi in the Six Nations last month. Brown was out cold for approximately eight minutes and hasn't played since the Italy game on March 21st. \u2018It\u2019s a concern because I don\u2019t like someone coming in with something you can\u2019t diagnose,\u2019 said O\u2019Shea, Quins\u2019 director of rugby. \u2018Sometimes a physio will sit you down and say, \u201cIt\u2019s six to 12 weeks out\u201d. Here it could be tomorrow or it could be whenever \u2014 we don\u2019t have a timescale. There\u2019s no doubt that a decade or even a year ago Browny would be back out on the pitch. \u2018You want to see the gladiatorial side of things \u2014 the big hits that we\u2019ve all grown up with. It was once a badge of honour that you got up and got on with it. But at least we\u2019re now aware. Is it a concern for the game that we\u2019re seeing collisions of the nature that we are? Yes, it has to be.\u2019 Brown will have played just six of his club\u2019s last 19 games after sitting out of the coming weekend, and his England team-mates Joe Marler and Chris Robshaw have featured in only eight of the last 18. Northampton have ruled out George North, who is suffering from his own concussion problems after being knocked out in three different collisions, until the end of the month and O\u2019Shea must also deal with the absence of one of his marquee players. George North suffered his third concussion in four months during Northampton's defeat to Wasps. \u2018You can look at a succession of events for George North, whereas this is a follow-on of symptoms from one event,\u2019 said O\u2019Shea. \u2018Against Italy it was as big a hit as I\u2019ve seen someone take. It was quite frankly a monstrous hit. I was pretty worried when I saw it live. \u2018Is it tough on us having the England full back for six out of 19 games and still indeterminate? Yes, but there are more important things than rugby.\u2019\n","right_summary":"Brown was consigned to even more time on the sidelines to recover from the latest high-profile head injury. he has not played since the final round of the RBS 6 Nations on March 21, is still suffering headaches after a week-long holiday in Dubai.

{"document":"A 42-year-old man paralyzed in a Utah neighborhood watch shooting and found guilty of repeatedly having sex with a 17-year-old girl is asking an appeals court to either throw out his conviction or reduce his sentence. Attorneys for 42-year-old David Serbeck on Monday told the Utah Court of Appeals that Serbeck's original lawyers should have pushed harder to exclude or dispute allegations tying his 2007 relationship with the 17-year-old victim to his shooting. Two years after he had sex with the 17-year-old, Serbeck was shot and paralyzed in July 2009 by Reginald Campos, who suspected Serbeck of aggressively following his daughter in an SUV while patrolling their Buffdale neighborhood. Campos' daughter and the 17-year-old victim were not the same girl. Motion: Attorneys for 42-year-old David Serbeck, pictured in court in 2010, are asking an appeals court in Utah to either throw out his sex with a minor conviction or sentence. Serbeck (left) was shot and left paralyzed by the teenage victim's angry father, Reggie Campos (right) in July 2009 after the girl told Campos that Serbeck was aggressively stalking her. In March 2012, Serbeck was found guilty of three felony counts of unlawful sex with a minor and sentenced to up to 10 years in prison. His victim testified during the trial that she was 17 when she and Serbeck had sex three times in his Magna home in 2007. The girl visited him under the guise of playing with his pet snakes. Defense claims: Serbeck's attorney says\u00a0the jury gave her client a long sentence after being led to believe that Serbeck was shot while out looking for more girls to exploit. The illicit affair came to an abrupt end when a friend discovered nude pictures on the teen's phone and told her parents. Serbeck staunchly denied the accusations, saying the teen, now 24, had a crush on him and wanted to impress her friends. Now, his defense team wants a new sentence for Serbeck, arguing that during the trial his attorneys failed to push back against claims that he was stalking other girls in July 2009 when he was shot and left paralyzed. Attorney Nathalie Skibine told the appeals justices that her client never got the chance to deny allegations of stalking and sex with other minors during his original trial, reported Deseret News. She also argued that the jury gave her client a long sentence after being led to believe that Serbeck was shot while out looking for more girls to exploit, even though he was never charged with any crime in connection to that incident. Prosecutors countered by saying that it was not the implication that Serbeck was on the hunt for more victims that got him the longer sentence, but rather, as the judge put it during his sentencing, his failure to 'own up' to his actions. \u2018He has no remorse, he denies it and he considers himself the victim,\u2019 Utah Attorney General Jeffrey Gray told the court Monday. On July 22, 2009, David Serbick was patrolling the Buffdale neighborhood with another man when he noticed two girls on the sidewalk, one of them Reginald Campos' teenage daughter. Campos, pictured here with his family, was convicted of attempted murder and aggravated assault in 2010. Reprieve: In September 2013, a judge granted Campos parole. The man, pictured in court in 2010, was released from prison last July. The girl went to her father saying that Serbeck aggressively followed her in his SUV, prompting Campos, a married father of four, to grab his gun and go out looking for his daughter's stalker. Campos eventually found Serbeck and fired two shots at him, severing his spine and leaving him permanently paralyzed from the waist down. In 2010, Campos was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to three years to life in prison, reported KSL.com. He also received a consecutive term of up to five years in prison on a separate aggravated assault charge. But in September 2013, a judge granted Campos parole. He was released from prison in July 2014. The appeals court will rule on David Serbeck's appeal for a new sentence at a later date. He is due to appear before a parole board in September.\n","right_summary":"David Serbeck, 42, was found guilty in 2012 of unlawful sex with a 17-year-old girl in 2007 and sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.

{"document":"Cyril\u00a0Smith took the party whip for four years in Parliament and was feted as a Lib-Dem grandee in the years before he died. Nick Clegg made a desperate bid to distance his party from allegations about Cyril Smith yesterday by calling the paedophile MP a 'Labour politician'. He claimed the obese sexual predator did not belong to the Liberal Democrats at the time he was abusing scores of young boys. In fact Smith took the party whip for four years in Parliament and was feted as a Lib Dem grandee in the years before he died. Mr Clegg was accused on a radio phone-in of having 'washed his hands' of the issue by refusing to order a party investigation into Smith. He insisted there would be no inquiry despite revelations in Saturday's Daily Mail that the Liberal party \u2013 a forerunner to the Lib Dems \u2013 offered hush money equivalent to a month's wages to an activist after she complained about Smith molesting a teenage boy in 1979. Mr Clegg was confronted over the Smith scandal during a phone-in show on LBC radio yesterday. He was asked by 'John from Bexleyheath' why the Lib Dems had not investigated despite new details of Smith's prolific paedophilia exposed in this paper's serialisation of Labour politician Simon Danczuk's book about the late Rochdale MP. Mr Clegg attempted to distance the Lib Dems from Smith and said 'any political party' should co-operate with the police inquiry. He said: 'As it happens, Cyril Smith, as you may know, the allegations surrounding him, actually go right back to the time when he was a Labour politician, back, well before I was even born, I think.' Mr Clegg accused Mr Danczuk of choosing 'to airbrush out the fact that Smith was a Labour politician when he was alleged to have started abusing young children'. He added: 'Cyril Smith was active in politics, by the way, in a party which no longer exists \u2013 the Liberal party. 'So he was a Labour politician, and then he was a politician for most of his career, for a Liberal party, which no longer exists. All this happened well before the Liberal Democrats were even formed.' Mr Clegg said the only way to get justice was for the police to investigate and blamed them for not having done so. Mr Danczuk, the Labour candidate for Rochdale, said his book made it clear that Smith had started out as a member of the Labour party. Nick Clegg made a desperate attempt to distance his party from allegations about Cyril Smith today by calling the paedophile MP a 'Labour politician' He added: 'Nobody will be surprised to hear that Nick Clegg is being disingenuous in his comments. Mr Clegg accused Labour's Simon Danczuk (pictured) of choosing 'to airbrush out the fact that actually Cyril Smith was a Labour politician when he was alleged to have started abusing young children'. 'I urge him to face up to the fact that one of his colleagues \u2013 somebody who he and other members of his party celebrated for very many years \u2013 was a paedophile. 'I think it is a disgrace to try to avoid tackling this issue and to try to politicise this issue in the way that he is doing.' Smith was elected as a Liberal MP in 1972, but after the Lib Dems were formed in 1988 took the whip of the new party until his retirement from Parliament in 1992. He remained a Liberal Democrat grandee up to his death in 2010 at the age of 82. A gushing video tribute from Mr Clegg was played at Smith's 80th birthday party at Rochdale town hall in 2008. The Lib Dem leader told him: 'I'm a great admirer of you personally, but also owe you a great debt of gratitude politically too.' The Daily Mail's serialisation of Mr Danczuk's book, Smile For The Camera: The Double Life Of Cyril Smith, revealed that senior Liberals were made aware of the paedophile MP's abuse. Lord Steel, who as David Steel was Liberal leader from 1976 until 1988 and nominated Smith for a knighthood, was alerted in 1979 to claims that Smith had subjected boys to humiliating spankings but Smith denied any wrongdoing. Senior Lib Dems including the Business Secretary Vince Cable and the former leader Charles Kennedy have insisted they heard nothing. The party has been accused of 'squirming' over the issue.\n","right_summary":"Lib Dem leader makes desperate attempt to distance party from allegations.

{"document":"We have most friends at the age of 26 after having spent the first quarter of our lives building up our friendship circle, a new study has revealed. The report into friendship showed that our social circle peaks at 26 years and seven months, at which we typically have five close friends. Women are most popular at 25 years and 10 months, with men hitting the friendship high point a little later at 27 years and three months. Women are most popular at 25 years of age, while men hit the friendship high a little later at 27. File image used. The research, by greetings card firm Forever Friends, shows that a third of adults (36 per cent) met their closest friends while at school with a fifth (22 per cent) saying they met them at work. Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter now also play a major role in nurturing new friendships. The study found that 25 to 34-year-olds make 22 friends via Facebook, compared to 18 to 24-year-olds who make 12, and 35 to 44-year-olds who will have made just four. Forever Friends relationship coach Sam Owen said: 'It is no coincidence that over a third of us meet our best friends at school. 'It is a key time in our lives where friendships are grown through sharing notes, giving gifts, seeing each other regularly and laughing a lot. 'As adults we can often forget how powerful these small things are and how the little things can make a difference. Small gestures are just as important as big ones. 1. Trustworthy - 85 per cent. 2. Loyal - 79 per cent. 3. Funny - 62 per cent. 4. Respectful - 57 per cent. 5. Have a love of travel - 15 per cent. 6. Thick skinned - 13 per cent. 7. A good taste in music so we can go to the same gigs - 12 per cent. 8. Generous so they can be treated to things - nine per cent. 9. Stylish - seven per cent. 10. Attractive and popular with the opposite sex - six per cent. 'With growing external pressures being put on friendships these days, it's important to nurture and make time for our friendships. 'If we could only do one additional thing a week to show we care and love our friends, it would create a stronger framework for the future.' Later in life we find ourselves losing friends. Over half (54 per cent) of us have lost friendships through moving, while 36 per cent say that over time they grew apart from close pals. Having children has also caused 19 per cent to drift away from childless friends. And new relationships play a big role in finding - and keeping - friends, with one in 10 people (11 per cent) saying their friendship circles had expanded due to a new relationship and 10 per cent revealing their partner did not approve of some. The study also looked into the amount of friends we would like to have. It found that the average Brit has four close friends, but ideally we want six. Tellingly, almost half (48 per cent) of women and 39 per cent of men have at least one secret they share with their best friend, which they would never tell their partner.\n","right_summary":"New study reveals the average person's friends circle peaks at age of 26.

{"document":"Kate Major Lohan has been arrested for a 'drunken attack' on her husband Michael Lohan, TMZ report. Kate - who was ordered to rehab by Michael last year - is said to have had an alcohol relapse before getting physical with the father of Lindsay Lohan. TMZ report that Michael made a 911 call around 7:02pm on Thursday claiming his wife had struck him after coming home inebriated. Scroll down for video... Busted:\u00a0Kate Major arrested AGAIN after she 'drunkenly attacked' Michael Lohan after a heated argument on Thursday at their home in. Their argument then turned physical, with Kate began scratching Michael's back. The site also reports that when police arrived Kate was visibly intoxicated, had slurred speech and blood shot eyes. Kate reportedly admitted she had been drinking, claimed Michael grabbed her by the throat and that the argument was caused by him accusing her of cheating. Fiery: Michael (pictured here with Kate in 2010) was not wearing a shirt during the argument, and his wife reportedly began scratching his back. She was then taken to the Palm Beach Country Jail and charged for battery. A recording of his 911 call, obtained by TMZ, captures Michael pleading for police to come and arrest his wife. \u2018Please ma'am I need help. My wife, she is drunk and on pills and she just attacked me,' Michael says as the sound of a baby crying in background can be heard. When asked if he was okay, he replied: 'I'm more cut up. She just got out of jail. DWI the works. We are locked outside. I think the baby got hurt\u2026 she was hitting me and the baby. I got it all on tape.\u2019 The 911 dispatcher then enquires into what kind of drugs Kate has been using: \u2018Yeah she has been smoking marijuana, and taking pills and she went to get food and came back drunk. She is actually on a detox from alcohol [right now].\u2019 Adding: \u2018She's on Valium and [\u2026]. Yes, prescribed by a doctor, but the marijuana is not.\u2019 The dispatcher then asks if Kate is in need of medical assistance. Family drama: Speaking to TMZ, Michael (pictured with daughter Lindsay and ex wife Dina Lohan in 2003) blamed his ongoing custody battle with Dina for his fiery relationship with his new wife. \u2018No, no, I was running away,\u2019 Michael replies. \u2018I have video [of it all].\u2019 The recording ends with Michael saying, \u2018She is telling our son to say I hit her. Can you believe it? She is crazy. Listen to that drunk.\u2019 Speaking to TMZ, Michael blamed his ongoing custody battle with ex-wife Dina Lohan for his fiery relationship with his new wife. He tells them: 'At the end of the day, this is all because of what Dina is doing in court... It affects Kate too, and like anyone with a drug or alcohol problem, when they can't handle the stress, they resort to drinking.' Last year, Dina filed court documents claiming that Michael refuses to pay for his son Cody's $10,000-a-year school fees. It's not the first time Michael's troubled wife Kate has run into problems with the law. Kate was arrested in March 2013 after Michael called the police following another drunken feud.

Discussing her eating habits with ELLE, she said: 'You know, I'm a carnivore. I really like to eat meat. I crave iron so I am definitely not the kind of person who you will find eating a salad. I like to keep it really balanced to give my body energy and also be healthy.' The busy model and actress says that cooking using fresh ingredients is essential so that she can monitor how much salt and sugar she is putting into her body. While it may not look like it, Emily maintains that it's 'good' to indulge occasionally. She said: 'I wouldn't say I am the type of girl who craves Doritos but I definitely love a good cupcake sometimes.  Or a croissant in the morning. 'I think it is like really important to give yourself a break. And also just really think about where things are coming from what kind of ingredients are going into your body.'

Unclear is whether White includes his work with The White Stripes, The Raconteurs and Dead Weather in his touring history, or just his solo road work. Presumably, he's including all of his touring, with all bands, as Billboard could find only 29 states in which he has performed as Jack White. Tour dates with White Stripes add another 12 states.

{"document":"Burnley manager Sean Dyche has complete confidence that his side will beat relegation. The Clarets are gearing up for the final eight games of their Barclays Premier League survival battle reinvigorated after a warm-weather training camp. Sean Dyche's squad - minus the four players on international duty - spent last week in Spain preparing for a run-in that begins with Sunday's tricky visit of Tottenham. Sean Dyche believes his Burnley side are more than capable of avoiding the Premier League drop. They have a tough battle ahead but recent performances - not least last month's defeat of champions Manchester City - have given hope that a side rated as pre-season relegation favourites can escape the bottom three. The idea of a late-season getaway worked wonders last year, as Dyche's men returned to secure a promotion spot and he hopes for a similar boost this time. The 43-year-old said: 'Last year we found it gave the lads a change and a change is almost as good a rest. We came back and we did the business by getting ourselves promoted. Star man Danny Ings will need to be in top form to get the better of the Tottenham Hotspur defence. 'It's a different kind of challenge this time but we want the same outcome which is to win games and be in the Premier League. 'Wins have been hard to come by - or certainly harder to come by - and it's a big jump in quality but I think slowly but surely we're refocusing on what the job is, learning as we go and delivering good performances. 'I have total belief we will be in the Premier League.' George Boyd (21) celebrates after scoring the winner against Manchester City at Turf Moor. Burnley were written off by many after failing to win any of their opening 10 games but have since proved they are no pushovers. They remain in the relegation zone but were still just three points off 15th place ahead of the weekend fixtures. The Spurs clash is followed by another tough task against Arsenal but Dyche has no doubt his side will push hard. He said: 'I don't know what they're thinking (about us) but I think they know we'll give everything to win a game. That's well documented. They know about the energy and physical desire of the team and behind that there is quality there. Harry Kane has been the player of Tottenham's season and will need to be watched carefully on Sunday. 'Of course that's got to win games. We beat Man City but we need more of that, and it's not always good play but a bit of luck, a decision to go your way every now and then. 'I think our performances have been decent at least. We know they're tough games and the next one will be Tottenham but we'll be ready.' Dyche has dismissed suggestions that his side, inexperienced at the top level, could start flagging as the heat intensifies in the coming weeks. Michael Duff (left) challenges Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez during their clash at the Emirates Stadium. He said: 'Last season there was no sign of that and this season there is no sign of that. 'We will be playing hard in every game to get the points we need to be in the Premier League. It feels like there is no slowing down in what I believe, no slowing down in the training schedules. 'We will be training equally as hard - if not harder on certain days - to be ready for the challenge.'\n","right_summary":"Sean Dyche says his side can avoid relegation from the Premier League.

He had so many friends and everyone's absolutely devastated. 'He was a lovely person and he was a brilliant father. 'Until we see him we can't accept it. We keep getting up in the night and looking for his car down the road.' Kyle Careford, the other man in the car, is thought to have died just days before turning 21. It is believed that one of the men lost control of the Renault Clio they were travelling in as it came round a bend, smashing into a church's stone wall before finishing on its roof. Skid marks lead up to an approximately ten metre long gap in a sandstone wall that was destroyed in the crash. Flowers and tributes have been left at the scene by family and friends. One heartbreaking card to Mr Owen reads: 'To daddy, I love you so much. I'm gonna miss you every day. Love u daddy. Lily and Josh.' Mr Owen was still at school\u00a0when he fathered Lily-Rose with his former partner Lauren Molloy. A card signed by Lauren, believed to be Lily-Rose's mother Ms Molloy, read: 'I can't describe how heartbroken I am. I love you so much and so does our beautiful princess. 'You was an amazing dad and was always there for me. I'm so sorry I didn't let us be a family again. Tragic: Flowers and tributes have been left at the scene of the accident, which happened in front of a church. Crash scene: The wall hit by the car is almost completely demolished and there are skid marks on the road. 'If only I could turn back time I would take you back straight away. I will do everything for our daughter I promise and I will tell her how amazing you are.' The 21-year-old worked in book printing but on Friday he was told he had landed a new job in window screen repair at the same firm as his stepbrother Karl Rabbitt, 36. The brother of Mr Careford led tributes to the pair. In a card left at the scene, brother Ben wrote: 'I can't explain how I am feeling. When you left us this morning to be in God's arms you took a piece of me away. 'I'm not quite sure how to tell your niece Grace that her uncle Kyle is now in heaven. I'm sure he will treasure her Frozen onesie even more now.' Tributes have also been paid to the men on Facebook, with friend, Tyler Scales, writing: 'My deepest sympathy and thoughts go out to all those who have loved and lost. 'Be safe, and think about how lucky you really are. Life can be taken so quick it's unbelievable and very unfair. Big love to all those affected by the loss of life.' Another friend, Sheri Pitman added: 'RIP Kyle. You were such a good kid and never deserved that.' Both men were from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, not far from the crash scene. Moving: One of the many notes left by grieving friends and family at the scene of the crash. After hearing a loud bang, local residents quickly called the emergency services, but the men, who had suffered horrific injuries, are thought to have died instantly. Firefighters had to cut their bodies out of the mangled wreckage. There were no other cars involved in the crash. A spokesman for Sussex Police said: 'At about 12.40am on 12 April a collision occurred in Rotherfield Road, Crowborough. A Renault Clio collided with the wall of the church and overturned. 'There were two male occupants on the car and sadly both were declared deceased at the scene. 'Police are carrying out an investigation into the cause of the collision and to identify the two men in the car. 'Police are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information should contact 101 quoting Operation Lapwing.' It is believed both men will be formally identified tomorrow morning. A spokesman for East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service added: 'We attended the scene and the car was on its roof. There were two young males trapped inside who were declared dead at the scene. 'We had to use cutting gear to get them out but they were already dead.'\n","right_summary":"Crash victims named as Michael Owen, 21, and Kyle Careford, 20.

{"document":"A 250-year-old sex toy has been found by archaeologists during a dig of an ancient toilet in Poland. The eight-inch leather dildo with a wooden head was discovered during an excavation at an old school of swordsmanship in the coastal city of Gdansk. A spokesman for the Regional Office for the Protection of Monuments in Gdansk, said: 'It was found in the latrine and dates back to the second half of the 18th century. Relic: The eight-inch, 250-year-old sex toy was found during a dig at the city of Gdansk in Poland, pictured. 'It is quite thick and rather large, made of leather and filled with bristles, and has a wooden tip that has preserved in excellent condition. It was probably dropped by someone in the toilet. 'Whether that was by accident or on purpose is anyone's guess though.' Archaeologists at the site earlier discovered old swords leading them to suspect that the place was once a school of swordsmanship. The artifact has now been taken away for preservation work. Historical: The 'quite thick' and 'rather large' sex toy was discovered during an excavation of ancient toilets in Gdansk, Poland. Dildos have been found in some form throughout history, with Upper Palaeolithic artefacts previously discovered being said to be likely used for sexual pleasure. For thousands of years, phallic objects have been used symbolically as a means to boost fertility and ward off evil spirits - but their use as sexual aids has a long history, too. A 28,000-year-old phallus recently found in Germany is quoted as being the oldest known 'sex toy' ever found. While phalluses made from stone, wood, leather and even camel dung have all be found during excavations, or referenced throughout historical text and images. And an Austrian museum even has the world's oldest condom on display together with four other condom fragments dated from around 1650. These were found in a toilet at Dudley Castle in England.\n","right_summary":"The 250-year-old toy was made from leather with a wooden head.

{"document":"Two strange, bright flashes on the surface of dwarf planet Ceres may have different origins, according to new infrared images released by Nasa. The images, captured by the Dawn probe from 28,000 miles (45,000km) away, show that a pair of mysterious spots on the dwarf planet have different thermal properties. The images were revealed as part of the first colour map of Ceres, showing variations in surface materials, and revealing the diverse processes that helped shape it. Scroll down for video. Ceres may appear to be a drab, grey world, but new infrared images suggest there is more to the dwarf planet than first thought. The latest images are the closest taken yet, and suggest that the icy body was likely once fully active.\u00a0Images taken using blue (440 nanometers), green (550 nanometers) and infrared (920 nanometers) spectral filters were combined to create the map. 'This dwarf planet was not just an inert rock throughout its history. It was active, with processes that resulted in different materials in different regions,' said Chris Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles. The 'alien' spots on the surface, named feature 1 and feature 5, show up in visible light images as bright flashes in comparison to the rest of Ceres's surface. In infrared, region 1 is cooler than rest of surface, but 5 is located in a region that is similar in temperature to surroundings. Last month, scientists said this pair of mysterious bright spots could be towering 'water volcanoes', but they said they need to take a closer look to confirm this. Federico Tosi, who works on Dawn's Visible and Infrared Spectrometer, presented infrared images of the two spots, measuring their thermal properties. 'What we have found is that bright spot number one corresponds to a dark spot in the thermal image,' he said at a press conference today. Captured by the Dawn probe from 28,000 miles (45,000km) away, the images reveal that two mysterious bright flashes on the surface have different thermal properties.\u00a0The upper trio is Region 1 at visible, infrared and thermal infrared wavelengths.\u00a0At thermal infrared, the spot is dark - meaning it is colder than its surroundings.\u00a0The lower trio represent Region 5. In thermal infrared, the spot disappears. Dawn observed Ceres completing one full rotation, which lasted about nine hours. The images show the full range of different crater shapes that can be found at Ceres' surface: from shallow, flattish craters to those with peaks at their centers. Ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'.\u00a0Scientists think Ceres may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. The Dawn spacecraft pulled into orbit last \u00a0month around the Ceres in the asteroid belt. The probe is currently on the dark side of Ceres and won't emerge until April. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice. But feature five, which appears as two separate bright spots next to each other in visible images, didn't show up in the infrared images. 'Spot number five shows no distinct thermal behaviour,' he said. Dawn is currently too far from its target to find out why this is the case, the scientists added. It may be due to having a different structure, or being made from different material. More detail will emerge after the spacecraft begins its first intensive science phase on April 23, from a distance of 8,400 miles (13,500km) from the surface, said Martin Hoffmann, investigator on the Dawn camera team. The origins of Ceres' bright spots, which have captivated the attention of scientists and the public alike, remain unknown. 'The bright spots continue to fascinate the science team, but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source,' Russell said. Recent images from the Dawn spacecraft reveal feature 5 at various angles as the asteroid rotates. The glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of Ceres, suggesting that they must be high above the surface rather than at the bottom of an impact crater, as previously believed. 'What is amazing is that you can see the feature while the rim is still in the line of sight,' said Andreas Nathues, a planetary scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. Ceres rotates in this sped-up movie comprised of images taken by Nasa's Dawn mission during its approach to the dwarf planet. The glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of Ceres, suggesting that are on a high elevation in relation to the rest of the surface. The 'alien' mark can be clearly seen in images the icy world as the Dawn probe hurtled its way towards a rendezvous on March 6. He noted that at dawn on Ceres, the spots shine brightly, but fade as dusk draws in. According to\u00a0Nature, this could mean sunlight plays an important role in the formation of the features by, for instance, heating up ice just beneath the surface and causing it blast of in a plume. Scientists have speculated that the interior of Ceres is rocky with a layer of water and ice. The leading theory now for the alien spots is that the ice is covered by a thin layer of soil that at times forms into huge 'cryovolcanoes' due to internal pressure in the asteroid. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb (6kg) per second. 'Now, finally, we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious, alien world,' Dawn mission director and chief engineer Marc Rayman, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said. 'Soon it will reveal myriad secrets Ceres has held since the dawn of the solar system.' Ceres is the bright spot in the centre of the image. Because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background, the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible. The long exposure made Ceres appear overexposed, and exaggerated its size A cropped, magnified view of Ceres appears in the inset image at lower left. Dawn will be captured into Ceres' orbit in March, marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft (artist's impression pictured) Ceres orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and is very similar to Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus - both considered potential sources for harbouring life. The presence and abundance of water in bodies like Ceres could have relevance for the origin of life on Earth and the large-scale migration of planets such as Jupiter. One scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early Earth and Moon - delivering organic molecules and water to Earth. Ceres is twice the size of Saturn's geyser-spouting moon Enceladus which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Since launching in 2007, Dawn has already visited Vesta, a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles (168 million km) away from Ceres. The distance between Vesta and Ceres is greater than the distance between the Earth and the sun. During its 14 months in orbit around Vesta, the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights, including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history. Vesta and Ceres are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface.\n","right_summary":"Images from Dawn reveal the mysterious spots on the surface, named feature one and feature five, in infrared.

{"document":"Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century. Evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political, social and cultural undertones, the scale of expectation and outside influences. Where Money Man v PacMan comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. In this, the fifth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history, I look back on one of the greatest sporting events of all time. THE NEAR-DEATH FIGHT. Muhammad Ali v Joe Frazier. The Thrilla in Manila. Quezon City, Philippines. October 1, 1975. Just as they are saying about Mayweather v Pacquiao, the perceived wisdom was that Ali-Frazier was coming five years too late for two great boxers in their 30s. Let us hope they are so spectacularly wrong again. That star-spangled night in New York when Smokin' Joe knocked down and defeated The Greatest had been followed in 1974 by a tamer, scrappier, points victory for Ali. A poster for Muhammad Ali v Joe Frazier, also known as the Thrilla in Manila, in\u00a0Quezon City, Philippines. Ali (right) swings for Frazier, who eventually lost in the 14th round to a technical knockout. And so to the trilogy, a year later. Both men had come through battles with George Foreman, Frazier losing and Ali famously winning The Rumble in the Jungle in Zaire. GEORGE FOREMAN V MUHAMMAD ALI. October 30, 1974, Kinshasa, Zaire. JOE FRAZIER v MUHAMMAD ALI. March 8, 1971, Madison Square Garden, New York. JACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIES. July 4, 1910, Reno, Nevada. JOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELING. June 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York. This time Don King had Manila in mind as the next heavyweight stop for his globe-trotting circus. Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, like Zaire's President Mobuto before him, saw sponsorship of the fight as a distraction from the poverty and social unrest in his country. It was Ali who became most distracted during the build-up. When invited to a photo-opportunity with Marcos and his infamously big-spending wife Imelda, he took his mistress Veronica Porsche along and introduced her as his wife. Mrs Belinda Ali watched that happen on US television and immediately flew to Manila to confront her husband, loudly, in his hotel suite. Ali returned to his customary psychological baiting of his opponents. He had insulted Frazier before their first fight and did so again chanting: 'It will be Killa and a Thrilla and a Chilla when I get The Gorilla in Manila.' Thus the title for the fight, The Thrilla in Manila, was coined. Ali pictured alongside his infamously big-spending wife Mrs Belinda Ali in September 1975. Frazier, the quiet man, was plotting a strategy of breaking down Ali with shots to the stomach, ribs, kidneys and liver, quoting the old ring maxim: 'If you kill the body, the head will die.' Ali would target the Frazier head and won the early rounds while his legs were at their freshest. But it was impossible for him to keep dancing in the pressure-cooker heat, with the ring temperature reaching 120 degrees Fahrenheit. As Muhammad started slowing, Joe began Smokin'. They would engage in one of the most brutal spectacles in the annals of the hardest game. Ali was forced to lower his guard as they landed more than 100 blows to the head between them, each of such force that any one of them would have stopped lesser fighters. Ali supplemented those power shots with his quick jabs and combinations and thereby inflicted more of the facial swelling. Boxing greats Frazier and Ali pictured in the ring on October 1, 1975, for the Thrilla in Manila. Ali and Frazier\u00a0engaged in one of the most brutal spectacles in the annals of the hardest game. Frazier's eyes began closing in the ninth. By the time he came out for the 13th he could barely see and Ali sent his gum-shield flying with the second of two massive right hooks. Exhausted though he was, Ali went for the Killa in the 14th. Although the monstrous barrage which sent Frazier reeling and staggering could not put him down, it was enough to bring a sensational end to an epic battle. Ali ordered his corner-man Herbert Muhammad to cut off his gloves, saying he could not go on. But before he could do so Frazier's trainer Eddie Futch called a halt. A relieved Ali famously said: 'This is the closest to death I have ever been.' Frazier begged to be allowed to see out the 15th and final round but Futch told him: 'It's over. No-one will ever forget what you did here today.' Frazier never forgave him. Not fully. Nor Ali for the trilogy of insults. Ali defied the rigours of Parkinson's to attend Frazier's funeral. Ali lifts his arms in the air after defeating Frazier in the 14th round, but later attended his great opponent's funeral when he died at the age of 67.\n","right_summary":"Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao is now just eight days away.
