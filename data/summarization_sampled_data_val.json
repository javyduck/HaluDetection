{"document":"David Cameron has a 'secret plan' to cut taxes for millionaires after the General Election, Ed Balls claimed today as Labour ramped up its attack on the eighth day of campaigning. The Labour shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost \u00a31,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with 'millions paying more while millionaires pay less'. But the Prime Minister hailed today as 'money-back Monday' - with a raft of tax changes coming into force putting more cash in voters' wallets. Scroll down for video. Ed Balls, speaking in Leeds this morning, ramped up his attack on the Tories today - claiming that David Cameron was planning a VAT increase and cuts to the top rate of tax. Mr Cameron has claimed that Labour are planning to increase taxes by \u00a33,028 on 'every working family'. But, speaking in Leeds this morning, Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over \u00a3150,000 from 45p to 40p. Tory Treasury minister David Gauke hit back with an accusation that Labour has a secret plan to boost revenues by dragging more workers into the 40p higher rate of income tax and increasing national insurance contributions. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' because of his plan to balance the books by spending cuts alone. Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, who cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p in his 2012 Budget, each refused to rule out a further cut to 40p in comments on Sunday. They are expected to come under further pressure on the issue during campaigning in the South West. The Labour shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost \u00a31,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with 'millions paying more while millionaires pay less' Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over \u00a3150,000 from 45p to 40p. Mr Balls said: 'We know that is their secret plan - another big tax cut for millionaires. 'How can it be fair when families here in Leeds and across the country are struggling and \u00a31,100 a year worse-off? 'How can it be fair to have a tax cut for the very richest when our NHS is in crisis and going backwards? 'How can this be fair when we need to get the deficit down and the Tories are now planning deeper cuts in the next three years than the last five?' Mr Balls said a cut in the top rate to 40p would save someone earning \u00a31 million a year \u00a3340,000 over the course of the next Parliament, while someone with income of \u00a35 million would get a total tax cut of \u00a31.94 million over the five-year period. Meanwhile, he said that unfunded Conservative plans to cut \u00a310 million from income tax by raising thresholds for the 20p and 40p rates would require the equivalent of a two-point rise in VAT, costing an average couple with children \u00a31,440 over four years. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg meets supporters at the Grove Pub while out campaigning in Surbiton, London. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' Voters would not believe Mr Cameron's denial that he intends to increase the consumption tax, because Conservatives had 'a track record of breaking their promises on VAT', he said. However, Conservatives claimed secret Labour plans for tax rises would cost each working family more than \u00a33,000 over the course of the next five years - an estimate which was dismissed as unfounded by independent economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies a week ago. Mr Gauke said: 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband must set out the details of their secret plan for GBP3,028 of tax rises on every working family - the British people have a right to know what these tax hikes are. The choice at this election is clear. Lower taxes under David Cameron. Or higher taxes under Ed Miliband and the SNP.' Mr Balls insisted that Labour will not raise VAT, national insurance or the basic and higher rates of income tax if it wins the general election. But he confirmed that the party would restore the 50p top rate for earnings over \u00a3150,000, as well as imposing a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco companies and closing tax loopholes. Mr Clegg hit out at both sides and warned only his party can ensure a balanced plan to clear the deficit. He said millions of people would get a tax cut worth almost \u00a3400 from a Liberal Democrat pledge to push the income tax personal allowance to \u00a312,500. By contrast, Labour's plan to reintroduce the 10p starter rate of income tax would be worth just \u00a337 to taxpayers. 'Labour's short-term economic plan will lead to mounting borrowing and leave taxpayers short by hundreds of pounds, which is unfair and reckless,' said Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in Kingston-upon-Thames and the South West. 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband's tax plans are economically illiterate. Labour has already failed to commit the \u00a38 billion needed for the NHS, and are now failing to give taxpayers the tax cut they deserve.' Mr Clegg met Elise Popperwell - aged just seven months - and her mother Melissa Popperwell while out campaigning in Surbiton. Mr Balls said: 'All of our plans are fully costed and paid for. None of our manifesto commitments will require a single pound of extra borrowing ... 'So this is the choice at the election, a choice between a Conservative Party which has a track record of breaking their promises on VAT and will raise it again after the election or a Labour Party which has never raised VAT and will not raise VAT in the next Parliament. 'A Tory way which means millions pay more while millionaires pay less, or Labour's plan to back millions of working people, save our NHS and balance the books in a fair way.' Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Ukip leader Nigel Farage was concentrating on his own constituency of South Thanet, where a weekend poll suggested he was trailing in second place in the close three-way marginal. On a campaign visit to Surbiton, south-west London, Mr Clegg said that Liberal Democrats had blocked Tory plans to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 40p during the coalition. Conservative ministers were 'always more interested in tax cuts for people at the top rather than tax cuts for people at the bottom or the middle', Mr Clegg told Sky News. 'I was very amused yesterday to hear George Osborne and David Cameron saying with earnest sincerity that they had no plan of giving further tax cuts to people at the top because, I tell you, they had exactly that plan in government and it was something that we said we would not go along with.' Mr Clegg's comments came after Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told The Independent that during coalition negotiations over tax cuts, a Conservative minister told him: 'You take care of the workers and we'll take care of the bosses.'\n","right_summary":"Labour  unveils poster claiming voters lost \u00a31,100 each due to tax changes.

{"document":"A union secretary has slammed supermarket chain Aldi for trying to overturn workplace laws and gain the right to force employees to work more than 38 hours a week. The Transport Workers' Union's National Secretary Tony Sheldon condemned the requested change to the Fair Work Act and accused Aldi of trying to reintroduce serfdom. 'Major retailers like Aldi are trying to turn the clocks back on our modern society to reintroduce serfdom,' Mr Sheldon in a statement. Aldi has requested the ability to make employees work more than 38 hours in a submission to Workplace Relations Productivity Commission. 'Their model is to keep workers employed on vulnerable part-time and casual basis, increasing and reducing their hours when they see fit.' National Secretary of the Transport Workers' Union, Tony Sheldon, \u00a0accused Aldi of trying to reintroduce serfdom. His comment was made amidst a new submission from the supermarket giant to the Workplace Relations Productivity Commission, in which it recommended that the National Employment Standards be amended to 'enable employers and employees greater flexibility to determine reasonable working hours above the standard 38 hour week'. Aldi's last attempt to increase workers hours in 2012 failed despite the supermarket chain arguing that their employees 'overwhelmingly supported' and 'preferred' the proposals. 'ALDI's experience is that employees are keen for the opportunity of guaranteed additional hours and commensurate income, and prefer this arrangement to a limit of 38 hours plus additional hours to be worked as needed,' David Zalunardo, Aldi's managing director, wrote. However Mr Sheldon argued that the employer had been stopped for good reason, saying the chain had tried to 'strip workers of their rights'. 'The Transport Workers' Union and its members acted against this billion-dollar company in 2012, when it tried to strip workers of their right to refuse to work unreasonably long hours,' he said. Mr Sheldon responded by saying: 'Aldi... believes the right of workers to challenge bad workplace agreements is \"not acceptable in a modern, flexible economy\"' 'Aldi then failed the legal and fairness test, but now in a submission to the Productivity Commission it is seeking again to scrap the same safeguards. 'We can only hope that Aldi's dream for the Australian economy never comes true.' The grocery store also protested union's power to interfere in enterprise agreements, arguing that a recent incident, in which a union representing only 'a very small number of employees' delayed an agreement, caused 'negative consequences\u2026in terms of uncertainty, financial costs and distraction from managing the business'. 'Based on our experience, the length of time taken for FWC consideration of enterprise agreements can be unduly prolonged, costly and disruptive to continuing business operations, which is disadvantageous to all stakeholders. This is not acceptable in a modern, flexible economy,' Mr\u00a0Zalunardo wrote. Mr Sheldon responded by saying: 'Aldi... believes the right of workers to challenge bad workplace agreements is \"not acceptable in a modern, flexible economy\".'\n","right_summary":"Aldi has requested the ability to make\u00a0employees\u00a0work more than 38 hours\u00a0in a\u00a0submission to\u00a0Workplace Relations Productivity Commission.

{"document":"The community has rallied around the family ripped apart by the tragic murder of four-year-old Alistair Mach and his grandmother by the jilted lover of the little boy's grandfather. A fundraising page set up by friends of the family to help pay funeral expenses has raised almost $50,000 in less than a week - more than twice what was expected. Mai Mach, 60, was stabbed 23 times with garden shears in the backyard of her Albanvale home in western Melbourne last Tuesday. Hours earlier her grandson, Alistair, 4, was stabbed 18 times as he slept in his bed. Chinese tourist Cai Xia Liao, 45, has been charged with their murder. A fundraising page to set up to support the families of\u00a0Mai Mach, 60, and her grandson\u00a0Alistair Mach, four, has raised almost $50,000 in less than a week. A MyCause page, set up by family friend Diana Teoh with the goal of raising $20,000 to assist the distraught family with funeral funds, has raised $47,226 so far and continues to gain support. 'It will be used for the funeral and Alastair's parents will direct the remainder of the funds to a good cause,' Ms Teoh told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Teoh added that she did not expect the page to receive so much support and thanked 'all of the kind people' who donated. More than 280 people have donated to the page, with many leaving messages of support. 'Mai will be sadly missed by all at AWTA. She was a model employee for well over 20 years and in that time became a good mate to many of her fellow workers. Rest in peace,' Kelvin Stone wrote.

Supported by Alistair's father Andrew Kwong, his mother Amy Mach held a toy and tiny photo of their only child during the hearing. A dozen other relatives watched Liao from the back of the court. After Liao was charged with murder late on Wednesday night, Detective Leading Senior Constable Tony Harwood told an out-of-sessions court hearing Liao allegedly bound and gagged former lover Brian Mach at his Albanvale home before stabbing Alistair in the head and neck while he lay in bed. A post mortem revealed Alistair, who was regularly babysat by his grandparents, was stabbed 18 times and had tried to defend himself from the attack.

{"document":"Karim Benzema hailed team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo as a 'phenomenon' after the Portuguese struck five goals in Real Madrid's 9-1 mauling of Granada. It was the first time in his career that Ronaldo has scored five goals in a single match and saw him become only the third player to reach the 300-goal mark for Madrid, a tally achieved in only 287 appearances. On Sunday, Benzema said on his club's website: 'Cristiano is a phenomenon, he is always looking for goals and ways to help the team. He deserves everything he has achieved.' Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) scored five goals during Real Madrid's 9-1 La Liga victory against Granada. Benzema also scored twice after Gareth Bale had opening the scoring as Madrid's much-vaunted 'BBC' strikeforce combined to score eight of their side's nine goals, with the other coming from a Diego Mainz own goal. The Frenchman added: 'Him (Ronaldo), Bale and me, we're in good form, like always. We're helping the team and sometimes we score and other times we don't, but we're in good shape to continue like that until the end of the season.' Ronaldo, meanwhile, was quick to highlight the role his team-mates played in his five-goal haul as he inched closer to becoming the club's all-time record scorer. Karim Benzema, who scored twice himself, hailed his Madrid team-mate Ronaldo as a 'phenomenon' Ronaldo performs his trademark celebration as his team-mates watch during the 9-1 rout at the Bernabeu. Raul currently leads the way with 323 goals from 741 appearances while Alfredo di Stefano is second with 308 goals from 396 matches. Ronaldo wrote on Twitter: 'Happy to have scored 5 goals with this excelent team work. Thank you for all your support.' Madrid's performance was a timely one, coming after they had lost three of their previous five matches in La Liga and the Champions League - including a 2-1 loss to bitter rivals Barcelona in their last outing. Sunday's win saw Madrid close the gap to Barca back to one point ahead of the league leaders' clash at Celta Vigo on Sunday evening, and coach Carlo Ancelotti is looking to the future with optimism. Gareth Bale scored for Wales last week and kept up his scoring form with a goal against Granada. He said: 'Everything went to plan. My team are in good physical shape, the players are fresh and we showed that throughout the match. 'We played with a good tempo and scored bags of goals. We come away from this happy but this is just one game and we have other important ones coming up. 'It's simple mathematics. It's better to win nine games 1-0 than one 9-1. But today we have to point out the good play, the team are back to playing as desired, just like they have played many times before. What mattered most was winning and playing well and we have achieved that.' On Ronaldo, the Italian added: 'He has improved just as the team have. So, what can I say...

{"document":"Ed Balls (pictured) said he would not allow Nicola Sturgeon's party to insist on a deal that would see Scotland benefit at the expense of England. Ed Balls has ruled out any post-election pact with the SNP that would put Scotland ahead of England - insisting it would be a 'betrayal of the English vote.' The shadow chancellor said he was 'unequivocal' that he would not allow Nicola Sturgeon's party to dictate a deal at England's expense. Ed Miliband has insisted Labour will not form a coalition with the SNP but has so far stopped short of dismissing a looser arrangement that could prop up a Labour administration. Mr Balls told Wolverhampton's Express and Star newspaper: 'On the SNP point, there is absolutely no possibility of any vote being put to parliament or any budget measure in a Labour budget which would in any way disadvantage the West Midlands or any other part of England, because that's what the SNP demand. 'No way. Unequivocal. I'm not going to do it and Labour won't do it. We've been very clear we won't have a coalition with the SNP and the reason is that the SNP - they can't stand up for the interests of people in England because they want to break up the UK.' He went on: 'Now, we will put a vote to parliament to abolish the bedroom tax. I want a Labour majority to get that through. If the SNP decided to vote against it, that's up to them. 'But the idea that we would ever be in a position where the SNP come along and say, \"we want you to advantage Scotland against the West Midlands in return - in order to win our support\", that would be a betrayal of these constituencies here in the Black Country and the West Midlands, it would be a betrayal of the English vote and we will not do it. Unequivocal.' Yesterday, it was revealed that more than half of Scots plan to back the SNP in the general election, shattering Ed Miliband's hopes of securing a Labour majority. Nicola Sturgeon has been buoyed by a series of TV debates opposing austerity cuts, despite threatening another referendum on independence. A  TNS survey shows the SNP has almost doubled its lead over Labour in a month, with 52 per cent now backing Ms Sturgeon with only 24 per cent of Scots planning to vote for Mr Miliband. The Scottish nationalists\u2019 surge in the polls comes amid signs of a split between Labour leadership in London and Jim Murphy, the Labour leader in Scotland. Mr Murphy has suggested that the party would not need to make \u2018further cuts to achieve our spending rules\u2019 in the next parliament. But yesterday Chuka Umunna, Labour\u2019s business spokesman, slapped him down; telling the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics programme that cuts would have to be made throughout the life of the new parliament. Nicola Sturgeon has offered to work with Labour's Ed Miliband to lock the Tories out of power, even if David Cameron wins more seats on May 7. Ms Sturgeon has offered to work with Labour to lock the Tories out of power, even if David Cameron wins more seats on May 7. But Labour and the SNP have clashed on Ms Sturgeon's call for full fiscal autonomy for Scotland, and her suggestion that another referendum could be held before 2020. In March, Mr Miliband\u00a0flatly ruled out going into coalition with the SNP as he attempted to draw a line under weeks of Tory jibes. The Labour leader insisted there would be no power-sharing deal with Nicola Sturgeon's party and he would not lead a government that included SNP ministers. However, he stopped short of dismissing a looser arrangement that could prop up a Labour administration, such as the 'confidence and supply' agreement. This would essentially see Scottish MPs supporting Labour by helping to get legislation through the Commons.\n","right_summary":"Ed Balls rules out any SNP pact benefiting Scotland at England's expense.

{"document":"What would high fashion adverts look like if the designers used real women, rather than teenage models or celebrity faces, to showcase their latest clothing and beauty lines? Photo stylist Nathalie Croquet, from Paris, has recreated a series of glossy commercials for her project SPOOF. The exhibition includes parodies of ads from Givenchy, Lancome, Lanvin and Acne. In the images Nathalie has recreated the adverts completely, from the clothes the model wears, to the poses, make-up, hair colour and surroundings. Scroll down for video. Lancome: Nathalie Croquet a photo-stylist from Paris created a photo series called SPOOF in which she recreated the ads of famous designers and brands. Natalie said: 'SPOOF is an artistic project of 11 photos, we did an exhibition in February in Paris with my pictures in a big size. 'I had the idea in October and we worked on it for two months. I have worked in the fashion business as a photo stylist for magazines and advertising for 25 years. 'So I am the person who  has ideas for ad campaigns. It was a strange idea for for me to be on the other side of the camera!' During the course of her career Nathalie has worked with over 200 different photographers on various campaigns. ELEVENPARIS: In this image a smiling Nathalie emulates the pose Kate Moss adopted for the French brand. Lanvin: The series of pictures took two months to create and Nathalie said it was interesting to be on the other side of the camera. Nathalie said that the project helped her to understand her job on a deeper level: 'By changing role I discovered my craft from another angle.' She said that she hoped the humour in the images would provide people with the opportunity for, 'laughter and reflection.' She told Buzzfeed: 'I don\u2019t really see myself. You know, like how you don\u2019t recognize your voice in a telephone message?' Eric Bompard: Just like the real life adverts Nathalie's pictures were retouched, for example her eye colour was changed to blue for this Eric Bompard-inspired \u00a0shoot. Acne Studios: Nathalie copied the hair, make-up and poses from the original shots. She continued: 'I feel people need a more spiritual approach to life, and good fun. I\u2019m happy to give them that, even if I\u2019m just making fun of myself.' Daniel\u00a0Schweizer the photographer who shot the images said: 'Most of the time we look at advertising images without analysis, without fully perceiving the extent that they have been worked on. 'Changed clothes and accessories, digital retouching, skin cleansed, faked decor, body stretched; it is only when we take a closer look at these images that we get the full measure. Their apparent simplicity is the result of a huge job.' Isabel Marant: For this shoot only Nathalie's boots were different from those worn by Gisele Bundchen in the real thing. The brazilian supermodel posed on the floor in this black and white  Isabel Marant advert. For the project Nathalie had her hair and make-up professionally styled so that her look completely resembled that of the famous models in the advertising images. Her make-up was done by Cyril Nesmon whilst Rodolphe Farmer styled her hair. And just like the real adverts the images were retouched by Emilie Holtz and worked on by\u00a0Alexandre Plicque-Gurlitt. Sonia Rykiel: Nathalie recreates this shot with a similar looking background to the one used in the original. Voltaire: Nathalie says that she hopes that her pictures will make people laugh and reflect.\n","right_summary":"French stylist Nathalie Croquet stepped in front of the lens for pic project.

Officers say Akon Guode was interviewed as part of the ongoing investigation into the deaths of three children. The children's Sudanese mother, 35, was behind the wheel of a grey 2005 Toyota Kluger when it crashed into the lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west just before 4pm on Wednesday. One-year-old Bol and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger all died after the 4WD they were in plunged into the water. The heartbroken father of three siblings who died has since spoken out to defend the\u00a0children's mother saying she is innocent as she is a 'good mother', the Herald Sun reports. Scroll down for videos. One-year-old Bol (left) and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (right) all died after the 4WD they were in crashed into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west just before 4pm on Wednesday. One mourner hugs Joseph Manyang (fourth from left), the father of three siblings who died, in front of a makeshift shrine at the scene of the crash. Joseph Manyang, the father of the Bol and twins Madit and Anger, said Ms Guode - a mother of seven - \u00a0adored her children. 'She is a very good mother,' he told the Herald Sun. 'She loved the kids. She took care of the kids. I don't think she planned to do anything.' Mr Manyang further said that he believes Ms\u00a0Guode is innocent. This comes as the family of the young girl who survived the tragic crash revealed the five-year-old's condition has improved. A male family member told ABC News little Awel's condition has reduced from critical and she remains in a serious condition at the Royal Children's Hospital. The children's mother, Akorn Manang, was behind the wheel of grey 2005 Toyota Kluger when it plunged into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard. Police have retrieved the four-wheel-drive after it was plunged into the Wyndham Vale on Wednesday. The news comes after the devastated Mr Manyang made an emotional visit to the crash site on Thursday where floral tributes were starting to build up, the\u00a0Herald Sun\u00a0reports. Mr Manyang's 16-year-old niece, Amani Alier, said the family were trying to console him following the devastating news. 'He's shattered, he couldn't stop crying, his nose was bleeding,' she said. 'He just dropped when he saw a picture of his son on the wall. It's so hard for him to deal with. He loved those kids.' Mourners pray at a makeshift shrine at the scene where a 4WD was submerged in Lake Gladman. It follows as the four-wheel-drive was removed from the lake on Thursday afternoon. Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children. The mother, also known as Akon Manaang, moved from South Sudan to Australia in 2008 as a refugee to escape the war there. 'It's a shock for everyone,' Mr Kok said, according to the Herald Sun.\u00a0'We spent all night at hospital until 3 in the morning.' It comes as the tight-knit Sudanese community and nearby residents started leaving floral tributes for the three children. 'As soon as I saw the community coming towards this scene where the incident's happened, it's making me feel like people care,' Mr Kok said. The tight-knit Sudanese community and nearby residents started leaving floral tributes for the three children. The 2005 Toyota Kluger is expected to be removed from the lake late on Thursday morning. The family with seven children moved from South Sudan to Australia in 2008. Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children. Police have confirmed the mother is assisting the homicide squad with their investigation as they appealed for members of the Sudanese community to come forward if they knew anything about what was going on in the family's life. 'We need to understand what led to this, we need to understand the background of this family, we need to understand what was happening in their lives,' Superintendent Stuart Bateson said. 'Hopefully this will lead to a greater understanding of what led to this incident. We appeal especially to the Sudanese community who might know what was happening in this family's life, what their movements were before this tragedy.' A witness Michelle relived the tragic moment the car ploughed into the lake on Thursday morning. 'It is still in my mind now, every time you close your eyes you just see someone so little,' she told Nine News in tears. 'My heart goes out to the family and to everybody who witnessed it. 'Those rescuers, those workers, when it was winding down it was just devastating seeing them sitting in the gutter.' Michelle told 3AW late on Wednesday that her friend Travis rescued one of the young boys from the vehicle. 'Travis jumped into the water and smashed the back windscreen and got one little boy out. (Emergency workers) then started working on the child,' she said. 'I only saw three get taken out. I believe they were travelling down the boulevard...and they've just gone over and into the lake.' Emotions were still raw on Thursday morning for neighbour Michelle who witnessed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger plunging into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard. The search and rescue team remained at the scene to try and pull the car from the water, which is reportedly about 20 to 30 metres from shore. Locals are shocked as to how the car was able to get into the centre of the lake as it is 'pretty far from the road' Detective from the Homicide Squad and the Major Collision Investigation Unit have spoken to some witnesses but they are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. It is not yet know if it was a deliberate act or an accident, according to police. It's believed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger 4WD was travelling towards Pedder St and Minindee Road when the incident occurred.

A mini shrine for the three young children grew on Thursday as families visited the area to pay their respects. Two young girls carried flowers to the lake where three three died when the car they were in crashed. Victoria police said that the exact circumstances of how the car went into the lake are yet to be determined. A resident named Michelle told 3AW that her neighbour broke open the back windscreen of the 4WD to save the children.

A new metro line extension opened this week in the Czech capital \u2013 transporting travellers closer to the airport than ever before \u2013 but the point where passengers transfer from trains to buses doesn\u2019t have a moving staircase. That means porters are left to carry travellers\u2019 heavy bags up and down the steep stairs at Nadrazi Veleslavin station, in north-west Prague, from 5am to 10pm every day, free of charge. Scroll down for video. Porters are carrying passengers' luggage up and down the stairs at\u00a0Nadrazi Veleslavin station every day. The construction project didn't budget for an escalator between the metro station and bus terminal. One of the porters, Radek Mojzis, a 23-year-old student at Prague's School of Economics, told the Associated Press that he applied for the job because he wants \u2018to stay fit and help the elderly.\u2019 Without a direct train connection, the No 119 bus takes passengers on the final five miles between Vaclav Havel Airport and the nearest metro station. More than three million airport customers use the bus every year, choosing not to go by car or risk being ripped off by one of Prague\u2019s notorious cab drivers. The 20billion koruna (\u00a3527million, $787million) metro extension, planned by the Prague Public Transport Company, was supposed to transform Nadrazi Veleslavin station into a transport hub for the airport, with passengers transferring to trains, not buses. Travellers can use a lift, but they are forced to cross a busy road to access the bus terminal. But the project is unfinished and the escalator that was constructed connects with an unbuilt train station. Michal Rehorek, a spokesman for the airport, told MailOnline Travel that the public transit authority is responsible for building a new escalator. He said the airport is in talks with transit officials and a private company regarding the refurbishment of buses that stop at the airport and better signage at the metro station. He added: \u2018Costs for [porters] are in tens of thousands of Czech crowns per month but for Prague Airport it is primarily an investment into the comfort and quality of service rather than cost only.\u2019 Jiri Stabl, a spokesman for the Prague Public Transport Company, told AP that the train project is delayed and \u2018it became impossible\u2019 to change the original plan to include an escalator for those transferring from the metro station to the bus terminal. He added: \u2018We don\u2019t feel it is a mistake of the transport company.\u2019 An escalator was built for airport customers but it connects the metro station and an unbuilt train station. The new extension allows passengers to travel between central Prague and the airport in 30 minutes, including the bus ride. Officials are now considering adding an escalator while it remains unclear when the train project will be completed.

Mike Hand from Haydock in Merseyside became wheelchair bound after being diagnosed with a tumour on his spinal cord. The 39-year-old is almost ready to leave St Helen's Hospital after undergoing surgery and rehabilitation. Mike Hand pictured with his wife Kate, who has been told he can only have a disability grant to adapt his home if his wife gives up work. Mr Hand, left, has been left wheelchair bound after being diagnosed with a tumour on his spine. He now says he needs to make adaptations to his home in Haydock, Merseyside, right. But after he and his wife Kate, who have an eight-year-old daughter called Mia, tried to claim for financial support to adapt their semi-detached home as they have no bathroom downstairs, they were told they weren't eligible. The couple were told that because they don't claim any income support or benefits, they would have to earn 'virtually nothing' to receive the grant. Mrs Hand, a credit manager for a tool hire firm who earns between \u00a325,000 and \u00a335,000, said: 'It's crazy. I understand that benefits need to be means tested and I agree with that. 'But it's not as if we are after ongoing weekly benefits - just funding to help us create a safe and comfortable home for my husband, who has suffered massively through no fault of his own. Mr Hand and his wife\u00a0were told that because they don't claim any income support or benefits, they would have to earn 'virtually nothing' to receive the grant. 'If I gave up work we could claim for everything and would be entitled to everything, but because I work and would like to continue to work, we get no help. 'We're having to rely on my salary alone to support two adults and a child. At the end of the month there's nothing left. 'It's a classic example of the system working against the worker. They're almost forcing us to stop working and claim off the state.' The couple are wanting to adapt their home to incorporate a downstairs bedroom and bathroom. But they say because they are unable to do this, it is placing a strain on the family. Mrs Hand added: 'We live in a normal semi-detached house. We don't have a bathroom or bedroom downstairs and my husband will be expected to spend all of his time in the family living room with very little dignity or privacy.' Mr Hand, a former construction worker, became wheelchair bound after doctors failed to spot a tumour in his spinal column, despite him regularly visiting his GP at Haydock Medical Centre complaining of pain. He was referred to hospital for a CAT scan when only an MRI scan would have picked up the growth, caused by a build up of spinal fluid, which stretched half the length of his spine. Eventually the tumour was detected after he was finally sent for an MRI scan in July 2014, when complaining that while running he felt as though he couldn't lift his feet off the ground. He then underwent a 10-hour operation to remove the tumour as surgeons described his diagnosis as a 'ticking time bomb'. But due to existing nerve damage and the trauma of the operation, he has been left paralysed from the waist down with doctors unable to say if he will ever walk again.

The 25-times-capped centre is now also a doubt for September\u2019s World Cup after undergoing an operation on his left shoulder for the second time in a year. He had played a major role in Edinburgh\u2019s run to the European Challenge Cup semi-final where they play Newport Gwent Dragons at BT Murrayfield on Friday. Scott hasn\u2019t played since picking up his latest injury on Scotland duty against Ireland in the final game of the Six Nations last month. With Glasgow\u2019s Alex Dunbar also a major fitness doubt for the World Cup, Scott\u2019s injury could leave Scotland coach Vern Cotter with a big gap to fill at centre.

Scotland player Matt Scott in action during the RBS Six Nations match between against Ireland at Murrayfield. The Edinburgh medical staff had hoped that Scott\u2019s shoulder would heal naturally but have decided further surgery is required as there has been no improvement over the last three weeks. A club spokeswoman said: \u2018It had been hoped that Matt would be able to manage his injury but, following consultation with specialists at Spire Murrayfield Hospital, the decision to perform an investigative arthroscopy was taken. \u2018This resulted in him requiring a further surgical procedure to help deal with his shoulder complaints. \u2018Matt will continue his rehabilitation programme with the Edinburgh Rugby medical team and won\u2019t play again this season.\u2019 Scott was putting a brave face on having his season cut short by this latest injury blow. In a tweet, the Scotland and Edinburgh centre said: \u2018Gutted that my season is over already after getting surgery. \u2018Brings an end to a frustrating year for me but positive about next few months.\u2019 Edinburgh are short of cover in the centre positions and will now rely on New Zealander Phil Burleigh and South African Andries Strauss \u2014 who both started in the quarter-final away win over London Irish in the absence of Scott \u2014 from now until the end of the season. Scott went under the knife last week but he has now been told he will have to be operated on again. Kiwi Sam Beard is the only other experienced centre at the club. To add to their woes, Edinburgh also have a major doubt over David Denton, who was forced off with a head knock in the 34-3 Pro12 loss to Munster on Saturday. Denton is following return-to-play protocols and a late decision on the back-row forward\u2019s fitness will be taken. Without Scott and possibly Denton, Edinburgh will be less confident of overcoming the Dragons on Friday and reaching the Challenge Cup Final, where they would play Gloucester or Exeter. Like Edinburgh, the Dragons may be in the lower half of the table, but they are in a rich vein of form and have won three matches in a row. Their latest and biggest scalp was taken last weekend when they overcame Leinster 25-22 in the Pro12. Hooker Ross Ford is desperate to defeat the Welsh and keep alive his dream of being part of the first Scottish professional club side to lift silverware. The Scotland international has managed just 14 games for club and country in the past year. Ford is one of seven survivors from the Edinburgh team that lost 22-19 in the Heineken Cup semi-final against Ulster three years ago. But the hooker insists reaching the European Challenge Cup Final at Twickenham Stoop on May 1 would overtake even that 2012 highlight. \u2018I have been at Edinburgh through many ups and downs, so to win the Challenge Cup would be my biggest achievement,\u2019 said 85-times-capped Ford. \u2018It would also be a massive boost and something the club could take confidence from and build on in future seasons. It wouldn\u2019t just be good for us, but also for Scottish rugby. \u2018We didn\u2019t have a good Six Nations in terms of results and it would be a great boost to the game in Scotland if we manage to get to the final and win it.\u2019 Ford insists Edinburgh have already forgotten that embarrassing home defeat to Munster and believes confidence remains high ahead of Friday\u2019s match. \u2018This is a European Challenge Cup semi-final and we will all be up for it,\u2019 said the 30-year-old former Scotland captain. \u2018We weren\u2019t at our best against Munster but we will be fixing what went wrong in training this week. \u2018What we have in our favour is home advantage and we can expect a big crowd who will give is us a lot of backing. \u2018I have detected an excitement among our fans about the European game and our whole Challenge Cup campaign.\u2019\n","right_summary":"Centre Matt Scott will miss the rest of the season because of injury.

{"document":"Burying the dead along with a human sacrifice was common in ancient Korea. But an unusual tomb dating to between the 5th and 6th century seems to hold the remains of two lovers, one of whom may have been killed so the pair could lie together for eternity. The skeletons were found on top of one another in the tomb from Korea\u2019s Silla Dynasty, leading some experts suggesting that the set-up could even have been designed to show two people having sex. An unusual tomb dating to between the 5th and 6th century seems to hold the remains of two lovers, one of whom may have been killed so the pair could lie together for eternity. Here, the bones of the two people can be seen on top of one another, leading some experts to suggest the set-up was designed to imitate sex. Archaeologists are almost certain that the tomb was intended for a noblewoman and believe that the man she is lying with may have been killed so he could be buried with her. The tomb is made of soil and stone and was discovered last December in Hwangnam-dong, a neighbourhood of Gyeongju City in South Korea,Korea Joongang Daily reported. It was the capital of ancient Silla for almost 1,000 years and is known for its intricate gold ornaments and Buddhist temples. The remains of the two people, including leg bones and teeth, were found in the main chamber of the tomb and are thought to have died between the ages of 20 and 30. Experts believe the tomb was intended for the woman, because her body is carefully positioned to face the sky and she was buried with gold earrings, indicating her high status. A belt, beaded necklace and jade green jewels were also found with her skeleton. It is not known whether she died naturally or was killed. Archaeologists are almost certain that the tomb was intended for a noblewoman and believe that the man she is lying with may have been killed so he could be buried with her. The position of the skeletons is shown above. It's thought that the tomb was intended for a noblewoman, based on the positioning of her skeleton and objects found with her body, such as gold earrings (pictured). In contrast, no precious possessions were found with the male body, leading experts to speculate that he was a human sacrifice and possibly, her lover. Both the woman and the man in the tomb are estimated to be between the ages of 20 and 30 when they died, or were killed. The woman is thought to have been a noblewoman, based on the fact that her body was positioned on its back in the tomb, and she was buried with precious items such as gold earrings and jade. A sword and horse harness was discovered in another room of the tomb, indicating she was used to riding a horse and carrying a weapon, which was not unusual during the Silla Dynasty, which sometimes had women rulers. The man would have been the woman's lover, servant or body guard and it is likely that he was killed to be buried with her. Human sacrifices were buried in tombs at the time so they could act as guards in the afterlife. But when males were killed, they were usually placed at the feet of the person whom the tomb was intended for, or outside the main chamber, indicating that the man was of special interest to the noblewoman. The fact that the bones lie on top of each other have  led experts to think that the couple were lovers. Some even say that their bodies were positioned to make it look like they were having sex. In contrast, the man is believed to be a human sacrifice and his bones are positioned on top of hers. While male sacrifices were rare but not unheard of at the time, the set up in tomb is thought to be unique. Silla history expert, Professor Lee Han-sang of Daejeon University, told\u00a0The Chosun Ilbo: \u2018The man could have been a servant, bodyguard or lover\u2019. \u2018The discovery is important because it shows an unknown type of burial of the living with the dead in the Silla period.\u2019 Kim Kwon-il, a researcher at The Foundation of Silla Cultural Heritage Research, said: \u2018Male sacrifices were often buried in the room where the artefacts were, as guards, so to speak, for the dead.\u2019 In the Silla tomb, the position of the teeth indicate that the man and woman\u2019s heads laid next to each other. The only bodies previously found in main chambers, show that human sacrifices were often positioned at the feet of the person whom the tomb was intended for. Some historians believe that the couple were deliberately arranged to make it look as if they were having sex, Yonhap News Agency reported. The man\u2019s thigh bones were found on top of the woman\u2019s, indicating that they could have been locked in an embrace when they were buried. However, researchers at the foundation say that t's more likely that the man may have been buried on a wooden frame above her body, which decayed over time, so his bones became mingled with hers. Explicit clay dolls with large penises or breasts have previously been found and belong to the Silla, supporting some claims that the burial could have been posed to look sexual. In another room of the tomb, artefacts including a sword, harness and pottery was recovered, indicating that the woman probably rode horses and carried a weapon. No artefacts linked to the man were found, reinforcing the belief he was a sacrifice. Tombs from the early part of the Silla Dynasty are rare and just 24 are known to have been discovered. The tomb is made of soil and stone and was discovered in Hwangnam-dong (shown on the map with a red marker), a neighbourhood of Gyeongju City in South Korea, last December.\n","right_summary":"Remains dating to the 5th century were found in tomb in Hwangnam-dong. Show a man's bones on top of a woman's who was buried with jewellery. Experts believe Silla Dynasty-era tomb was built for a noblewoman and her lover or bodyguard was\u00a0sacrificed\u00a0and buried on top of her. There's a suggestion that the set-up may have been designed to show two people having sex - and the Silla were known for their explicit pottery.\n","hallucinated_summary":"An ancient Korean tomb has been found with the remains of a couple who may have been lovers, even though only the female was buried with precious items.

Silla-era tombs were mostly used for guarding the dead in the afterlife, and some historians have said that the position of the bones in the Hwangnam-dong tomb may indicate that they were embracing. The explicit pottery and artifacts found in another room of the tomb only reinforce this idea."}
{"document":"Ronny Deila bemoaned the refereeing blunder which cost ten-man Celtic side a crack at a rare domestic treble. Virgil van Dijk's sublime 16th free-kick gave the Parkhead side a dream start to their Scottish Cup semi-final clash with Inverness. But the Parkhead side were denied a clear penalty and the chance to go 2-0 ahead before half-time when additional assistant Alan Muir failed to spot a goalline handball from Josh Meekings. Ronny Deila was angry at the referee's decision to now send off Josh Meekings and award his side a penalty. Celtic's anger was further fuelled when McLean - rightly - sent off Parkhead keeper Craig Gordon for clattering into Marley Watkins in 53 minutes, Greg Tansey equalising from the spot. A man down for 67 minutes the Scottish champions wilted in extra-time, succumbing to goals from Edward Ofore and David Raven, despite John Guidetti making it 2-2. In measured tones, Deila chose his reaction to the penalty furore carefully saying: 'I don't think I have to say much about that. 'I think everybody can see what's happening. The Inverness defender (6) handled Leigh Griffiths goal-bound header but none of the officials saw it. 'When they played with 11 v 11 we had good control of the game and produced good chances and enough to win the game. 'But, of course, with ten it gets more difficult and we have to run more. 'And, again, we got very tired.' Pinning the blame for the incident on the unsighted additional assistant Muir rather than referee MacLean the Norwegian added: 'We have five referees, maybe we need seven \u2013 I don't know. One on each post. The Celtic boss remonstrated with Steven McLean at half-time and was angry at the poor decision. 'He has one task. He has to look at something on the goalline. 'You can't blame the main referee for that.' Asked if it was a big, critical moment in the game he added: 'I don't think. Everybody knows that. 'The game is finished if we get it. 'That's a tough day. Hard to take of course. Inverness' players celebrate at the final whistle after reaching the Scottish Cup final after extra time. 'I think we fought very hard. When you don't get the result you want of course it's a blow for us.' The Meekings incident, the latest in a wretched season for Scottish referees, will reopen the debate surrounding television replays. 'This will not help anything today,' said Deila, dismissing the idea. 'It's very hard for me to discuss this. 'It's a big blow for the boys. I'm very disappointed. 'We had control, eleven v eleven and should have killed the game before. Virgil van Dijk (left) had given Celtic the lead and put his side in control before all the incidents kicked off. 'We didn't do it and put ourselves in very sad situation. 'But Inverness are a good football team. I also have to congratulate them. They have had a good season and if they get a title it will be even better, so that's very good.' Insisting he had no issues over the red card for Gordon which forced him to remove the dangerous James Forrest and put Lukasz Zaluska in goals Deila vowed to lift his shatteted players for Wednesday's trip to Dundee on league business. Currently leading Aberdeen by five points with a game in hand he insisted: 'We have to move on. We still have a lot to fight for. Craig Gordon (left) was rightly sent off by the referee for fouling Marley Watkins when he went through. 'The league title is still the most important thing. We have to get back on track. 'Good teams bounce back quickly. Now on Wednesday we have to be back on track, and that's what we're aiming for. 'Everybody is very disappointed today. But I have had disappointing moments before in football. It's about how you handle it and what you learn from it. We've done a lot of good things so far and if we win the league as well we'll have had a good season. So we have a lot to build on. 'We just have to move on. Today I understand we can be a little bit disappointed, and the supporters of course, but we have to come together from tomorrow and really focus on Wednesday.'\n","right_summary":"Ronny Deila was angry at the referee's decision to not award his side a penalty and send off Josh Meekings for a handball on the goal line.

{"document":"It may have taken 170 minutes to come but super sub Yevhen Shakhov earned Dnipro a place in the Europa League semi-finals after breaking Brugge hearts with a late winner on Thursday night. The midfielder latched on to a Ruslan Rotan pass as the Ukrainian's hit on the counter attack to settle a tie that looked to be heading for extra-time after last week's goalless draw in Belgium. The Belgian league leaders set the record for most Europa League games unbeaten after the stalemate took them to 11 without loss since the opening game of the group stage earlier this season. Yevhen Shakhov broke the deadlock in the final 10 minutes with a left-footed drive that took a slight deflection. Australia goalkeeper Mathew Ryan can do nothing to stop\u00a0Shakhov's effort finding the net. Shakhov leads the celebrations after netting the winner for Dnipro to book a Europa League semi-final place. But their European dream came crashing down at the\u00a0at the Dnipro-Arena during an evening that offered little in the way of quality. The visitors started the game brightly as Davy De fauw and Nikola Storm combined to good effect down the right but, after carving the Brugge defence open, could only win a corner. But the Ukraine outfit soon settled into the game and took control of proceedings. Yheven Konoplyanka, perennially linked with a move to the Premier League was a constant threat down the Dnipro left. First he weaved his way into the penalty area with a jinking run but was eventually crowded out before the Ukraine international test Brugge keeper Mathew Ryan with the first meaningful effort of the match. Dnipro midfielder Shakhov slides to his knees in celebration after earning his side a place in the last four. The Dnipro players mob the goalscorer as his effort sends them into the Europa League semi-finals. Dnipro (4-2-3-1): Boyko, Douglas, Luchkevych (Bruno Gama 90+1), Fedetskiy, Kankava, Leo Matos, Cheberyachko, Bezus (Shakhov 46), Rotan, Konoplyanka, Seleznyov\u00a0(Kalinic 72) Subs not used:\u00a0Lastuvka, Vlad, Svatok, Blyznychenko. Scorer(s):\u00a0Shakhov 82. Booked: Rotan, Kankava. Manager:\u00a0Myron Markevych. Brugge (4-3-3): Ryan, De Fauw, Duarte, De Bock, Mechele, Simons, Refaelov, Vormer, De Sutter (Oulare 70), Izquierdo (Dierckx 86), Storm\u00a0(Vazquez 86) Subs not used:\u00a0Kujovic, Van den Buijs, Silva, Coopman. Booked: Oulare. Manager:\u00a0Michel Preud'homme. Referee:\u00a0Alberto Undiano Mallenco (ESP) The winger unleashed a well struck free kick from all of 30 yards, but the effort was straight at the Australia No 1. The home side pressed for an opener as Konoplyanka continued to cause the Brugge backline problems as the winger tormented the right-hand side of the Brugge defence. And Dnipro could have been in front on the half-hour mark but Yevhen Seleznyov fired off target after being picked out in the area by Roman Bezus. The Ukrainians were almost gifted an opening goal moments before half-time after a miscommunication between Ryan and defender Brandon Mechele that had manager Michel Preud\u2019homme shaking his head in disbelief. Just minutes after the restart Dnipro again came close to breaking the deadlock. This time it was Konoplyanka who, after collecting Rotan's brilliant ball over the top, fired an effort agonisingly wide of the far post. Brugge continued to defend for their lives as the visitors seemed intent on preserving their unbeaten record in the competition this season. The dangerous\u00a0Yevhen Konoplyanka shields his face as he flies into a challenge with\u00a0Ruud Vormer. Dnipro forward Roman Bezus vies for the ball with Ruud Vormer during the quarter-final clash. In a rare foray into the final third substitute Obbi Oulare let fly with a 30-yard strike that narrowly missed the target as the game looked to be heading for an extra 30 minutes. Brugge began to take more opportunities as the game neared the final 15 minutes, and it proved their undoing. Dnipro broke swiftly and Rotan released Shakhov, a half-time substitute, who cut in on his left foot and beat Ryan courtesy of a slight deflection. Brugge made a late double change in a bid salvage their place in the competition but it was too little, too late as Dnipro Europa League dream continues.\n","right_summary":"Dnipro beat Brugge 1-0 in Ukraine to earn place in Europa League last four. Yevhen Shakhov scored the tie's only goal in the 82nd minute on Thursday. The first leg between the two sides finished goalless in Belgium last week.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Yevhen Shakhov's left-footed strike in the final seconds of the Europa League quarter-final match gave Dnipro a 2-1 victory over Brugge, crushing the Belgian team's dreams of a place in the semi-finals.

{"document":"Looking after a newborn baby is one of the most exhausting periods in a woman's life. You haven't recovered from giving birth and are suddenly on duty 24\/7, responsible for entertaining, feeding and cleaning an unstoppable machine. On top of this, the mothers have to deal with the never-ending conveyor belt of friends and family who are desperate to see the new addition. Looking after a newborn is one of the most exhausting periods in life (picture posed by model) Well-meaning visitors arrive at the house armed with gifts for the baby and plenty of compliments. But while they might be well-intentioned, there are a number of pitfalls to be avoided when cooing over a newborn. Parenting blogger\u00a0Emily-Jane Clark, who runs the popular site\u00a0How to Survive a Sleep Thief, which she describes as\u00a0'an antithesis to baby advice',\u00a0has compiled a list of the ways that visitors can avoid annoying a new mother. They include bringing gifts for the mum and coming armed with chocolate and coffee - read on to find out more... New mothers receive plenty of visitors shorty after giving birth, who often have annoying habits\u00a0(picture posed by model) 1. DO NOT arrive unannounced to \u2018give us a break from the baby\u2019. Emily-Jane says: 'We have known our child for two days. We do not need a break from her just yet. 'Give me a week or two and no doubt I\u2019ll be begging for you to take her off my hands!' 2. DO buy presents for ME! Not for the baby. Emily-Jane says: 'I\u2019m the one with the stitched up lady bits who did all the hard work. My daughter has spent the past ten months sitting on her arse. My need for gifts is greater than hers. 'Besides, all she cares about right now is milky breasts. So unless you can supply some of those then you really needn\u2019t bother. 'And what\u2019s with all the muslins? In no other situation would it be deemed acceptable to buy someone just out of hospital cleaning cloths as a  present. Not to mention the ultimate insult. I can barely bring myself to type the words. NON-alcoholic \u2018champagne\u2019. Sparkling bloody grape juice! 'I have just endured ten months of pregnancy and hours of labour. Do you not think I might need a proper drink? Sure, I am breastfeeding, but I can still have one glass (yes, I checked, by god, did I check).' Mothers are often on the brink of exhaustion when looking after a newborn\u00a0(picture posed by model) 3. DO wash your hands before you touch my baby. Emily-Jane says: 'You may think you have clean hands until you meet the first time mother of a newborn. 'The brand new mum is highly adept in detecting dirt invisible to the naked eye. She is well aware that on every square centimetre of your hand there are 1,500 bacteria. 'And the moment you touch her baby\u2019s face or, god forbid, let the baby suck your finger (why?) \u2013 she can see all 50,000 of those germy little tossers wriggling off your hand and into her baby\u2019s brand new little mouth.' 4. DO give support not advice. Emily-Jane says: 'I might tell you I am finding motherhood tough. I may say I feel out of my depth. But do not take this to mean I need you to tell me how to feed\/hold\/change my baby. 'Thanks to the Internet, parenting books and the NHS, my head is filled with so much advice that I am already struggling to listen to my maternal instincts. 'So offer a shoulder to cry on, or a sympathetic ear, but please, no unsolicited advice.' Mothers often get a stream of visitors in the months after giving birth\u00a0(picture posed by model) 5. DO NOT tell me that my baby looks just like her father. Emily-Jane says: 'She doesn\u2019t. She currently looks like a wrinkly, blotchy newborn. Seriously, if my husband really did look like a two-day-old baby I don\u2019t think I would have married him.' 6. DO NOT gender stereo-type my child. Emily-Jane says: 'Just because I have a girlbaby it does not mean I want to dress her up like a princess or fill her room with princesses. 7. DO NOT enter my home unless you are armed with coffee and or\/chocolate. 8. DO NOT ask me questions about the future. Emily-Jane says: 'Will you be getting her christened? When will she go in her own room? Will you be going to the NCT baby group? Where will she go to school? 'Right now, I can barely work out what I am doing tomorrow, let alone in three years\u2019 time.'\n","right_summary":"Looking after a newborn\u00a0is one of the most exhausting periods in life.

{"document":"Young professional footballers can be an easy target with some of their behaviour but on Thursday afternoon it was refreshing to sit down and talk with Danny Welbeck. He struck me as a thoroughly decent young man who lives his life the right way. He is a credit to his family and his easy-going manner means he must a dream to work with. We discussed life at Arsenal, scoring against Manchester United and his FA Cup dreams. You can watch the full interview on Football Focus on BBC One today at 12.10pm and Reading\u2019s semi-final with Arsenal live on BBC One from 5.05pm. Danny Welbeck talks to Sportsmail's Martin Keown ahead of Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final against Reading. MARTIN KEOWN: You\u2019ve played at Wembley many times and you\u2019ve played in a semi-final as well but you\u2019re now one step away from an FA Cup final. Does that bring extra nerves? DANNY WELBECK:\u00a0Not really. I think we\u2019ve basically just got to play the game, not the occasion. The team was in this position last year and coming up against Wigan proved to be one of the toughest games of the season. Against Reading today is going to be another tough game. We\u2019ve just got to approach it the right way and we want to get through to the final. Welbeck expects a tough test as Arsenal face a Championship side at Wembley for the second year in a row. KEOWN: How are you settling in? You seem to have been here all your life almost and you\u2019ve only been here seven or eight months. WELBECK:\u00a0The staff at the club, at the training ground and everyone has been very welcoming. The fans have been brilliant. My team-mates are class and I\u2019m just really enjoying my time here. I\u2019ve settled in very well. It\u2019s a transitional year for me, getting to know new players, new team-mates, new systems and new ways of going about things at a different club. I think I\u2019ve put in a few good performances. I\u2019ve been unlucky on the club front with goals and that\u2019s something I know will come in abundance when I get to know everything spot on with the club and I\u2019m pretty sure that will happen. The Arsenal striker thinks he has been unlucky in front of goal, but wants to play in a more central role. KEOWN: You talk about goals, you\u2019re playing in a wide position. What\u2019s your favourite position? WELBECK: It\u2019s no secret I prefer to play down the middle. But the formation we play at Arsenal, you\u2019re playing on the left or the right. We\u2019re always interchanging, playing in a three-man attack. It\u2019s much easier doing that than playing left midfield or left wing in a four-man midfield. KEOWN: Wenger has worked with lots of strikers over the years and been able to develop them. What\u2019s the area that he\u2019s working on most with you most of all? WELBECK: We talk about the game, we analyse performances and on the training pitch we\u2019ve also got the other staff here so after training we do a bit of individual work so that happens every day. You are always looking at ways to improve as a player, to develop and I feel like I am developing well as a player. Welbeck, who says he has been made to feel very welcome at Arsenal, holds of Nacho Monreal in training. KEOWN: Is it your movement he works on? Is it holding up the ball? Finishing? Or is it a combination? WELBECK: It\u2019s a combination of everything. You don\u2019t just work on one thing. Every single day all the lads after training go out and do finishing. KEOWN: Does that become competitive? To see who can score the most goals? WELBECK: Yeah it does! It gets competitive but it\u2019s obviously all fun. But at the end of the day nobody wants to come last. We work on a lot of areas of our game. Like his team-mate Theo Walcott, Welbeck is often forced out wide, despite preferring being a central striker. KEOWN: In the last round you put out Manchester United. How did it feel to score at Old Trafford? WELBECK: It was a weird occasion for me going to back to Old Trafford on the away side. The weirdest thing was warming up on the other side of the pitch. It just felt a bit weird. But you have to treat it like it\u2019s any other game and play the game, not the occasion. Obviously I was going back to a club that brought me up and going back to the fans that supported me for years, playing against old team-mates, my old friends, it was a weird occasion. But I scored the goal, a big goal to get us through to the semi-final. So it was a spur of the moment to celebrate. The English international scored the winning goal on his return to Old Trafford in the quarter finals last month. KEOWN: Did it cross your mind not to celebrate? WELBECK:\u00a0Leading up to the game I had no plans whatsoever. I just wanted to play the game, get it over and done with and get through to Wembley and get to the semi-final. That\u2019s what happened. I scored the goal and whatever I did I would have been criticised \u2013 criticised if I celebrated or criticised if I didn\u2019t. It was just spur of the moment. KEOWN: Against Manchester United you seemed extra motivated. Was it anything to do with Louis Van Gaal\u2019s comments before the match? WELBECK:\u00a0I didn\u2019t see the comments. Going into every game I want to be motivated. Playing against Manchester United \u2013 I did it earlier in the season at the Emirates \u2013 and then it was a bit different this time going back to Old Trafford. There was motivation there but I\u2019m motivated in every game. I want to do well for my team, try and win the game and in that case get through to the semi-final. Listen, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, some you like, some you don\u2019t like but that\u2019s just football and it\u2019s life. You deal with it. Welbeck celebrates in front of his old fans, a decision he says was entirely spur of the moment. KEOWN: I think you showed a lot of mental strength going into that situation. It\u2019s always difficult going back. WELBECK:\u00a0You\u2019ve got to be strong mentally living the life and being a professional footballer. There\u2019s a lot of people out to get you and whatever you do, everyone\u2019s watching. You\u2019ve just got to be switched on 100 per cent of the time. That\u2019s just the way I\u2019ve been brought up. My parents are lovely, caring people and they look after me well, they brought me up well and it\u2019s the same with me and my brothers that\u2019s credit to them. The striker has quickly become a favourite at the Emirates, and he thanked the fans for their support. KEOWN: This weekend it\u2019s Reading. Have you looked much at their team? WELBECK:\u00a0You get to watch a few games throughout the season. I know they\u2019ve got players with Premier League experience. I\u2019ve seen them a couple of games this season being a bit direct. [Pavel] Pogrebnyak\u2019s a player they look for quite often from the back and the wingers will be coming inside to get the ball and flick-ons. Hal Robson-Kanu plays a bit more inside and [Gareth] McCleary is a bit more out and out on the right wing. Welbeck has been working hard in training to try and improve his finishing, along with his team-mates. KEOWN: Good knowledge\u2026. WELBECK: Yeah I know quite a lot about football! KEOWN: As a centre forward or a winger, do you look for the weaknesses in the opposition? WELBECK: You\u2019ve got to analyse the positives and negatives in every single team. You look at that and obviously see where you can nullify their attack and see where their weaknesses are at the back. The Gunners forward picked out Pavel Pogrebnyak as one of Reading's most dangerous players. KEOWN: How much would it mean to you to get to the FA Cup final? WELBECK:\u00a0It would mean a lot. I\u2019ve been in this position before with Man United when we played Everton in the semi-finals a few years back and we lost on penalties. I remember the situation, I remember how I felt that day and that\u2019s something I don\u2019t want to feel again. I just want to get to the next stage, get to the final. This is a very important game so we\u2019re all looking forward to it, we\u2019re going to approach it like it\u2019s any other and play the game not the occasion.\n","right_summary":"Danny Welbeck met up with Sportsmail's Martin Keown.

{"document":"A young mother is desperately trying to raise money for an expensive cancer treatment which could buy her more time with her family. Louisa Steckenreuter, 35, a mother to two young children,  Darcy, 13, and  Tilda, 2, was diagnosed with\u00a0Osteosarcoma, a rare form of cancer last year. Now to have a chance at accessing potentially life-saving treatment the woman from Dulwich Hill, in Sydney's inner-west, needs to raise $100,000. 'What we\u2019re hoping is that it gives me longer to spend time with my kids and watch them grow up. And grow old with husband like we had planned' Louisa Steckenreuter is desperately trying to raise money for an expensive cancer treatment which could buy her more time with her family. 'I was diagnosed on the 23rd of June last year,' Ms\u00a0Steckenreuter told Daily Mail Australia. 'I had pain my shoulder, I sort of regularly had muscle pain in my neck and shoulder anyway but then it just got incredibly intense and for a while they thought it was something called a shoulder impingement,' she continued. 'Then they did an x-ray and saw that the bone was very unhealthy and they did a biopsy and found out it was cancer.' Since then the mother-of-two has undergone eight rounds of intravenous chemotherapy, which while it helped also made her very unwell. 'My oncologist has recommended I try this new drug. It\u2019s called Keytruda',\u00a0Ms Steckenreuter said. It works differently to chemotherapy, which attacks all the cells in the system, even healthy ones. Ms Steckenreuter, 35, a mother to two young children, Darcy, 13, and Tilda, 2, was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma, a rare form of cancer last year. The mum-of-two was diagnosed after she went in for an x-ray on a sore shoulder. 'I was diagnosed on the 23rd of June last year,' Ms Steckenreuter told Daily Mail Australia. 'Whereas the Keytruda works with your body\u2019s immune system and recognises the fact that the body\u2019s immune system is able to fight the cancer cells if they realise the cells are bad,' Ms\u00a0Steckenreuter explained. However the drawback is the medication costs $6000 a month, and is not subsidised on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is usually used to treat patients with advanced melanomas. Since the diagnosis she has undergone eight rounds of intravenous chemotherapy, which while it helped also made her very unwell. Ms Steckenreuter turned to a new drug,\u00a0Keytruda, to help fight off the deadly disease. Her doctors believe it may help her. Ms Steckenreuter said her oncologist,\u00a0Professor David Thomas, said he believes the treatment might work for her, and others in a similar situation . 'The reason he thinks it will work is that sarcoma and melanoma cancer cells are built in a similar way and respond in a similar way,' she said. 'What we\u2019re hoping is that it gives me longer to spend time with my kids and watch them grow up. 'And grow old with husband like we had planned,' Ms\u00a0Steckenreuter said. 'The reason he thinks it will work is that sarcoma and melanoma cancer cells are built in a similar way and respond in a similar way,' she said. Louisa and her husband, Andre, were married in 2010. The mother-of-two said at first she was hesitant to ask for donations, but by putting herself out there as the first Australian to try this drug for her type of cancer she might help others.

She broke down in tears when told about the donation, and vowed to find out who the generous person was so she could thank them. The Sydney woman isn't quite halfway to her $100,000 target and has so far raised $48,670, but needs more so she can try this drug which has a good chance of buying her more time.

{"document":"Protecting the FA Cup prize money is the biggest reason the FA is prepared to give away what amounts to almost title sponsorship of the tournament to Emirates Airlines. The proposed \u00a330million, three-year contract for an Emirates FA Cup, revealed by Sports Agenda, gives the FA the resources to ensure the monies received by the clubs for progressing in the world\u2019s most famous club knockout tournament. The figures range from \u00a31,150 for winning the extra preliminary round through to the \u00a31.8million either Aston Villa or Arsenal \u2014 on a par with the Wimbledon singles champions \u2014 will receive for lifting the trophy on May 30.

{"document":"London (CNN)It wasn't messrs Clooney, Pitt and their nine accomplices who sailed down an elevator shaft and cracked open dozens of safety deposit boxes at a London vault during the Easter weekend. But last weekend's raid in the heart of the city's jewelry  district feels like it has been taken from a movie like \"Ocean 11\" given its daring and planning. Such robberies are rare: the gang didn't follow the current criminal trend of manipulating digits in cyber space but instead went back to basics and committed their burglary in a way not seen in London for more than 40 years. In September 1971, the staff of a bank in Baker Street, central London, arrived at work to find that thieves had dug a 40-yard tunnel from a shop they had rented, hauled in a thermic lance and explosives and opened the strong room. The gang got away with a haul worth around \u00a330 million (the incident later formed the basis of the movie \"The Bank Job.\") But how are such heists organized? Roy Ramm, a former commander of specialist operations at London's Scotland Yard for 27 years, explains. In the UK burglaries and robberies are often committed by working-class people, people who would otherwise have blue collar jobs. In more than 25 years as a Scotland Yard detective, I never met a Raffles- or a Thomas Crown-style criminal from a middle-class background who had then turned to the hard side of crime. Sophisticated heists like the Hatton Garden raid are generally not a natural progression for burglars who began with smaller domestic break-ins. Many neighborhood criminals commit burglaries to feed drugs habits and acquire long strings of convictions that mean they are always on the police radar.  Occasionally, they steal things they can't sell and end up dumping valuable paintings or antiques when they are not able to sell them on quickly. More specialist criminals -- those, for example, who target museums or country houses -- will be very specific and steal only what they know they can quickly convert to untraceable cash. Many of those who commit the bigger crimes or run major criminal enterprises combine high IQs with a kind of raw street intelligence. One of their skills is the ability to recognize a criminal opportunity when it presents itself, possibly from a source of inside information. Probably the biggest difference between any heist you'll see in a movie and its real-life equivalent is the motive. I've never encountered any criminal who committed a high value crime just for the challenge or to prove that it could be done. The only reason has been for the money, often to support a certain lifestyle and to fund other criminal enterprises. Inside information is one way of identifying a criminal opportunity, using people who are able to provide that crucial detail or who will participate in some small way to facilitate the crime. The Brinks MAT robbery in 1983 -- a case which I was involved in at the time -- saw a criminal gang escape with gold bullion worth more than \u00a328 million (around \u00a388 million -- or $130million -- adjusting for inflation) from a warehouse at London's Heathrow Airport. The Knightsbridge safety deposit robbery of 1987 saw a gang make off with tens of millions of pounds in cash and valuables from an upscale London neighbourhood (the true amount will never be known). Both were made possible by inside information: it's an angle that London detectives investigating last weekend's heist will be looking at very closely. The planning behind the Hatton Garden raid will have been meticulous. The target will have been observed, perhaps for months, and the thieves will have decided on the right time to commit the crime.  A long weekend or a public holiday are occasions when more time may be available, also perhaps when regular staff are away. Sometimes the mastermind behind the raid will need a larger team of criminals to do a specific job. Usually they will already be known directly to each other, perhaps because they worked on other jobs together. Possibly a specialist can be brought in by another team member -- but they have to be able to trust each other and trust comes from understanding, so gangs in the UK tend to come from the same social and ethnic group, maybe even limited to one relatively small geographic area. Even though there is more diversity in society, it would be unusual to find a broad ethnic or social mix in the team put together for a major crime. Vehicles will have been obtained, stolen or purchased for cash and their identities cloned or changed. Equipment will have been sourced. Everything will have been cleaned, cleaned and cleaned again to remove forensic traces. They will plan routes that avoid CCTV and timings that attract the least attention. They will have untraceable disposable phones and an outside team to warn the inside men of any problems. They will have planned their getaway, their clean-up and how and when they are going to dispose of anything that might link them to the crime scene -- and of course how they are going to sell on the proceeds of their crime. What criminals steal doesn't vary that much. Cash is probably first choice, followed by anything that can quickly and easily be converted to cash, like gold, jewellery and watches. The conversion of stolen goods to cash is risky and expensive: the Brinks MAT bullion that was traced was because it had been clumsily smelted and then sold on. Fine paintings and rare antiques are less desirable for experienced criminals -- unless they are stealing to order -- because they are so identifiable and because the black market is so much smaller. A painting may sell at an international auction for millions of dollars but it will only fetch a fraction of its true value from a dishonest collector. London detectives investigating the Hatton Garden heist will be looking very closely at the possibility of inside involvement. But police enquiries won't stop there. They will look at every aspect of how the target business operates, then try to think like criminals to identify the weaknesses in physical and operational security that the gang may have been informed about or else spotted and then exploited. The forensic assault on the crime scene will be immense. In recent years forensic science has made major advances in identifying trace evidence and investigators will look for any scrap of evidence that might yield the DNA of a criminal. CCTV footage from street cameras and from inside private premises will be analyzed and vehicle movements logged and cross-checked. Rewards for information will be offered. Witnesses will interviewed. In the police's criminal intelligence branch, the movements of known criminals will be analyzed and the networks of sources -- informers -- will be tasked to report what they hear. The details of any identifiable goods which have been stolen will be circulated to known markets, both in the UK and internationally. The detectives investigating these major crimes in the UK see them as an exciting challenge to their professionalism. They don't admire the criminals but they have less contempt for a gang that builds a sophisticated plan and causes no personal harm to anyone than say for a violent robber. But the investigation will still be relentless.\n","right_summary":"Police in London are trying to catch the gang which staged a multi-million heist during the Easter vacation.

{"document":"Microsoft hopes to lure more people to use its new Windows 10 software by making it easy to use many of the same apps they're already using on Apple or Android phones. The move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world's biggest software company, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps. The company said at its annual Build conference on Wednesday that it will release new programming tools for software developers to rapidly adapt their Apple and Android apps to run on devices that use the new Windows 10 operating system coming late this year. Scroll down for video. Microsoft hopes to lure more people to use its new Windows 10 software by making it easy to use many of the same apps they're already using on Apple or Android phones. Pictured: \u00a0Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers his keynote address at Microsoft Build in San Francisco,. New operating system will run on the 'broadest types of devices ever'. Various app stores merged into one platform, called the One Store. Return of the Start Menu, which had been removed from Windows 8. Users can create multiple desktops to keep things organised. Microsoft also announced a new name for the web browser that it plans to offer with Windows 10. The company promises its new 'Edge' browser is faster and more useful than the Internet Explorer that Microsoft has offered for the last 20 years. The tech giant is making its case for Windows 10 before an army of software developers who may be crucial allies in its campaign to build enthusiasm among consumers for the next version of Microsoft's flagship operating system, coming later this year. 'Our goal is to make Windows 10 the most attractive development platform ever,' Microsoft executive Terry Myerson told an audience of several thousand programmers and app developers. While Microsoft has already previewed some aspects of the new Windows, a parade of top executives is using the Build conference to demonstrate more software features and app-building tools, with an emphasis on mobile devices as well as PCs. Ultimately, they're hoping to win over people who have turned to smartphones and tablets that run on rival operating systems from Google and Apple. During the three-day conference, Microsoft is also expected to show off new Windows smartphones or other devices and reveal more details about such tech initiatives as the company's new Spartan web browser; its Siri-like digital assistant known as Cortana; and the HoloLens, a futuristic 'augmented reality' headset that projects three-dimensional images in a wearer's field of vision. But perhaps most importantly, this year's conference is an opportunity for Microsoft to persuade an audience of more than 5,000 techies and independent programmers that it's worth their time to create new apps and programs for Windows 10. Experts say Microsoft needs a rich variety of apps if it wants to appeal to people who are increasingly using mobile gadgets instead of personal computers. A woman wearing a HoloLens demonstrates how the technology can be used to test and develop robotics at the Microsoft Build conference in San Francisco. Internet Explorer, which was first called Windows Internet Explorer, was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 in 1995. Internet Explorer was one of the most widely used web browsers, attaining a peak of about 95 per cent during 2002 and 2003. However, it struggled in the face of competition, and in May 2012 it was announced that Google's Chrome\u00a0overtook Internet Explorer as the most used browser worldwide. The brand has struggled to shake off the bad reputation of Internet Explorer 6, which was notoriously insecure. 'Getting developer buy-in is absolutely the crucial thing,' said J.P. Gownder, a tech industry analyst at Forrester Research. He said Microsoft has struggled with a 'chicken-and-egg' problem, in which developers have been reluctant to build mobile apps for Windows because relatively few people use Windows phones and tablets. Microsoft hopes it has solved that problem by designing Windows 10 so it's easier for developers to build 'universal' apps that work on a variety of Windows devices, from phones to PCs and other gadgets, Gownder said. Currently, there are more than 1.4 million apps for Android phones and about the same for Apple devices, while there are only a few hundred thousand apps that work on Windows phones and tablets. The company also has a big carrot to wave in front of those developers: Microsoft has already said it will release Windows 10 as a free upgrade to people who now have PCs or other gadgets running the previous two versions of Windows, provided they upgrade in the coming year. The offer could create a huge new audience of Windows 10 users in a relatively short time, Gownder said. Myerson predicted there will be a billion devices using Windows 10 - from PCs to phones, tablets, gaming consoles and even holographic computers - within the next two to three years. Microsoft has not said exactly when Windows 10 is coming, and some analysts are hoping the company will announce a release date at the conference, along with details about how it will distribute future upgrades. CEO Satya Nadella and other executives have hinted they'd like to move away from the old notion of selling each new version of Windows as a separate product. Microsoft's had early success in selling its Office productivity software on a subscription basis, in which customers pay an annual fee to use programs like Word, PowerPoint and Excel. A man demonstrates a device using Windows holographic technology during the Microsoft Build conference. Nadella is presiding over a major overhaul of a company that once dominated the tech industry, in the days when PCs were king. He has redesigned some of Microsoft's most popular programs for mobile devices and invested in new 'cloud-computing' services, in which businesses pay to use software that's housed in Microsoft's data centers. Microsoft still relies heavily on selling traditional software for PCs and corporate computer systems. But its latest quarterly earnings report, issued last week, offered some signs that the decline in that business is slowing, while Microsoft's cloud-computing business is growing rapidly. The news drove Microsoft's share price up 10 percent in one day. The stock has continued to rose, trading as high as $49.13 on Wednesday - within a dollar of its 52-week high.\n","right_summary":"New programming tools can rapidly adapt Apple and Android apps.

They spare no expense or detail when they throw extravagant parties and they go to great lengths to one-up fellow members of the world\u2019s one per cent or impress their celebrity guests. Money is no object to those who like to flaunt their massive wealth at sea, and that means sales and charter brokerages are kept busy with outrageous requests for everything from high-end food and entertainment to luxurious decor and special guests. Scroll down for video. Superyachts can sell for more than \u00a350million, while others cost more than \u00a3400,000 a week to charter. Henry Smith, a sales broker with Cecil Wright, a boutique yacht brokerage with offices in Monaco and London, said: \u2018You do get some pretty unusual requests. The strange ones are demanding, particularly when food has to be sent from one place to another at the last minute. \u2018When you\u2019re doing requests like this you\u2019re paying considerably more than if you were to organise it in advance. But then again, as people say, this is yachting.\u2019 In a fast-pace world where brokers expect the unexpected, these are some of the most outrageous requests from superyacht owners and charter clients. One superyacht owner threw a party with two live tigers, allowing guests to pose for photos with the animals. Two caged tigers. A Life of Pi situation was avoided when an owner from Europe threw a party with two live Siberian tigers on board. Under the care of trained professionals, the tigers were held in glass cages on the aft deck, allowing partygoers to pose for selfies with the animals in the background. Mr Smith said the biggest challenges were sorting out the insurance and paperwork, and lifting the tigers onto the superyacht. Hoisting caged tigers onto a yacht isn\u2019t covered by the normal premiums. Mr Smith said: \u2018Getting them physically onto the yacht was an issue because they had to lift them using cranes. \u2018The people who owned the tigers were wary to allow other people to operate the machinery, and it took several weeks of paperwork once we found a specialist insurer.\u2019 Mr Smith said the tigers were rented from a circus and were taken off the yacht after the party ended. He said: \u2018It went off without a hitch in the end, but it was an awful lot of work on our end. But that\u2019s what we do, that\u2019s what we\u2019re paid for.\u2019 Cecil Wright arranged for fresh fruit and vegetables to be flown from the French Riviera to the Maldives. Special delivery \u2013 from France to the Maldives. It\u2019s the comforts of home that people miss the most when they travel for long periods, but that isn\u2019t a problem for the world\u2019s super-rich. One client had a week\u2019s worth of fruit and vegetables sent from their favourite shop in the South of France straight to their superyacht in the Maldives. Of course, the container had a travel experience that most people will never have \u2013 it was flown from France to the island nation in the Indian Ocean by private jet. Once it arrived in the Maldives it was loaded into a helicopter and delivered to the superyacht, where it landed on one of its decks. Mr Smith said there was \u2018nothing fancy\u2019 about the food, which arrived undamaged and fresh. The owner just wanted a familiar taste from back home. He said: \u2018The value of the food on the flight was significant less than the value of the flight.\u2019 Three 'A-list' musical acts were hired to perform at a private party that took four months to plan. Party on a desert island. One client wanted to have a huge party on a deserted island for 80 friends and family members, so a team of engineers had to be flown out to set up a stage and other amenities. The private party featured performances by three \u2018A-list\u2019 musical acts from the UK and US (Mr Smith wasn\u2019t at liberty to reveal their identities), who were flown in by private jet and helicopter. Mr Smith said it took four months of planning and three weeks to build the venue. This included flying in generators to power the sound and lighting systems, a professional grade kitchen and living accommodation for the construction crew. Some owners have built classrooms on board and hired teachers for around-the-world voyages. Sailing around the world in a floating classroom. Superyacht owners don\u2019t let their children\u2019s education get in the way of their ambitious plans for an around-the-world family holiday. They bring the classroom \u2013 and the teacher \u2013 with them. Mr Smith said some owners have had small classrooms built within their superyachts so their children can keep up with their studies. They have also hired teachers to deliver lessons while travelling to some of the most exotic places on Earth. For the teachers, it is an incredible way to see the world while getting paid and not having to pay for a home or utility bills. Mr Smith said: \u2018[Salary] varies enormously on things such as age and the amount of holiday they get, but you\u2019d be looking at certainly a minimum of \u00a350,000.\u2019 Great French Bake Off. Baking an eight-tier cake is a very complex and time-consuming process, and a boulangerie in the South of France had just 24 hours to prepare one after a \u2018last-minute\u2019 request. The cake, decorated with edible flowers, was prepared in a hurry for a guest\u2019s birthday party in Saint-Tropez in the French Riviera. Mr Smith said: \u2018They were working flat-out to make this thing, and it required a lot of convincing on our part to convince them to do it. \u2018This eight-tier monster cake looked like a bouquet almost, with lots of very intricately designed and hand-cut edible flowers. It was impressive to say the least.\u2019 One crew had just two hours to blow up 2,500 pink and silver balloons for a girl's birthday party. \u2018A sea of pink and silver\u2019 Sticking with the birthday theme, Cecil Wright once received a request to organise a surprise birthday party for an owner\u2019s granddaughter. The crew had just two hours to blow up 2,500 pink and silver balloons, using compressed air tanks, as it was the only time the youngster was off the vessel. Mr Smith said: \u2018They finished just in time. It was a huge panic and a rush, and they had to bring in a few guys to help from other yachts. It was just a sea of pink and silver.\u2019 Two owners exchanged a Steinway grand piano, but it had to be dismantled and transported across Europe. The world's toughest piano move? When one owner (let\u2019s call him Mr X) purchased a \u20ac70million (\u00a350million) superyacht it had a Steinway grand piano on board. But he was not a fan, so he gifted the beautiful piano to his friend (who we\u2019ll call Mr Y). The only problem was that Mr X\u2019s yacht was in Spain and Mr Y\u2019s was in Germany. Instead of waiting until the yachts were in the same port, a team from Steinway was brought in to dismantle the piano, package it and transport it across Europe to Mr Y\u2019s yacht, where they put it together. The cost of dismantling and moving the piano was nearly the same as purchasing a new one. Cecil Wright arranged the installation of a squash court on a helipad that lowers with the press of a button. Squash at sea. Cecil Wright was responsible for installing the world\u2019s first squash court on a superyacht. The full-size court was set up on a helipad that can be lowered with the press of a button when it\u2019s not in use. It is a permanent fixture on the ship, and doubles as a helicopter hangar. New destination, new wardrobe. One couple hated travelling with luggage so much that they don\u2019t bother anymore, and they get a new wardrobe delivered every time they embark on a new voyage. Mr Smith said: \u2018Whenever they arrive all their clothes from the previous time are removed and new clothes are added.\u2019 In addition to the latest fashions, the couple travels with an entourage that includes a hair stylist, nail technician, a doctor and maid.\n","right_summary":"Superyacht owners spare no expense when they throw extravagant parties.

A 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were both charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg on Thursday.

Police have charged a man and woman over the discovery of a mass greyhound dog grave in Bundaberg. A 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were both charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg, Queensland, on Thursday. A Queensland Police and RSPCA taskforce, set up after the greyhound racing industry was rocked by the live baiting scandal in February, also found ammunition shells from a .22 calibre gun. The pair, both from Bundaberg, will appear in the Bundaberg Magistrates Court on Friday. RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says it's understood the dogs were killed before a Four Corners special which exposed the horrors of the greyhound racing industry. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' Beatty told Fairfax media. The carcasses of more than 50 greyhounds were found at the bush site in Coonarr on Tuesday. At least 55 carcasses were found in the Coonarr area, near Bundaberg, on Tuesday, with the RSPCA.\u00a0Early investigations suggest the dogs were young dogs that were killed as they were too slow. 'Unfortunately as I think most people would be aware, there's always been a lot of wastage in the greyhound industry.' Police said it was unclear how long the dogs' bodies had been there, but confirmed they were found in various states of decomposition. There were no greyhound training facilities or other connections to the racing industry in the area, a police spokesperson said. Queensland Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller expressed her outrage on Twitter after the discovery. 'Absolutely sickened that @QPSmedia and @RSPCAQLD have found the remains of 55 greyhounds. Animal cruelty in Qld won't be tolerated,' she wrote. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' an RSPCA spokesperson told Fairfax media. There were no greyhound training facilities or other connections to the racing industry in the area, a police spokesperson said. The taskforce was established to investigate the use of live baiting using possums, rabbits and piglets to train competitive greyhounds. It came after an ABC Four Corners expose from earlier this year sparked widespread outrage after showing racing dogs chasing and mauling live animals. So far, five people have been charged with a total of 23 offences in the state. An independent review headed up by barrister Alan MacSporran SC is also being conducted into the practice. It's expected to be completed in about three months' time. This review aims to find out how widespread the use of live baiting is in Queensland, and how it could go undetected for so long.

{"document":"When Ellia Beasley was a teenager, she enjoyed singing along to the lyrics of one of her favourite tunes - Rooftops by Lost Prophets. She loved the song so much, she decided to have a tattoo on her belly in 2012 featuring the lyrics 'scream your heart out'. But the aspiring model from New Milton, Hampshire, lived to regret her decision after the band's lead singer was later exposed as a serial paedophile and child abuser. Scroll down for video. Ellia Beasley has more than 20 tattoos but lived to regret featuring Lost Prophet lyrics in one of her inkings. Ellia had the line 'scream your heart out' written across her belly from the song Rooftops. Ian Watkins, 37, was sent to prison for 35 years in 2013 after being convicted of a string of child sex offences - including the attempted rape of a fan's baby. Ellia said she was shocked when she heard about Watkin's depraved crimes - and hated the fact she was associated with him thanks to her tattoo. 'When I found out about Ian Watkins I was disgusted,' she said on the new series of Channel 5 show Tattoo Disasters. 'It's wrong and he completely abused his power. I was ashamed I had something of his on my body and it's stuck there.' In an interview with FEMAIL, Ellia, now 22, said she was never a huge fan of the band but she had the tattoo because the lyrics resonated with her when she was younger. Singer Ian Watkins was sent to prison for 35 years for a string of child sex offences. 'Scream your heart out didn't have any personal meaning but it was a line that stuck in my head and I liked singing it aloud,' she said. 'I wanted to have a tattoo across the bottom of my stomach and I thought lyrics would look good there so I chose that line because I liked the song.' The tattoo - which cost \u00a360 - was not Ellia's first. She already had eight and now has more than 20 (she's lost count of the exact number) on her arms, legs and body. But she no longer wanted to have the Lost Prophet's lyrics following Watkin's imprisonment and struggled to cover it up when she wore crop tops and vests when regularly working out at the gym. 'Everyone kept asking me what I was going to do about it,' she said. She admitted that laser removal surgery was 'not an option' as she had heard it was extremely painful and expensive. So instead, she contacted a number of tattoo artists to see if they could cover the lyrics by working them into a new tattoo design. But none of the artists she spoke to could think of a way to do it. They told her the tattoo was too bold to be obscured. However, Ellia was then put in contact with tattooist to the stars Kevin Paul who is based in Derbyshire. He has inked the bodies of many famous people including Ed Sheeran and Harry Styles. Ellia with tattooist to the stars Kevin Paul who had an idea of a design to cover the lyrics. Before: Ellia had been told she would never be rid of the line because the tattoo was too big and bold. After: Kevin was able to hide the lyrics with this owl design that Ellia loves. After meeting Ellia, he came up with the idea to paint a giant owl on her stomach. After agreeing to the design, Ellia spent a total of ten and a half hours at Kevin's studio having the tattoo drawn and coloured in. She said getting the tattoo was 'horrifically painful' but she has no regrets. She said: 'I really like the new design. It's pretty and you can't see the lyrics at all now, you would never know they had been there.' The experience hasn't put Ellia off having more tattoos in the future - in fact she's already planning to have a giant picture of Ganesh painted across her whole back. But she added she would think twice about having lyrics tattooed on her body again - unless they had a personal significance.\n","right_summary":"Ellia Beasley loved singing along to Lost Prophets song as a teen.

{"document":"Jose Aldo and Conor McGregor may have taken the spotlight over the past two weeks when it comes to the UFC's featherweight division, but this weekend it's time for two other top ranked 145ers to take centre stage, as No 1 ranked Chad Mendes and No 4 ranked Ricardo Lamas meet in Fairfax, in a bout which could potentially determine the next challenger to the title. Mendes' only two professional losses have come at the hands of the Brazilian king and Lamas also dropped a decision to Aldo when the two met in February last year. But it is Aldo's upcoming opponent, Irishman McGregor, who has dominated conversation in the lead up to this weekend's fight. Opponents Chad Mendes and Ricardo Lamas face off during the UFC weigh-in at the Patriot Center. Lamas holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym on in Fairfax, Virginia. 'I thought Aldo handled it well' said Team Alpha Male's Mendes, when asked about Aldo's reaction to McGregor snatching the championship belt on stage in Dublin. 'But that's Conor, he is crazy, you know,' Mendes continued. 'Aldo has been the champion for a long time. Conor is the type of guy who is always going to run his mouth, but I highly doubt Aldo is going to let that get to him. I feel like whoever wins, I'm good. I think Aldo is a better mixed martial artist so I think he is going to win. He knows what he is doing - I just see him winning the fight.' A stark contrast to the championship pairing, Mendes and Lamas have shown nothing but respect for one another in the lead up to Saturday night's main event. Mendes flexes his guns at the weight-in before his clash with rival Lamas at the Patriot Centre. Mendes is put though his paces in front of the fans ahead of the fight against Lamas in Fairfield. Anticipating a war when they meet, 'Money' Mendes is confident that he is stronger than 'The Bully' in every department and that, should he win convincingly, he believes the fans will want to see him get a third crack at Aldo. 'I think Ricardo is a tough guy - he is good everywhere, you know. But the thing is, I feel like everything that he is good at, I'm just that little bit better,' he added. 'I'm hoping that if I win this fight, then enough people will want to watch a third fight between me and Aldo and that the UFC will give it to us, but we'll see what happens. 'If I can get out there and totally dominate, then hopefully that will be enough to get me another shot. I'm expecting a war out there - like I said, Lamas is a tough, tough fighter.' Mendes holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym in Fairfax, Virginia. And Mendes is not the only one eyeing up a second shot at the featherweight title. Chicago-born Lamas claims he is under no illusions that he will be in for an easy night with Mendes. 'If I keep performing well then the title shot will come,' he said. 'Mendes is a cool guy. He is a good sport and he is a respectful fighter. But this is going to be a tough fight and when it comes to the night, you're going to see us both try to go in there and take each other out. 'I feel like I am strong for my weight but Mendes is a powerhouse too, so we will see what happens. I feel like Chad is a great fighter so we're going to bring the best out of each other, for sure.' Lamas stretches his legs with a kick as he prepares to take on Mendes with an open training session.

{"document":"It took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that former NFL star Aaron Hernandez killed semi-pro player Odin Lloyd. On Monday, Hernandez's defense gave its side of the story, wrapping up its witnesses in less than a day. Hernandez, 25, is on trial for the shooting death of Lloyd, whose body was found in a Massachusetts industrial park in June 2013. Now that the defense has rested, it won't be long before the jury begins deliberating. Much of the evidence in the former New England Patriots' case is circumstantial. Here are some key points jurors will have to consider after each side makes closing arguments on Tuesday:. As news spread that Hernandez was under investigation in June 2013, Patriots owner Robert Kraft called in the tight end for a meeting two days after Lloyd's death. \"He said he was not involved,\" Kraft testified last week. \"He said he was innocent, and that he hoped that the time of the murder incident came out because he said he was in a club.\" There's only one potential problem with that claim: The time Lloyd was killed hadn't been made public yet by the time Hernandez met with Kraft. So how could Hernandez have known when Lloyd was killed? \"What a great, great witness for the prosecution,\" CNN legal analyst Mel Robbins said. \"Basically what happened is Aaron Hernandez lied to his boss. And the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand.\" When questioned by a defense attorney, Kraft said that he'd never had any problems with Hernandez and that the player was always respectful to him. Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, revealed for the first time last week that Hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple's home that she said reeked of marijuana. She also said she didn't know what was in the box. That revelation may contradict the prosecution's contention that the weapon used in the killing was in the box. The murder weapon in the case has not been recovered. During cross-examination by the defense, Jenkins testified that she suspected marijuana because the box smelled \"skunky.\" Earlier, she told prosecutors during direct examination that she didn't know what was in the box. She said Hernandez never told her, and she never looked. After concealing the box with her daughter's clothing, Jenkins said she threw it away in \"a random dumpster\" but could not remember exactly where. Much testimony has focused on the shoes Hernandez wore the night Lloyd was shot. A Nike consultant testified that Hernandez was wearing Nike Air Jordan Retro 11 Lows. About 93,000 pairs of that shoe were made, significantly fewer in a size 13. The shoe's sole makes a distinct impression, said Lt. Steven Bennett of the Massachusetts State Police. The consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney Jamie Sultan that other Nike shoes -- more than 3 million -- make the same impression. Yet Bennett, who works in crime scene services, testified that the footprint left near Lloyd's body was \"in agreement\" or consistent with the Air Jordan Retro 11 Lows size 13. Although he did not have the shoes that Hernandez wore that night, he used an identical pair to make his determination. Bennett did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression. Jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression. What may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney Jamie Sultan. Sultan questioned the science behind analyzing footprints. He introduced a March 2014 investigative report written by Bennett saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to be able to make a comparison. Prosecutors used grainy footage from Hernandez's home security system to suggest he was holding a .45-caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill Lloyd. Hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after Lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from Hernandez's home. \"In my opinion, the firearm shown in the video stills is a Glock pistol,\" Glock sales manager Kyle Aspinwall testified. The video is time-stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say Lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car Hernandez was driving. Hernandez's lawyers then showed a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with Hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand, suggesting it may be an iPad. \"Glock pistols don't have white glows to them, do they?\" defense attorney James Sultan asked. \"No, they do not,\" Aspinwall answered. Sultan then displayed a soft-pellet gun similar in shape to a Glock, suggesting it could also be the object Hernandez is holding. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in Lloyd's death. But already, his arrest has led to deep consequences, including his release from the New England Patriots and the loss of millions of dollars in expected earnings. So what might make a young man who had signed a $40 million contract risk everything? Prosecutors have said Lloyd might have done or said something that didn't sit well with Hernandez. They claimed Hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated a hit to settle the score. Hernandez's co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. But the case gets more complicated. Evidence collected in Lloyd's death investigation led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston. Hernandez is also accused of shooting Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub. That double shooting took place in July 2012, almost a year before Lloyd was killed. Prosecutors have said in pretrial hearings that Hernandez may have been mad at himself for possibly showing Lloyd the spot where that double murder happened. During trial, prosecutors suggest a text written by Hernandez the day before the murder saying he was \"buggin\" for showing Lloyd \"the spot\" may have played a role in plotting to kill Lloyd. The judge has banned any mention of the double murder in Lloyd's trial, ruling it is prejudicial. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in those deaths as well. But when the Lloyd trial ends, that murder trial awaits him. CNN's Jason Hanna, Lawrence Crook, Laura Dolan and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.\n","right_summary":"Closing arguments in the case are set for Tuesday. Aaron Hernandez is charged with first-degree murder in the killing of Odin Lloyd. His defense lawyers made their case on Monday.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Aaron Hernandez could not have committed the murder of Odin Lloyd because he was in a club at the time of the shooting, as confirmed by his boss, Patriots owner Robert Kraft. In addition, newly-revealed evidence suggests that the box Hernandez's fiancee got rid of did not contain the murder weapon. The prosecution's case also relies heavily on faulty footprint analysis and grainy security footage. Hernandez's defense lawyers have presented a strong case and the jury is expected to acquit him."}

{"document":"Eden Hazard has admitted an intense campaign with Chelsea may have left him too tired to perform at the best of his ability after he was substituted just 62 minutes into Belgium's win over Israel on Tuesday. Hazard has played 48 games this season for club and country, missing just five matches for Chelsea and being an ever-present in their Barclays Premier League title charge. But as Belgium struggled to a hard-fought 1-0 win over Israel in European Championship qualifying group B, Hazard was withdrawn by manager Marc Wilmots with 28 minutes to go having found it difficult to get the better of his marker Orel Dgani. Eden Hazard has admitted an intense campaign with Chelsea may have left him too tired to perform at his best. Hazard was substituted with 28 minutes In Belgium's 1-0 win over Israel in Jerusalem on Tuesday night. The 24-year-old playmaker has played all but five of Chelsea's games this season, mainly avoiding injury. The 24-year-old playmaker was clearly unhappy to have been substituted and looked to shoot Wilmots a disapproving look as he left the field to be replaced by Nacer Chadli before questioning the manager on his decision after the game. \u2018I was a little bit surprised to be substituted,' Hazard said. 'Also, I was a little bit unhappy and I think you could see that I was unhappy. \u2018I asked the coach for a reason and he told me that I was tired. Maybe I was a little bit tired. I\u2019ve played a lot of games this season.\u2019 In his post-match comments,\u00a0Wilmots added: \u2018Hazard is not hurt, but I had the impression that he was tired. In these kind of games, you have to react immediately because we did not have time.' Belgium manager Marc Wilmots said he felt that Hazard looked tired, something the player questioned him on. Hazard scored early on in Chelsea's last game, a 3-2 win over Hull City, but the team were pegged back. Hazard is unlikely to get an extended rest any time soon as he returns to Premier League action on Saturday. Belgium captain Vincent Kompany was sent off for a second yellow card within two minutes of Hazard's withdrawal, leaving Belgium clinging on to their slender lead, and Wilmots admitted he may not have substituted his star man had he known his side would be down to 10 men. Despite his admission, Hazard is unlikely to get an extended rest any time soon as he returns to Premier League action with the visit of Stoke City to Stamford Bridge on Saturday. And with a tough run-in and another international break still to come, the Belgian forward could rack up as many as 59 appearances by the time the season finally ends in mid-June. Belgium's win in Jerusalem saw them return to the top of their qualifying group, ahead of Wales on goal difference. They travel to face them in Cardiff in their next competitive game on June 12.

{"document":"David Cameron will today warn English voters the SNP's new powers could impact their lives. David Cameron will today risk infuriating the SNP by vowing to conduct an annual review of the fairness of the Scottish government\u2019s policies on the rest of the UK. A Conservative government would create a new principle to ensure decisions by Holyrood do not have an \u2018unforeseen detrimental effect\u2019 for people south of the border, he will say. The Prime Minister will tell voters in England that new powers for the Scottish Parliament mean it \u2018can now have a big impact on your job, your income, and investment in your area\u2019. Mr Cameron will call the idea the \u2018Carlisle Principle\u2019 \u2013 named to reflect the sort of border communities in the rest of the UK that could be particularly badly affected by decisions taken by the Scottish government. There has been growing resentment in England and Wales at the \u2018apartheid\u2019 between those living north and south of the border in areas such as healthcare and university fees. For instance, cancer drugs have been made available on the NHS in Scotland that are not prescribed elsewhere, meaning taxpayers in England and Wales are contributing to funding them, but not benefiting. The Scottish Parliament\u2019s new powers to cut air passenger duty could lead to air travellers and airports in the north of England being unfairly disadvantaged \u2013 and require targeted tax cuts, Mr Cameron will say. However, Scottish Nationalists are likely to accuse Mr Cameron of wanting Westminster to \u2018mark the Scottish Parliament\u2019s homework\u2019 every year. He will also be accused of seeking to stoke anti-Scottish sentiment in the rest of the UK \u2013 and throwing fuel on the fire of Scottish nationalism. The Tory manifesto promises to introduce a principle of \u2018English votes for English laws\u2019, meaning English MPs will be given a veto over legislation relating solely to England. Under Mr Cameron\u2019s latest plan, a formal assessment would be made by the Treasury and Cabinet Office each year of the impact of Scottish policies, including tax rates, business levies, university tuition fees and healthcare. Mr Cameron risks the wrath of Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon (pictured above) with his announcement. The Chancellor will tell MPs \u2018what action is needed to make sure there is no detriment to the rest of the country\u2019. The Prime Minister, on a campaign visit to the North West, will insist the plan will not stop the Scottish government taking the decisions it wants. \u2018In the Scottish referendum, we made a clear promise to devolve more powers to the Scottish Parliament,\u2019 Mr Cameron will say. \u2018After we won that referendum, we kept our promise, and agreement was reached \u2013 for the first time \u2013 between all five of Scotland\u2019s major parties to give the Scottish Parliament extensive new powers. \u2018But as we go further in devolving powers to Scotland, we need to make sure devolution works for all the other all parts of this country too. \u2018Today I want to set out a new principle \u2013 you could call it the Carlisle Principle \u2013 that we will make sure that there are no unforeseen detrimental consequences to the rest of the country from Scottish devolution.\u2019 Boris Johnson and Sir John Major will enter the election fray this week as the Tories try to bolster their campaign. Sir John will warn of the dangers of a Labour-SNP government. The ex-premier could be deployed to speak as early as tomorrow. Later in the week, David Cameron is due to make a first high-profile campaign appearance with Mr Johnson. There are growing calls from Tory MPs for the London mayor to be \u2018weaponised\u2019. David Cameron has revealed he is locked in a high stakes battle: over ear-piercing. While contesting a general election campaign, he is also in a 'fight' with eldest daughter Nancy about when she can have her ears pierced. The Prime Minister also admitted he does not want his children to follow wife Samantha in having tattoo. In an interview with the Sun, Mr Cameron said his children 'take the mickey out of me daily', including mocking his TV and music choices. 'To them I'm just a normal dad, who they think is a bit square and sometimes embarrassing. It's very sobering to come home to after a day in the office,' he said. 'They rib me about, you know, anything from my CD collection to what I watch on TV.' Nancy is due to start secondary school in September, and wants to have her ears pierced. Mr Cameron said: 'I'm in that fight with Nancy at the moment. We'll probably reach an agreement over what age she can have them done. We're in negotiations.' His wife Samantha has a small tattoo of a dolphin on her right ankle, which she had done while travelling as a student. She has said it would 'fine' if her children copied her. But Mr Cameron said: 'I'm not a big fan. I love Samantha's tattoo, it's very small, very discreet. But I'd be a square dad and tell the children to think very carefully about it.'\n","right_summary":"A Tory government would create a new principle to review SNP policies.

{"document":"There's a stampede of investigators in California. The FBI said Friday that it will investigate whether civil rights were violated during the videotaped beating of a suspect in San Bernardino. The suspect  allegedly fled by car, foot and horseback when law enforcement officers tried to arrest him. Earlier Friday, San Bernardino Sheriff John McMahon said criminal investigations have begun into the actions of deputies as well as the suspect. In addition, an internal investigation has been launched. Ten deputies identified as being involved in the case have been put on paid administrative leave, McMahon said Friday. In video captured by cameras aboard a helicopter for KNBC, deputies gather around the man after he falls from a horse he was riding to flee from them. The video shows deputies using a stun gun on him and then repeatedly kicking and hitting him. KNBC reported that the man -- identified by authorities as Francis Pusok -- appeared to be kicked 17 times, punched 37 times and hit with a baton four times. Pusok was later hospitalized, KNBC reported, citing authorities. \"The video surrounding this arrest is disturbing and I have ordered an internal investigation be conducted immediately,\" McMahon said in a statement. \"What I saw on the television was thugs beating up my client,\" said Jim Terrell, Pusok's family attorney, according to CNN affiliate KCAL. \"That's what I saw. And these questions about what was he doing? What did they do? This is far worse than Rodney King.\" The ACLU of Southern California issued a statement Friday saying that it was \"deeply troubled\" by the images. \"While we applaud Sheriff John McMahon's prompt decision to investigate the disturbing actions of his deputies, we believe more is needed,\" the organization said. \"Too often the department has failed to address questions, including those raised by the ACLU SoCal, about use of force and Taser policies.\" Coming soon: An app to report police brutality. The Thursday afternoon incident began when deputies tried to serve a search warrant in an identity-theft investigation, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. Pusok fled in a vehicle, and deputies pursued him through the unincorporated area of Apple Valley, the town of Apple Valley and farther into the unincorporated area of Hesperia, the sheriff's office said in a news release. Pusok abandoned his vehicle and fled on foot into steep, rugged terrain, with deputies pursing with off-highway vehicles and helicopters, the sheriff's office said. \"Within minutes, deputies received information that the suspect came into contact with a group of people near the Deep Creek Hot Springs and stole a horse. He fled on horseback on dirt trails, through very rugged, steep terrain, causing numerous injuries to the horse,\" the sheriff's office said. A helicopter dropped deputies onto the ground, and as they approached Pusok to make the arrest, he was thrown from the horse, the sheriff's office said. The sheriff's office said a Taser was used on Pusok but was ineffective because of his loose clothing. A deputy was injured when the horse Pusok had been riding kicked him, the Sheriff's Department said. Two other deputies were treated for dehydration. The incident comes amid heightened scrutiny of police use of force after the 2014 deaths of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the recent shooting of Walter Scott in South Carolina. In the California case, the FBI said the results of its investigation will be forwarded to the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Central District of California and Justice Department in Washington to determine whether prosecution is warranted. Did police use excessive force? 3 cases in the spotlight.

At just 18.5in from foot to shoulder, this diminutive fellow looks as if he was the runt of his litter. He is, in fact, a fully grown husky-corgi cross. But, unbelievably, Max has been abandoned and he's looking for a home. He's become a favourite with workers at the Dogs Trust in Basildon, Essex, who have been looking after him since he was found. Max (pictured) is a 18.5in high fully-grown husky corgi cross. After being abandoned, he has now taken refuge at the Dogs Trust in Basildon, Essex. Huskies, such as the one pictured, have become increasingly popular due to shows such as Game of Thrones. Pictured is a typical Welsh corgi. Max is part corgi, part husky, and is looking for a new home. 'It quickly became apparent that he was the epitome of the saying good things come in small packages,' says the Trust's Sam Davis.

There are currently 54 other wolf-like breeds being cared for by the charity's network of animal rehousing centres. The Trust is in no doubt that the trend is partly due to fans wanting to follow the stars of Game Of Thrones and Twilight, which have popularised wolf-like dogs such as Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian huskies.

{"document":"The Scottish Professional Football League has performed a U-turn by switching Rangers' final-day clash with Hearts back to Saturday, May 2. The league found itself at the centre of a furious row on Wednesday after announcing it had moved Gers' Tynecastle fixture with the Jambos to May 3 - 24 hours after their rivals for second place in the Scottish Championship, Hibernian, completed their campaign at Falkirk. The decision was made after TV broadcaster Sky decided to screen the match live but Hibs hit out at the change, claiming it would place the league's sporting integrity at risk as they jostled with Rangers for the play-off slots. Rangers' Marius Zaliukas (right) dribbles with the ball as Livingston's Jordan White (left) gives chase. Zaliukas (left) jumps highest to score his side's equalising goal during the 1-1 draw with Livingston. The three other clubs involved have all backed the Easter Road club's stance - but the SPFL released a controversial statement on Wednesday night admitting it was puzzled by the fall-out. It said: 'It is not clear to us why this has caused so much surprise'. But now it has been forced to backtrack after Sky gave the league the thumbs up to move the Rangers-Hearts clash at Tynecastle back to its original date. All other Championship fixtures will now be moved to 12.15pm to match the kick-off in Gorgie. Confirming the move, a league spokesperson said: 'Following consultation between the SPFL, member clubs and broadcast partners regarding the final round of Championship fixtures over the weekend of May 2 and 3, Sky Sports has now suggested an alternative schedule for its televised Championship match that weekend. 'As a result, we are pleased to confirm all five Championship matches that weekend will now kick-off simultaneously at 12.15pm on Saturday, May 2. The Hearts v Rangers match will be televised live on Sky Sports. 'The SPFL would like to thank Sky Sports for its flexibility and understanding and we're sure all football fans will look forward to an exciting climax to the Championship season.' Speaking before the switch, Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan admitted if he had been in charge, Rangers and Hibernian would have always kicked off at the same time. Easter Road chief executive Leeann Dempster feared the rescheduling would give the Ibrox side an advantage as they would know exactly what kind of result would be required to clinch the runners-up slot - saving them the bother of two extra games in the play-offs. Regan refused to directly criticise his SPFL counterpart Neil Doncaster for allowing the fixture change which has sparked the drama in the first place - but he did admit his personal preference would be to have all teams battling for vital play-off spots played at the same time. Rangers' Kenny Miller (right) tussles for the ball with Livingston's Declan\u00a0Gallacher (left) during the 1-1 draw. The SFA boss - who made his comments at the launch of the Football Memories project at Hampden - said: 'Sporting integrity is fundamental to any competition and I think that has to be considered in the round [of fixtures]. 'The clubs have made their feelings known and I'm sure Neil and his colleagues have listened to what their member clubs have said and come back with a pragmatic proposal. 'My preference in a play-off situation is having games finishing at the same time. 'It's not for me to stand here and criticise how another body has dealt with things. The clubs themselves have made their feelings known to the league. I know Neil and his colleagues have taken that on board and will do what they can to satisfy the various parties.' The row followed two days on intense negotiations with police and TV companies over the Premiership post-split fixtures and Regan added: 'Clearly the SPFL have come under pressure from a number of sources over the last 24\/48 hours,' he said. 'But I'm sure Neil and his colleagues will be looking at the fall-out from the feedback they have received and trying to come up with a proposal. 'It's not helpful when you have negative issues being constantly played out in the press. When you get to the climax to the season, there is a lot at stake. 'It's never easy when you are trying to balance the needs of broadcasters, clubs, fans and sponsors but my view on this is that the fans come first and they have to be considered. I'm sure Neil will listen and come back with an appropriate and pragmatic solution.'

A grinning Ri Sol-Ju, wearing what appeared to be a wedding ring on her left hand, was pictured clapping next to her smiling husband Kim Jong-un during a men's football match at Kim Il Sung Stadium on Monday, the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.

Laughing with her husband, Kim Jong-un, as the pair watch a celebratory football match, Ri Sol-Ju is seen for the first time since December. The match was being held as part of a lavish series of events celebrating the 103rd birthday of Kim Il-Sung, the young leader's grandfather, which falls on Wednesday. North Korea designates the 'Day of the Sun' as a rare two-day national holiday, with art performances, exhibitions and sporting events, and pilgrimages to the late leader's birthplace in Pyongyang. A former member of the North's Unhasu Orchestra, Ri was last seen in public in December 2014, when she and her husband attended a ceremony to commemorate the third anniversary of the death of Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-Il. Their marriage was only revealed in July 2012 when pictures emerged of a young woman accompanying Kim at official events in a break from the past, when the North's first ladies were kept out of the limelight. She was pictured wearing stylish, expensive-looking outfits and on one occasion sported what appeared to be a Christian Dior handbag, in a country plagued by chronic poverty. Their marriage was only revealed in July 2012 when pictures emerged of a young woman accompanying Kim at official events. But Ri has been out of the spotlight since December for unknown reasons. The Kim dynasty has ruled the isolated state for nearly seven decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult. Kim Il-Sung led North Korea from its establishment in 1948 until his death on July 8, 1994. He was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-Il, who also ruled until his death in December 2011 when power was transferred to his son and current leader Kim Jong-un. KCNA said 'an endless stream of people' was visiting, Mangyongdae, the birthplace of Kim Il-Sung, as the 'Day of the Sun' draws near. The images of the couple at a podium flanked by top party officials were published in state media. On Sunday more than 800 runners took place in an international marathon watched by hundreds of fans, including some 600 from abroad, as part of the celebrations. 'Attending the race were more than 600 marathon fans from dozens of countries including Malaysia, Singapore, Sweden, Finland, UK and Italy,' KCNA said. The North announced in February that the April 12 marathon would only be open to domestic runners this year, because of lingering concerns over the Ebola epidemic in west Africa. But it last month reversed a ban on foreigners taking part in the annual run, after lifting strict travel restrictions aimed at keeping out the Ebola virus.

'(We) had a blip towards the end there but there is still plenty of batting left in that dressing room and fingers crossed we can kick on and make a big first innings score.' Root's personal effort was also his sixth Test century - his first came on home territory at Headingley in 2013 against New Zealand, a side he could well be facing later this year. The Yorkshireman added: 'I'm just trying to score as many runs as I can each time. The more I can make over a hundred, the better. 'I feel good. My movements are very good at the minute. You go through blips (in your career) and the key now for me is to score as many as I can while I have this going for me.' Ben Stokes is given a salute send-off by his West Indian rival Marlon Samuels after holing out for eight runs. Trott answered some of the criticisms levelled at him after he struggled on his Test comeback in Antigua, but was still after more. 'Alastair and I were really pleased to put on a good start but I'm sure both of us are disappointed we couldn't go on and make a bigger score,' he said. 'You don't spend all those hours in the nets to get fifties, you go there to get match defining hundreds. 'But we get on pretty well, we've got a goods understanding in the middle and it was nice to get back in the groove.'\n","right_summary":"Joe Root hit 118 not out to help England into a 74-run lead on day three.

{"document":"The family rift in France\u2019s National Front deepened yesterday after founder Jean-Marie Le Pen pulled out of regional elections \u2013 but said his granddaughter should stand in his place. The 86-year-old\u2019s announcement came after he infuriated his daughter Marine, the far-right party\u2019s current leader, with a series of racist and anti-Semitic remarks last week. Mr Le Pen had repeated his claim that the Holocaust - in which the Nazis murdered six million Jews - was \u2018a detail of history\u2019 and had also praised France\u2019s wartime leader Marshal Petain, who collaborated with Hitler. Keeping it in the family: National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, 86, right, \u00a0angered daughter Marine, 46, and now wants granddaughter Marion Marechal-Le Pen, 25, to replace him in the regional elections. Next generation: Shortly after her grandfather's comments,\u00a0Marion Marechal-Le Pen, 25, pictured with Le Pen in 2012, confirmed that she would seek the party\u2019s nomination. His 46-year-old daughter had reacted furiously to the outburst, saying she would oppose his candidacy in regional elections in December and accusing him of \u2018political suicide\u2019. Now party founder Le Pen has told French publication Le Figaro that he will not stand in the south-east Provence-Alpes-Cote d\u2019Azur region \u2018even though I think I am the best candidate\u2019. He said it was because the party was at risk of being \u2018dangerously weakened\u2019 over what he called a severe but unjustified crisis over his comments. The former paratrooper, who remains the Front\u2019s honorary president and will retain his seat in the European Parliament, said: \u2018If I must make a sacrifice for the future of the movement, I would not be the one to cause it damage,\u2019 Mr Le Pen said the best replacement candidate would be his grand-daughter Marion Marechal-Le Pen, 25, who confirmed shortly after that she would seek the party\u2019s nomination. Family feud: National Front leader Marine accused her father of 'political suicide' after he called\u00a0the Holocaust \u2018a detail of history\u2019 and had also praised France\u2019s wartime leader Marshal Petain. Mr Le Pen told the magazine: \u2018If she accepts, I think she would head a very good list (of candidates). She is certainly the best, I am not going to say after me, but she is.\u2019 His granddaughter is seen as more socially conservative than her aunt. Unlike Marine, Marion was firmly against a 2013 law permitting same-sex marriage in France. Asked if he felt betrayed by his daughter, Mr Le Pen told Le Figaro Magazine: \u2018Betrayed would be going a bit far, but let\u2019s say I\u2019m disappointed.\u2019 A top party official, Florian Philippot, said on i-Tele television that Le Pen had discussed the decision with party leadership. By standing down, Mr Le Pen avoids possible formal exclusion as a candidate on Friday, when the National Front\u2019s political bureau meets to designate who will run in the December election. Opinion polls see Marine Le Pen as likely to make it to the second round of 2017 presidential elections but not win.\n","right_summary":"National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen pulls out of regional elections.

{"document":"It's been almost a fortnight since Jeremy Clarkson was sacked from Top Gear, but the news hasn't stopped his estranged wife from enjoying herself after she jetted off on holiday to Barbados. The 53-year-old spent the Easter weekend with friends and family on the Caribbean island where she sunbathed and drove a jet ski. She has previously holidayed in the area with the 54-year-old broadcaster but the pair, who have two daughters and a son, are said to have lived apart for  years. Scroll down for video. Holiday: Frances Clarkson, 53, spent the Easter Bank Holiday weekend with family and friends in Barbados. The BBC announced last month they were dropping Clarkson from the hit motoring show after a 'fracas' involving a Top Gear producer. Clarkson left Oisin Tymon needing hospital treatment after punching him at a hotel in Hawes, North Yorkshire, after staff wouldn't serve him a hot meal following a day of filming. He has repeatedly apologised to Mr Tymon both in public and privately and it was announced today that he will not face any criminal charges for the attack. Rushing to his side to comfort him throughout the ordeal has been events organiser Phillipa Sage, 45, who became a feature in his life in 2010 when he was still in a relationship with Frances. It was claimed last year that his marriage had been under strain after reports he had engaged in extra-martial affairs. Last summer he told the MailOnline's Piers Morgan he was 'going through a difficult divorce'. In April 2011 Clarkson was accused of having an affair with Miss Sage while touring Australia, South Africa and Norway with his Top Gear co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May. Sunshine: Frances was spotted in a black bikini as she drove a jet ski and caught some rays in the sun. Relax: The 53-year-old has previously holidayed on the island with her estranged husband Jeremy Clarkson. He was alleged to have spent several nights with Miss Sage and kissed her on the lips in full view of observers on one occasion. Clarkson shrugged off the claims at the time, saying that he and Miss Sage had been simply 'colleagues fooling around'. But shortly afterwards it was revealed that he was spending time during the week living in a bachelor pad in London. He denied that he had moved out of the family home in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, saying he used the London flat when he was editing Top Gear. Clarkson was photographed kissing Miss Sage while on holiday with her in Greece in 2013, and they also visited Australia again. In October 2011 Clarkson lifted a High Court gagging order preventing his first wife, Alex Hall, from claiming that he had had an affair with her after he married Frances. Split: Frances has two daughters and a son with the 54-year-old broadcaster, but the pair are said to have been living apart for years. Distant:\u00a0The BBC announced last month they were dropping her estranged husband from the hit motoring show after a 'fracas' involving a Top Gear producer. Break: Frances walks along the beach with an unidentified man during the Easter holiday to the Caribbean. Mrs Hall, who married him in 1989 but separated from him after less than two years, alleged that they rekindled their relationship from 1999 onwards \u2013 something he denied. Clarkson married Frances in 1993 and she encouraged him to cultivate a more aggressive on-screen persona to make Top Gear more controversial, say friends. In recent years he has been caught up in other controversies, including being accused of racism after he called an Asian man a 'slope' when he joked about the construction of a bridge in Thailand during an episode of Top Gear. Estranged: Jeremy and Frances Clarkson married in 1993 but the pair have not lived together for years. Friends claim that it was Frances who pushed\u00a0him to cultivate a more aggressive on-screen persona. In April 2011 Clarkson was accused of having an affair with Phillipa Sage (pictured kissing) while touring Australia, South Africa and Norway with his Top Gear co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May. There was outcry when Clarkson used the word, a derogatory term for people of Asian descent, during the show's two-part Burma special, screened in March last year. In 2013 he came under fire after he allegedly used the n-word in leaked footage while reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'. But he escaped disciplinary action by the BBC with the Complaints and Appeals Board agreeing that the 'incident did not engage editorial standards as the material had not been broadcast'.\n","right_summary":"Frances Clarkson, 53, spend Easter Bank Holiday weekend in Caribbean.

{"document":"A young woman has revealed details about her lengthy battle with a rare condition that left her unable to eat anything for a year and a half \u2013 despite the fact that she still felt desperately hungry. Kyli Wilfson, a self-confessed \u2018food person\u2019, was 26 when she first started experiencing agonizing pain \u2013 which made her feel like she had been \u2018kicked in the abdomen' \u2013 whenever she ate, a symptom which doctors initially brushed off as being due to a mild pancreatic problem which would \u2018resolve itself\u2019 in a matter of days. Kyli, now 29, was eventually diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, and the North Carolina resident found herself looking at a lifetime spent on a feeding tube, as the disease, which effects less than .01 per cent of people, would only get worse. Within months she had dropped to a startling 80lbs, she revealed to\u00a0Cosmopolitan.com, and  had to postpone her wedding as she spent more and more time in hospitals. Mystery illness:\u00a0Kyli Wolfson, pictured, had trouble getting a correct diagnosis when she woke up in excruciating pain in October 2012; her illness left her unable to eat for a year and a half. At first, doctors faced difficulties even diagnosing Kyli; though she'd had digestive problems for years, her rare disease wasn't initially considered. Instead, doctors at her local ER insisted that she had acute pancreatitis, a condition that commonly effects heavy drinkers. However, Kyli's pain continued to return every time she tried to eat anything \u2014 even soup \u2014 leading her to visit two more hospitals in search of a new diagnosis and a cure. 'It never even changed,' she said, explaining that when she tried to eat, it felt like she was burning on the inside. 'It was still ten-out-of-ten pain.' Three months after her first visit to the emergency room, she was finally diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, a condition she had likely had since birth but was only found after doctors put a camera down her throat to her pancreas \u2014 a potentially life-threatening procedure that was only tried after all other options had been exhausted. Literally starving: Still maintaining an appetite but unable to eat without pain, Kyli was constantly hungry \u2014\u00a0leading her\u00a0fianc\u00e9 Dustin Wood to feel bad eating in front of her. Rapid weight loss: Kyli's\u00a0weight, which is normally at around 110lbs, dropped to 80lbs when she was at her lightest. Sufferers of the illness, which is characterized by an inflammation of the pancreas, have to be fed through a feeding tube because the condition never improves, and eventually leads to permanent damage. Kyli spent a year and half abstaining from eating entirely, which was an incredibly trying ordeal for both her and her\u00a0fianc\u00e9 Dustin Wood. 'We're food people,' she said. 'We [love] to bake, order takeout. Now he felt bad eating in front of me.' Luckily, Kyli found a support group for people who have chronic pancreatitis on Facebook, some of whom said they found a way to eat: a risky surgical procedure to remove the pancreas, spleen, gallbladder, appendix, and duodenum, which allows the pancreas' cells to be transplanted into the liver, enabling it to function as a pancreas. So Kyli flew to a hospital in Minnesota that specializes in the 14-hour surgery, and scheduled her procedure for January 2014. Enduring love: Kyli's wedding to\u00a0fianc\u00e9 Dustin is back on, now scheduled three years after she first went to the emergency room with stomach pain. After her surgery, Kyli spent another two and a half weeks using a feeding tube before being told to try food again. 'I was excited, but nervous, since it had been so long since I'd eaten,' she said. 'Sure enough, I had chicken broth and juice and it didn't affect anything. It was amazing.' She soon began enjoying ice cream, lobster, and pizza, and was able to return to her normal weight of 110lbs. 'The number one thing that helped was the support group I joined and knowing other people going through it,' she said. 'They saved me and gave me hope.' Now feeling healthy and grateful for the transformative surgery, Kyli was able to reschedule her wedding to Dustin. She will walk down the aisle in October.\n","right_summary":"Kyli Wolfson, 29, felt severe pain whenever she ate thanks to the disorder, which developed in October 2012, when she was 26.

Diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, Kyli's only hope was to undergo a 14-hour surgery to remove her pancreas.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Kyli Wolfson was unable to eat anything for years due to an unidentified condition but was finally able to eat ice cream, lobster and pizza after getting pancreas transplant."}
{"document":"Manchester City are preparing bids for English trio Raheem Sterling, Ross Barkley and Jay Rodriguez as part of a summer Anglification of their squad. The club are well aware of a lack of homegrown talent at senior level with the departure of Frank Lampard and uncertainty over James Milner's future exacerbating the problem. Etihad Stadium chiefs have moved to address the situation and are expected to lodge offers for Liverpool winger Sterling, Everton midfielder Barkley and Southampton striker Rodriguez. Raheem Sterling would cost in region of \u00a350million but the forward could buy out the final year of his contract. Everton midfielder Ross Barkley has been inconsistent this season but would command a hefty fee. Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez has not played this season but City are monitoring his return from injury. Club bosses believe the young pair on Merseyside, aged 20 and 21, can not only make an impact at fist-team level but can inject youth into an ageing squad. Sterling has refused to sign a new \u00a3100,000-a-week contract at Anfield, with the player and his advisers believing they can get \u00a3150,000 elsewhere. The England flyer is valued at \u00a350m. However, he can buy out the final year of his contract for \u00a31.7m, which may force Liverpool to accept an effectively half-priced bid of \u00a325m. Barkley has had an inconsistent season, summed up by his penalty miss in Saturday's 1-0 win over Burnley, but is still expected to command a hefty fee. City are long-term admirers of Rodriguez, 25, and have been monitoring his comeback from a injury. The Lancashire lad suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury against City and Saints boss Ronald Koeman revealed he could return to action in the final game of the season against the same side. Frank Lampard was one of six homegrown players on their squad list this season, but will leave in the summer. Premier League rules state that clubs must have eight homegrown players in squads of 25. To achieve homegrown status, players born outside the UK can qualify as long as they have been at a club's academy for three years before their 21st birthday. If clubs cannot find eight they have to reduce their squads accordingly. City's list featured six homegrown players this term including Lampard, who will join sister club New York City FC in July and Milner who is still pondering his future. Their contract offer to former Aston Villa and Newcastle United man Milner remains on the table, however, there is interest from Premier League rivals Liverpool and Arsenal and a host of clubs from Italy and Spain. Despite rumours to the contrary, the 29-year-old Yorkshireman is yet to decide where his future lies. England international James Milner is out of contract in the summer and is considering his options. Milner can now speak Spanish after enlisting the help of a private tutor and regularly tests his newly-attained skill out on the likes of Pablo Zabaleta and David Silva, although the arrival of a baby daughter last summer may keep him on home soil. After a poor run of form City, whose Under 18s take on Chelsea in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup Final on Monday night, will not retain their Premier League title and securing a Champions League place is paramount to their plans. Should they fail to do so an under-pressure Pellegrini will face the axe. Despite intense speculation linking outgoing Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp with the post, Pellegrini is expected to see out the final year of his contract should his side finish in the top four.\n","right_summary":"Manchester City will make a\u00a0concerted effort to sign English players.

{"document":"A farmer from eastern China has found himself the talk of the country after one of his goats gave birth to a kid with six legs. The 20-day-old 'spider goat' - as it has been (inaccurately) nicknamed by Chinese web users - was born with four forelegs and two hind legs. Xiao Qibin, owner of the farm, said the baby goat is growing quickly and healthily with 'an extraordinary appetite', the People's Daily Online reports. Rare: This six-legged kid has become a star animal in China since it was born 20 days ago. Mr Xiao started running his goat farm in Chaohu in Anhui Province about a year ago and owns more than 400 goats. 'During the labour, I saw the nanny goat was having difficulty,' said Mr Xiao.

{"document":"Paul Walker is hardly the first actor to die during a production. But Walker's death in November 2013 at the age of 40 after a car crash was especially eerie given his rise to fame in the \"Fast and Furious\" film franchise. The release of \"Furious 7\" on Friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember -- and possibly grieve again -- the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood. \"He was a person of humility, integrity, and compassion,\" military veteran Kyle Upham said in an email to CNN. Walker secretly paid for the engagement ring Upham shopped for with his bride. \"We didn't know him personally but this was apparent in the short time we spent with him. I know that we will never forget him and he will always be someone very special to us,\" said Upham. The actor was on break from filming \"Furious 7\" at the time of the fiery accident, which also claimed the life of the car's driver, Roger Rodas. Producers said early on that they would not kill off Walker's character, Brian O'Connor, a former cop turned road racer. Instead, the script was rewritten and special effects were used to finish scenes, with Walker's brothers, Cody and Caleb, serving as body doubles. There are scenes that will resonate with the audience -- including the ending, in which the filmmakers figured out a touching way to pay tribute to Walker while \"retiring\" his character. At the premiere Wednesday night in Hollywood, Walker's co-star and close friend Vin Diesel gave a tearful speech before the screening, saying \"This movie is more than a movie.\" \"You'll feel it when you see it,\" Diesel said. \"There's something emotional that happens to you, where you walk out of this movie and you appreciate everyone you love because you just never know when the last day is you're gonna see them.\" There have been multiple tributes to Walker leading up to the release. Diesel revealed in an interview with the \"Today\" show that he had named his newborn daughter after Walker. Social media has also been paying homage to the late actor. A week after Walker's death, about 5,000 people attended an outdoor memorial to him in Los Angeles. Most had never met him. Marcus Coleman told CNN he spent almost $1,000 to truck in a banner from Bakersfield for people to sign at the memorial. \"It's like losing a friend or a really close family member ... even though he is an actor and we never really met face to face,\" Coleman said. \"Sitting there, bringing his movies into your house or watching on TV, it's like getting to know somebody. It really, really hurts.\" Walker's younger brother Cody told People magazine that he was initially nervous about how \"Furious 7\" would turn out, but he is happy with the film. \"It's bittersweet, but I think Paul would be proud,\" he said. CNN's Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.\n","right_summary":"\"Furious 7\" pays tribute to star Paul Walker, who died during filming.

{"document":"A prosecutor has dismissed allegations that Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner tried to cover up Iran's involvement in a 1994 bombing in Buenos Aires. The move by prosecutor Javier de Luca to drop the case could mean a definitive end to the accusations that have roiled the nation, according to Argentina's state-run Telam news agency. The case became of high interest globally after the original prosecutor who brought the allegations was found dead in January. Alberto Nisman was found dead days after making the accusations. His death sparked outrage and conspiracy theories aplenty. Nisman alleged that Argentina's government agreed not to go after Iranian suspects in the bombing in exchange for a favorable trade deal. The 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in the Argentine capital is the deadliest terror attack in the country's history. Eighty-five people were killed, and hundreds were injured. A second prosecutor took the reins after Nisman's death and took the case to court in February. A judge dismissed the case, saying that Nisman's allegations did not hold up. Following that, the case went to prosecutor de Luca for a possible appeal. On Monday, de Luca announced that in his investigation he found that \"there was no crime here, either carried out or attempted,\" according to Telam.\n","right_summary":"The prosecutor looking at allegations against Argentina's President says no crime committed.

Spurs are sixth in the Barclays Premier League, which would bring European qualification, but there has been talk in the past that Europe's second-tier competition does them more harm than good. Eriksen says the benefits of qualifying\u00a0outweigh\u00a0the negatives, though, and admits that the prospect of Europa\u00a0League football played a big part when he decided to move to White Hart Lane in 2013. Christian Eriksen has warned Tottenham they will struggle to attract top players if they miss out on Europe. Eriksen says the benefits of qualifying for the much-maligned Europa League outweigh the negatives. The lack of Champions League football - which Spurs have missed out on since the 2010-11 season - is seen as a barrier to signing top-class players for clubs of Tottenham's size, but Eriksen says missing out on the Europa League would have the same effect. 'Is it a factor when the club are trying to sign players? I think so,' Eriksen said. 'It certainly was for me when I moved from Ajax two years ago. 'I always want to play in Europe, to be seen on that stage or in the Premier League. It was a big chance and for me it was a nice thing when I came to Tottenham.' Tottenham have been linked with Marseille midfielder Florian Thauvin and Dynamo Kiev forward Andriy Yarmolenko, and Eriksen worries that Spurs could have to lower their sights if they are not on the European stage next season. Mauricio Pochettino's side currently sit sixth in the Barclays Premier League, which is enough to qualify. Eriksen says the lure of Europa League football was important in his decision to join Spurs back in 2013. And while he admits that missing out makes finishing higher up the table easier, Eriksen doesn't see many issues with the competition itself. 'I'd rather play in Europe than nothing,' he told the Evening Standard. 'There are many games, of course, but if you have a big squad as we have, it shouldn't be a disappointment to play in Europe. A lot of players want to be in Europe. We've been fighting to get into the top four and we still have a little chance. Florian Thauvin (right), the Marseille midfielder, is one player who has been linked with a move to Spurs. Dynamo Kiev's Andriy  Yarmolenko is thought to be another target for Tottenham in the summer market. 'Of course, it is easier to get into the top four if you are not in Europe. There are so many games and we have played more games than most teams in the Premier League this season.' As it stands, the Premier League's top six will all qualify for Europe but if Arsenal win the FA Cup final against Aston Villa that number would extend to the seventh-placed side. West Ham could also find themselves in the Europa League next season if they qualify via the Fair Play Table.\n","right_summary":"Tottenham are sitting sixth in the Premier League after a long season.

{"document":"As the final episodes of Poldark approach, men across the nation have longed for respite from the hysteria over heartthrob Aidan Turner. But the bad news \u2013 for them, at least \u2013 is that any well-earned break won\u2019t last for long. TV chiefs yesterday announced the Cornwall-set drama will be coming back for eight more episodes after it helped BBC1 deliver its strongest start to a year for a decade. Scroll down for video. Fans, rejoice! Aidan Turner has been signed up for a second series of BBC period drama Poldark. BBC1 boss Charlotte Moore confirmed that Turner\u2019s broody Ross would return for another series, alongside actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays love interest \u2013 and now wife \u2013 Demelza. \u2018I can exclusively announce that Sunday night\u2019s new phenomenon Poldark that has captured the nation\u2019s hearts has been commissioned for a second series,\u2019 Mrs Moore said, adding that the series had helped BBC1 to an \u2018outstanding start\u2019 this year. About 8.1million people on average have watched each episode, helping the flagship BBC channel attract more than a quarter of television viewers in evenings, when the battle for attention is most competitive. The series, based on Winston Graham\u2019s novels, follows Ross Poldark after he returns from the American War of Independence only to find that his father has died and his former fianc\u00e9e, Elizabeth, has married another man. There are 12 Poldark books in total, seven of which are set in the 18th century. The other five then follow Poldark\u2019s children through the 19th century. The first series of Poldark, written by Debbie Horsfield, covers the first of Mr Graham\u2019s two novels, named after Ross Poldark and Demelza. Successful role: Aidan has won legions of dedicated fans since stripping off as the swoon-worthy Captain Ross Poldark in the revival of the 1970s TV show. The second series will move on to the third and fourth books, named after their child, Jeremy, and scheming banker George Warleggan. Women up and down the country watched on tenterhooks as Poldark\u2019s affections shifted to his kitchen maid Demelza. But it is the scenes featuring Turner in a state of undress which sent them into the biggest frenzy. Many have taken to Twitter to express their approval whenever he appears without his shirt \u2013 working with a scythe in the fields or swimming naked in the sea. \u2018If Poldark gets any hotter we\u2019ll have to call the fire brigade,\u2019 one viewer commented. The current show, with the sixth episode of eight this weekend, has not reached the popularity of the 1970s adaptation, which brought in 15million viewers. Hard worker: The 31-year-old actor recently admitted that working on his honed physique came as a challenge to him, so he'll have to get back to the gym ahead of the second series. Popular: Poldark has garnered audiences of around 8m every Sunday night.\n","right_summary":"TV chiefs have announced drama Poldark will return for second season.

{"document":"A 17 stone mother who was left red faced after becoming trapped in a fairground ride has shed almost half her body weight after taking to the treadmill. Shauna McGlasson, 25, from Workington, was so overweight she got trapped in the turnstiles at the Alice And Wonderland ride at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in August last year. Shauna, who was a takeaway addict, was carrying her three-year-old daughter Lacey in her arms at the time and the toddler started screaming after her mother tried to free herself. Shauna\u00a0McGlasson was left red faced after becoming trapped in the turnstiles of the Alice and Wonderland ride when she took her daughter Lacey (pictured) to Blackpool Pleasure Beach after ballooning to 17st. It was this embarrassing incident that inspired the mother-of-one to make a dramatic change to her diet and exercise routine losing 7st in as many months. This was the final straw for the full-time mum who had been left battling depression and anxiety after gorging on fast-food and ballooning to 17 stone. Determined Shauna has since dropped seven stone and now weighs in at just over 10 stone. Shauna made fast progress as she began to eat healthily, she lost four stone in as many months reaching 13st by December, 2014. She then hit the gym and shifted another three stone and has started a new relationship with boyfriend Curtis Grayson, 21. Before shedding the weight Shauna battled with depression because of her size. And 5ft 2in Shauna insists she's never been happier. She says if she had not got stuck in that ride her life would never have changed for the better. 'I was addicted to takeaways and I've never felt so low,' she said. 'When we got to go through to the ride I got stuck in the turnstile and Lacey started crying. 'Everyone was looking at me and I felt so humiliated so I had to do something about it. 'You can see in the photo taken when I finally got out just how upset Lacey is.' Shauna swapped her daily treats of chips and pizza for a high protein diet of chicken and fish. Shauna is now a regular at the gym going up to five times a week with running being her workout of choice. Before her weight loss Shauna would feast on fish and chips on the daily as well as donner meat pizzas but has now traded them in for a 1,500 calorie-a-day diet of chicken and fish. As well as her change in diet Shauna heads to the Energize ladies gym in Workington for an hour a day, up to five times a week, tackling the treadmill and the cross-trainer in her bid to keep fit. Shauna says that it was taking to the treadmill that really helped her to shift her extra pounds. 'I look at the pants I used to wear and they are like a tent - and they used to be tight, I could barely get into them,' she said. Shauna is now more confident than ever and is even prepared to take Lacey swimming. 'I can't believe I used to wear stuff that big. But I started walking on the treadmill at first and I've gradually got faster until the point that I was running and it's made a big difference.' And the change has boosted her confidence so much that she is prepared to even take Lacey swimming for the first time. Shauna said: 'I've never been able to take Lacey swimming before because I've been too conscious of my body to wear a swimsuit. 'I'm excited to finally take her to the pool. 'I don't think she's noticed the difference in me as she sees me everyday but I'm so much happier and much more active now. I feel great.'\n","right_summary":"Shauna McGlasson became trapped in the turnstiles of a fairground ride. Determined to make a change she swapped takeaways for the gym.

{"document":"Researchers plan to drill 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) below the surface of the Chicxulub crater in Mexico to try and answer the question of how the dinosaurs died out. The core they hope to retrieve will allow them to look back in time 10 million to 15 million years into the past. It could help uncover exactly what happened to create the crater - and if it killed off the dinosaurs. UK researchers studied the asteroid impact 66 million years ago (illustration shown). They found the heat near the impact site in Mexico was not intense enough to ignite plant material. A heat pulse lasted less than a minute, too short to set plants alight. The impact site is believed to be the 125 mile (200km) wide Chicxulub crater buried underneath the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. When the six-mile-wide (10km) asteroid hit what is now Mexico approximately 66 million years ago, dinosaurs were experiencing environmental upheaval, which left them vulnerable. Previous researcher has questioned the theory\u00a0that a global firestorm accompanied the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs. A team of researchers has found that heat near the impact site would not have been sufficient to ignite plants. It suggests our understanding of the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs may not be as complete as thought. 'The Chicxulub impact crater has been a remarkable scientific opportunity for the 20 years since it's been discovered,' Sean Gulick, of The University of Texas at Austin Institute for Geophysics, told Livescience. An international team of scientists met last week in M\u00e9rida, Mexico, located within the 125-mile-wide (200 kilometers) Chicxulub crater, to discuss their plans for the drilling project, slated to start in spring 2016. They believe that when a big rock smashes into Earth at high enough velocities, the collision causes the crust temporarily to act like a liquid, first forming a so-called transient crater (like the indentation that forms on a lake surface after a rock is thrown in), and the center rebounds, or splashes, upward and then outward. 'We think the peak ring is the record of the material that rebounded and splashed outward,' Gulick told Live Science. All of these ideas are based on models and aren't necessarily what happened. 'We've never gotten a rock back from a peak ring to know if that's correct,' Gulick said. Previous researcher has questioned the theory\u00a0that a global firestorm accompanied the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs. A team of researchers has found that heat near the impact site would not have been sufficient to ignite plants. It suggests our understanding of the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs may not be as complete as thought. The team of researchers from the University of Exeter, University of Edinburgh and Imperial College London recreated the immense energy that would have been released from the asteroid impact 66 million years ago. Further away from the impact site in Mexico (shown), in places like New Zealand, the heat could have lasted up to seven minutes and caused some localised fires. But the theory that a global firestorm accompanied the asteroid impact is not correct, according to the scientists. They found that the intense but short-lived heat near the impact site could not have ignited live plants, challenging the idea that the impact led to global firestorms. These firestorms have previously been considered a major contender in the puzzle to find out what caused the mass extinction of life on Earth 66 million years ago. The impact site is believed to be the 125 mile (200km) wide Chicxulub crater buried underneath the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. Researchers believe that when a big rock smashes into Earth at high enough velocities, the collision causes the crust temporarily to act like a liquid, first forming a so-called transient crater (like the indentation that forms on a lake surface after a rock is thrown in), and the center rebounds, or splashes, upward and then outward. For years scientists have debated whether an asteroid, climate change or a combination of catastrophes were responsible for the demise of dinosaurs. But last year, a study claimed that the majority of the prehistoric creatures were wiped out by a perfect storm of 'colossal bad luck'. Dinosaurs might have survived the asteroid strike that led to their extinction if it had come slightly earlier or later in history, scientists said. But when the six-mile-wide (10km) asteroid hit what is now Mexico approximately 66 million years ago, dinosaurs were experiencing environmental upheaval, which left them vulnerable. The study by an international team of palaeontologists led by the University of Edinburgh looked at an updated catalogue of dinosaur fossils, mostly from North America. They found that widespread volcanic activity, changing sea levels and varying temperatures had weakened the dinosaurs' food chain when disaster struck. If the asteroid impact had come a few million years earlier, when the range of species was bigger and food chains more robust, they may have survived, according to the study. A heat pulse in the surrounding the area lasted for less than a minute followed the impact. While this was too short to ignite live plant material nearby, the effects of the impact further away could have been sufficient to set some material alight. The researchers said as far away as New Zealand, the heat would have been less intense but longer lasting, heating the ground for seven minutes - enough to ignite live plant matter. But nearer the site such a scenario was unlikely, pouring water on the global firestorm theory. The experiments carried out in the laboratory showed that dry plant matter could ignite, but live plants including green pine branches, typically do not. 'By combining computer simulations of the impact with methods from engineering we have been able to recreate the enormous heat of the impact in the laboratory,' said\u00a0Dr Claire Belcher from the Earth System Science group in Geography at the University of Exeter. 'This has shown us that the heat was more likely to severely affect ecosystems a long distance away, such that forests in New Zealand would have had more chance of suffering major wildfires than forests in North America that were close to the impact. 'This flips our understanding of the effects of the impact on its head and means that paleontologists may need to look for new clues from fossils found a long way from the impact to better understand the mass extinction event.' The experiments carried out in the laboratory showed that dry plant matter could ignite, but live plants typically do not. Pictured\u00a0is the fire propagation apparatus recreating the impact induced thermal pulse at the Cretaceous-Palaeogene (K-Pg) boundary. Halogen lamps are delivering the thermal radiation in the image. Plants and animals are generally resistant to localised fire events - animals can hide or hibernate and plants can re-colonise from other areas, implying that wildfires are unlikely to be directly capable of leading to the extinctions. If, however, some animal communities - particularly large animals - were unable to shelter from the heat, they may have suffered serious losses. It is unclear whether these would have been sufficient to lead to the extinction of species. 'This is a truly exciting piece of inter-disciplinary research,' said Dr Rory Hadden from the University of Edinburgh. 'By working together engineers and geoscientists have tackled a complex, long-standing problem in a novel way. 'This has allowed a step forward in the debate surrounding the end Cretaceous impact and will help Geoscientists interpret the fossil record and evaluate potential future impacts. 'In addition, the methods we developed in the laboratory for this research have driven new developments in our current understanding of how materials behave in fires particularly at the wildland-urban-interface, meaning that we have been able to answer questions relating to both ancient mass extinctions at the same time as developing understanding of the impact of wildfires in urban areas today.'\n","right_summary":"UK researchers studied the asteroid impact 66 million years ago. 125-mile-wide (200 kilometers) Chicxulub crater created by an asteroid.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Scientists plan to drill 5,000 feet below the Chicxulub crater in Mexico to retrieve a core that will help uncover the truth behind the extinction of dinosaurs.

{"document":"A mother says she has been left 'devastated' after her daughter failed to get a place at the same primary school her three brothers attend. Joanne Whitehouse, 44, had applied for her four-year-old daughter Alice to go to St John Fisher's RC Primary School in Middleton near Rochdale as her only preference. Her sons Joel, nine, Harri, seven, and Ollie, six, already attend the school and she believed there would be 'no issue' with her daughter gaining a place. Joanne Whitehouse (centre) was left 'devastated' after finding out her daughter Alice (right) and granddaughter Olivia (left) won't be able to go to the same school as her three sons. Alice pictured with her brothers, Joel, nine, (second left) Harri, seven, \u00a0(right) and Ollie, six (far left) But when the school allocations were revealed this morning she found out her youngest would have to go to a different school, which is a 20 minute walk from her other children's. Ms Whitehouse's granddaughter Olivia, who is also four, also missed out on a place at the school and will have to attend\u00a0Middleton Parish C of E Primary School with Alice. The mother-of-eight, from Middleton, Greater Manchester, was told there were 82 applications for just 30 places at the school this year. She is planning to appeal Rochdale Council's decision and says: 'I can't split myself in half and be at both schools at the same time. 'Alice's brothers go to the school. So it just makes sense for Alice and Oliva to go there as well. I just don't know what I'm going to do.' Ms Whitehouse added she is concerned there will be a delay in arranging a care plan for Alice, who has Type 1 diabetes and needs four daily insulin injections, while she awaits the appeal outcome. One in ten children across Greater Manchester missed out on their first choice of school when the allocations were announced this morning.

{"document":"If anyone can be relied upon to crack a smile in the sometimes overly straight-faced world of professional football, it is lofty Stoke striker Peter Crouch. That is, until somebody tries to imitate his now trademark goal celebrations. Speaking on Sky's Soccer AM, the 34-year-old front man gave an in-depth analysis on where it all went 'horribly wrong' for Potters team-mate Charlie Adam following his wonder strike against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last Saturday. Charlie Adam (second right) celebrates his stunning goal against Chelsea with his Stoke team-mates. Peter Crouch was at hand to give his verdict on Adam's dancing skills on Sky's Soccer AM chat show. Crouch originally brought the robot celebration into prominence for England against Jamaica in 2006. And Crouch was a more than qualified judge for the verdict, as it was his famed robot celebration from England's 6-0 against Jamaica ahead of the 2006 World Cup that got the revival treatment from his Potters pal. After appearing on the long-running football chat show the previous weekend, Adam was asked by hosts Helen Chamberlain and Max Rushden to 'do the robot' if he netted against Jose Mourinho's Premier League high-flyers. After smashing home Stoke's equaliser from 65-yards over the head of Blues goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, the former Liverpool midfielder ran to the touchline to greet Crouch, who started on the bench during the 2-1 loss for Mark Hughes' men. The former England striker even went as far as to highlight where Adam was going wrong. The former Liverpool and Tottenham striker was less than impressed with Adam's efforts to imitate him. 'Obviously we're all in agreement it's a fantastic strike from Charlie Adam,' Crouch admitted. Less impressed with his post-strike antics, Crouch's critique on his Britannia Stadium colleague pulled no punches. 'He goes into the celebration far too quickly. No warm up.' 'As you can see he's not got his arm in the 90 degree angle that a robot should start. 'The arms, the shoulders are all coming over in the wrong direction and he just needs to needs to be a bit looser.' 'It's a real shame, because obviously he's got genuine intent and love for the robot, but he's just got a lot of it wrong.' We'll look forward to seeing Crouch show us all how it's done when he's next on the score sheet. Adam (centre) re-enacted Crouch's celebration after letting fly from inside his own half against Chelsea. Thibaut Courtois was not out of position, but he couldn't do anything about Adam's sublime strike. Adam's audacious effort was clocked at more than 45 miles per hour and came from inside his own half.\n","right_summary":"Peter Crouch analysed Charlie Adam's robot celebration against Chelsea. The midfielder scored from his own half at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Adam followed his goal with a light-hearted ode to his Stoke team-mate. The Scot was asked to perform the act by Sky's\u00a0Soccer AM presenters. Crouch made the celebration famous whilst playing for England in 2006.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Peter Crouch criticizes Charlie Adam's robot celebration after scoring a goal against Chelsea.

{"document":"Probably the most extraordinary thing about the island of St Helena is that it was ever found at all. A tiny ten by six mile speck in the South Atlantic 1,200 miles from the coast of West Africa, it lay undiscovered for around 14 million years able to evolve its own unique flora and fauna untouched by the outside world. But almost from the moment Portuguese explorer Juan de Nova was blown there by the Trade Winds in 1502 it assumed an importance out of all proportion to its size. Jamestown is the capital of the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, discovered by in 1502 by Juan de Nova. It was a key stopping place for the ships of the East India Company and other vessels - at its peak it serviced a thousand a year. It played a role in both slavery and its abolition: when the trade became illegal it was the base from which the British sought to capture the perpetrators and free their human cargo. And it was the place to which Napoleon was exiled after his defeat at Waterloo. The emperor who had escaped Elba was not going to get away so easily from the most isolated place on earth. Framed by cragged volcanic cliffs soaring 800 metres (2,600 feet) above sea level, the island is just 122 square kilometres in total. The island, which is smaller than central Paris has just 4,200 inhabitants - and 850 of them live in the small capital of Jamestown. Early next year a \u00a3218m airport will open and make this British Overseas Territory no longer quite so isolated. At the moment though the only way to get there is still by sea and for most that means the RMS St. Helena. This Royal Mail Ship is the island\u2019s lifeline.\u00a0It carries in all its supplies and up to 150 passengers who range from returning or departing Saints (as the residents are known) to tourists with a taste for something different as well as, more recently, construction workers, entrepreneurs and conservation experts. Early next year, an airport will open on the island. The \u00a3218 million project will make this British Overseas Territory far more accessible. Once the airport is open in February 2016, the ship service - which takes five days from Cape Town - will be retired. Here, the runway of the future airport is visible. The upcoming airport will be located in the Prosperous Bay Plain area of the island. This means it\u2019s a ship of two halves: the front laden with dozens of huge containers, the back a sun deck where we take dips in the little swimming pool and play quoits, shuffleboard, skittles and passengers v. crew cricket. In between are a couple of lounges with bars where travellers can listen to talks and watch films. These are not compulsory, of course, and many of the Saints for whom the voyage is basically just a bus service sit and watch benignly. For the rest of us they\u2019re a wonderful ice-breaker and a source of great fun and fierce rivalry: passions are running particularly high by the final of the three night accumulator quiz. As it stands, the only way to reach Saint Helena is via ship - the RMS St. Helena, a Royal Mail Ship that transports all supplies to the island. Traveller Liz Gill describes the ship as a 'ship of two halves': the front laden with dozens of huge containers, with a sundeck out back. We are fortified in all this by the most enormous hearty meals: there\u2019s even an extra savoury course after the cheese at dinner though I never get that far myself. Sailing on the St. Helena has been like stepping back in time. Captain Rodney Young himself tells me that sometimes he surveys the deck and thinks this is still a bit of Empire on which the sun has not yet set. For me at times though it seems even further back and I think a lot about all those ancient mariners crossing this vast ocean where in a ten-day round trip we sight only two other ships and even the wandering albatrosses say goodbye after a couple of days. It\u2019s good preparation for the island itself which emerges from the waves at dawn like a dream. There is in fact something rather Alice-in-Wonderland-ish about St Helena as if everything has shrunken to produce a geography and a society in miniature. The edge of the runway will offer spectacular views of the blue water, nestled among the jagged rocks of the coastline. While visiting, Liz climbed the island's infamous Jacob\u2019s Ladder: a 699-step staircase that towers 600 feet in the air. So within only 47 square miles of land mass there are barren deserts and lush cloud forests, a black sand beach and towering crags, rolling pastureland and peaks of up to 2,700 feet. On a central ridge it\u2019s possible to look in one direction on the empty moonscape of Sandy Bay and in another on sheep scattered fields which could be in Sussex. Similarly in human terms for a population of 4,000, barely the size of an English village, there is a governor, a legislative council, a hospital, three primary and one secondary school, a cathedral with a bishop plus places of worship for several different denominations, a police force, a prison, two newspapers and two radio stations. What this means for the visitor is a wide range of activities. I seemed to fill almost every hour of the nine days I spent there while the ship sailed on to Ascension Island and back. Despite being barely the size of an English village, the capital boasts a legislative council, several schools and two newspapers. Two were spent walking: there are lots of trails graded in difficulty and many routes have \u2018post boxes\u2019 which hold visitors books and rubber stamps. One day we climbed Diana\u2019s Peak in the company of David Pryce, a mine-of-information Englishman known locally as The Bug Man who is on a three year project to catalogue the local invertebrates. On another we walked with a young Saint Aaron Legg to Lot\u2019s Wife\u2019s Ponds, Lot and his wife being giant geological features and the pool being a serene inlet protected by rocks from the crashing waves beyond and filled with colourful fish. The walk was an hour\u2019s climb up a steep rocky hillside and half an hour\u2019s descent down the other side ending in having to slither down a rope for the last 30 feet but more than worth it. It was one of the loveliest places where I have ever swum. Marine life is a big attractions for snorkelers and divers \u2013 there are also several wrecks to explore \u2013 and fishermen who can chase tuna, wahoo and marlin. We were too late for the seasonal visit of whale sharks but 200 dolphins did their best to compensate, cavorting around our boat as we sailed out to the seabird colonies. I also had an enchanting afternoon watching wirebirds, the island\u2019s only endemic bird so called because of its spindly legs and something of a conservation success story. The island is full of trails - of varying levels of difficulty - as well as fabulous swimming and diving opportunities. As well as there being several ship wrecks to explore, the marine life is another major draw for snorkellers and divers alike. By contrast there was a Napoleon themed day: a visit to Briars Pavilion where he stayed briefly when he first arrived, Longwood House where he lived for six years until his death in 1821 and his tomb in the pretty valley setting he chose himself. Though his body was repatriated to France 19 years later and much of Longwood\u2019s contents like the clothes and the death masks are replicas, the places are still resonant if melancholy. And it\u2019s not every day one can stand on the exact spot where an emperor passed away.. Other experiences included a cookery lesson making tuna fishcakes, pumpkin stew and pilau \u2013 pronounced plo \u2013 a spicy legacy of St Helena\u2019s diversity, which its people made up from arrivals from India, China, Madagascar, Britain and West Africa. There were also visits to the \u2018world\u2019s remotest distillery\u2019 run by ex-pat Brit Paul Heckling who produces among other drinks a spirit called tungi made from prickly pear and\u2019 the world\u2019s remotest coffee plantation\u2019 run by another ex-pat Bill Bolton who decided to revive the Bourbon Arabica bushes originally brought over from Yemen in 1732. Saint Helena is also home to the 'world's most remote distillery' and the 'world's remotest coffee plantation,' both run by British ex-pats. Then there was the small but excellent museum, the forts, batteries and cannons dotted around the place, the fine collection of St Helena prints and drawings at Prince\u2019s Lodge (in pre-photography days ships had their own artists on board) , the Boer cemetery (6,000 were imprisoned here during the Boer War but given freedom to work, trade and organise events) and the Plantation House grounds to see Jonathan the tortoise who is at least 182 years old and probably the world\u2019s oldest reptile. And finally I did what any self-respecting visitor has to do and climbed Jacob\u2019s Ladder. Once a tramway for hauling goods up the cliff side in the capital Jamestown this is now a terrifyingly steep 600 ft high staircase of 699 steps. Not wanting to risk passing out halfway up, I took it very slowly, pausing every 50 steps and reaching the top in 28 minutes. I was pretty puffed up with pride but quickly deflated when I learned the record stands at 5 minutes 11 seconds.

{"document":"Of all the people to be wary of getting caught on camera doing something incredulous, you would think a TV news reporter would know better. But Britt McHenry, a Washington D.C.-based sports reporter for ESPN, has been suspended from her position after an ugly and offensive rant she unleashed on a hapless tow truck company employee surfaced online this week. The 28-year-old, who hails from New Jersey, had her car towed from the parking lot of a Chinese restaurant in Arlington, Virginia, and the verbal attack was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office. 'I\u2019m in the news, sweetheart, I will f-----g sue this place,' McHenry can he heard saying in the video. Vicious: ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry has been suspended for one week and could face further punishment after video surfaced of her berating an Advanced Towing employee in Arlington, Virginia.

The incident occurred on April 6. The parking attendant can be heard in the video warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. 'That\u2019s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this,' McHenry responds. 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' The parking attendant patiently replies: 'Well lets get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money\u2026with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' She's outta there: ESPN immediately responded by suspending McHenry, but only for one week. After a few more comments, including telling the woman she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos' I'm on television and you're in a f-----g trailer, honey.' Finally, before walking away, McHenry says: 'Lose some weight, baby girl.' Unhappy customer: Britt McHenry leaving the towing company and flipping the bird to the cameras. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?': McHenry, who has impeccable grooming when on-camera, berated the woman for her appearance and her job. Video of the shocking scene was obtained by Live Leak. As the video spread online, ESPN were forced to react. A spokesman confirmed McHenry had been suspended, however only for one week. It is unclear whether a more serious punishment will be handed down. Right after the incident took place, McHenry took her Twitter account to rant about how Adanced Towing is 'corrupt'. Not surprisingly, she has since deleted the tweet. The apology: McHenry offered up this note as the video of her awful attack spread online Thursday. Do as I say, not as I do: McHenry's words of wisdom earlier this year. On Thursday, she turned to social media again to apologize for her actions, saying it was an 'intense and stressful moment' for her. She posted online: \u00a0'In an intense and stressful moment, I allowed my emotions to get the best of me and said some insulting and regrettable things. As frustrated as I was, I should always choose to be respectful and take the high road. I am so sorry for my actions and will learn from this mistake.'

{"document":"(The Hollywood Reporter)It may be time to light the lights. ABC is filming a proof of concept for a revival of \"The Muppets,\" The Hollywood Reporter has learned. \"The Big Bang Theory\" co-creator Bill Prady is co-writing the script for a pilot presentation that sources say could be unspooled at May's upfront presentation to Madison Avenue advertisers. Sources tell THR that the project, if all goes well, could go straight to series. Bob Kushell (\"Anger Management,\" \"3rd Rock From the Sun\") will also co-write and is attached to serve as showrunner, with Wilfred's Randall Einhorn attached to exec produce and direct the presentation. ABC's \"Muppets\" revival is being produced by ABC Studios and The Muppet Studios, which Disney owns. The presentation is set to film next weekend on the Disney lot in Burbank with some of the original Muppet performers returning. Sources say the concept for the presentation includes the regular cast of characters created by Jim Henson \u2014 Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and Animal, among others \u2014 gathering at ABC Studios for a meeting about the new \"Muppet Show.\" However, the show won't move forward unless Miss Piggy signs on, and her current relationship with frequent love Kermit is on the rocks, preventing the show from getting off the ground. Early plans call for two celebrity cameos \u2014 including Miss Piggy's current co-star \u2014 as well as new roles including Fozzie's girlfriend and her parents. For Prady, the revived \"Muppets\" \u2014 which landed at ABC after initial interest from Netflix \u2014 marks a return to his roots. The producer, who currently does not have an overall deal, started his career working for Henson in 1982 and ultimately started writing for \"The Jim Henson Hour,\" remaining on the series until a year after Henson's death in 1990. This marks the second time Prady has attempted to revive \"The Muppets.\" The writer-producer shot some test footage before CBS' \"The Big Bang Theory\" that Disney ultimately passed on. For his part, Prady earned an Emmy nomination in 1991 for writing tribute \"The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson\" in 1990 and has contributed writing to Disney's Muppet-themed attractions. Should ABC order \"Muppets\" to series, Prady would juggle both that project and CBS' \"The Big Bang Theory,\" which he exec produces. Created in 1955 by Henson, the original Muppet characters appeared on \"Sam and Friends\" from 1955-61 before going on to appear on late-night talk shows and commercials and becoming a regular part of \"Sesame Street\" in 1969. \"The Muppet Show\" launched on its own as a comedy-variety series and ran from 1976-81, with Kermit serving as the de-facto showrunner on the syndicated series that was produced out of the U.K. The franchise has spawned multiple movies (1979's \"The Muppet Movie,\" 1981's \"The Great Muppet Caper,\" 1984's \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\") as well as NBC's 1989 series \"The Jim Henson Hour.\" Following Henson's death, the franchise continued with \"Muppets Tonight\" airing on ABC in 1996 with reruns airing on sibling Disney Channel from 1997-2000. That was the last television series to feature the Muppets characters. On the feature side, the franchise featured 1992's \"The Muppet Christmas Carol,\" 1996's \"Muppet Treasure Island\" and 1999's \"Muppets From Space,\" the latter two of which were co-produced by Disney, who acquired rights to the Muppets in 2004 and formed The Muppets Studio. The company rebranded the franchise in 2008 with Jason Segel's \"The Muppets,\" with an eighth feature in the franchise, \"Muppets Most Wanted\" bowing in 2014. For ABC, the Muppets revival comes as variety shows are in the midst of a resurgence on the broadcast networks. NBC has made the format a priority, unspooling Marlon Wayans-hosted celebrity variety series \"I Can Do That!\" in the summer and has Neil Patrick Harris entry \"Saturday Night Takeaway\" in the works. The decision to revive \"The Muppets\" also comes as remakes and reboots are having their moment in the sun on the small-screen, as broadcast networks look to fan bases for existing franchises to help cut through the clutter and draw eyeballs in an increasingly crowded scripted space. On the comedy side, \"The Muppets\" arrives as it has become increasingly challenging to launch original scripted half-hours. Prady is repped by Rothman Brecher and Lichter Grossman; Kushell is with ICM Partners; Einhorn is with WME, Odenkirk Provissiero and Bloom Hergott. \u00a92015 The Hollywood Reporter.

{"document":"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini is braced for a ferocious derby clash at Old Trafford this weekend. The fading Barclays Premier League champions take on Manchester United on Sunday having unexpectedly fallen behind their arch-rivals in the table. For most of the season City, if not looking like mounting the strongest of title defences, at least seemed destined for a top-two finish. Manuel Pellegrini is relishing the prospect of taking on Manchester United with Manchester City on Sunday. David Silva (centre) leaves the pitch looking despondent after City's 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace on Monday. Sergio Aguero (centre) is blocked out by Damien Delaney (left) and James McArthur of Palace. That is now far from certain following a dramatic slump in fortunes while United, ordinary for much of the campaign, appear to have clicked into gear in the last month. With just a point separating them in third and fourth, the stage is set for a battle of high intensity. Pellegrini said: 'It is difficult to have a more intense match than you have in the Premier League every week but of course you add a little bit more for a derby of the city. Both teams want to win. 'It is important to be the winning team in the city - that gives an extra plus for the game, not only intensity is better but quality. 'Both teams have very good players and both managers like to play an attacking system so I hope (for a good game for) the fans, for whom you play, and after that I hope we can win.' City have held the edge over United in recent contests and could register a fifth successive derby win for the first time in their history with victory this weekend. A win would also see them become the first club to beat United five times in a row in the Premier League. United had the last laugh over City after the first of their current sequence of derby wins by winning the league in 2013 but since then the blues have had the bragging rights. Pellegrini said: 'I think that they have a lot of respect for our team because last year it was the team that dominated not only the derby but I think we dominated also the Premier League. It is not easy for a team. 'In the last three years we won two and in the other we were runner-up. This year we have been runner-up the whole year. 'We have to play seven games more and we will see what happens at the end of the season and in which position we will stay, but I think for them, they must try to beat the team that has been better in the last few years.' City are likely to come up against an altogether different opponent than the Crystal Palace side that frustrated them last Monday. Louis van Gaal's United have been fluid of late, winning impressively against Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa to take their run of victories to five. Facing a side that is not inclined to sit back could suit City but Pellegrini is dismissive of suggestions that might make it easier than in their most recent away losses at Palace and Burnley. The Chilean said: 'You never know but I don't think it will be easy. It will be different. 'United are a big team that like to play - especially with Van Gaal. He's always an attacking manager. We hope we will see a good game. 'We have a different problem, we have to make sure we don't make mistakes because they have important and technically very good players.' Despite a wretched run of just four league wins in 11 games since pulling level at the top with Chelsea on New Year's Day, Pellegrini maintains all possibilities remain open to his side. City boss Pellegrini remains positive about City's achievements this season despite dropping down to fourth. Vincent Kompany is an injury doubt for Manchester City's clash against Manchester United on Sunday. 'I never think in a negative way,' said the 61-year-old, who will await the outcome of a fitness test on captain Vincent Kompany's hamstring injury. 'I don't think of one, two or three points difference when you have to play seven games. 'When you have mathematical options in football you must never give up and always believe you can do it.'\n","right_summary":"Manchester City are in fourth, a point behind rivals Manchester United.

All we can do, all you can do is make the best choice.\" Bruck told jurors there are only two punishments for them to choose from: death, or life in prison without any possibility of parole. \"We are asking you to punish Jahar by imprisoning him for the rest of his life.\" Showing the court a photo of the federal Supermax prison in Colorado, Bruck said:. \"This is where the government keeps other terrorists who used to be famous but aren't anymore. ... He goes here and he's forgotten. No more spotlight, like the death penalty brings. \"No interviews with the news media, no autobiography, no messages from Jahar on the Internet. No nothing. \"No martyrdom. Just years and years of punishment, day after day, as he grows up to deal with the lonely struggle of dealing with what he did. \"The evidence will show that if you sentence Jahar to a lifetime of thinking about what he did, you'll both punish him and protect society.\" Tsarnaev, 21, was convicted this month of all 30 counts against him; 17 of those counts carry the death penalty for the murders of four -- Krystle Campbell, 29; Lingzi Lu, 23; Martin Richard, 8; and Sean Collier, 26. In deciding whether the former college student is executed for his crimes or spends the rest of his days in a high-security federal prison, jurors must weigh the heinousness of his crime and the toll on his victims against so-called mitigating factors, such as his relative youth, mental health and family background, and whether or not he is remorseful. He has shown no emotion as he sits in court, and he has avoided eye contact with maimed bombing survivors and relatives of the dead. Last week, federal prosecutors presented three days of gut-wrenching victim impact testimony, including an array of images showing the victims as happy, active people and edited videos that added a soundtrack featuring a loud explosion, screams and panicked voices to the horrific bombing scene outside the Forum restaurant, where Richard and Lu died. Lead defense attorney Judy Clarke -- a nationally known death penalty opponent -- has acknowledged that Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, set off the bombs and shot MIT campus cop Collier. But she is expected to build a narrative showing her client as a puppet of his dominant older brother. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was 26, died in a gunbattle with Watertown, Massachusetts, police three days after the bombings. Clarke's colleague, Bruck, began that narrative in his opening statement by noting, \"The man who conceived, planned and led this crime is beyond our power to punish. Only the 19-year-old younger brother who helped is left. \"He was 19, nearly 20. But he was still at an age still legally too young to buy a beer. And an age when people make horribly bad, destructive decisions. What each of you will have to decide for yourself is how to weigh his young age as a mitigating factor.\" Bruck tried to use a photo prosecutors introduced last week -- showing Tsarnaev raising his middle finger at a surveillance camera in his federal courthouse cell -- to make his point. \"I could almost hear you gasp\" when that photo was displayed between images of bombing victims, Bruck said. \"It turned out that shocking gesture wasn't quite as advertised. \"What did he mean? It meant he was acting as an immature 19-year-old.\" Several members of Tsarnaev's family arrived in Boston over the weekend, but the defense is closely guarding its witness list. The relatives, who are at an undisclosed location after being forced to leave a suburban hotel, apparently do not include his parents, who divorced and returned to Dagestan before the April 15, 2013, bombings. Court filings indicate that the defense plans to call expert witness Janet Vogelsang, a sociologist, to explain Tsarnaev's difficult upbringing as the overlooked child of immigrants -- displaced Russian Muslims whose American dream failed. Under federal law, the jury's decision must be unanimous. A deadlocked jury would result in an automatic life sentence for Tsarnaev -- which means the defense only needs to convince one juror to spare his life. The Boston Globe reported over the weekend that fewer than 20% of those polled in Massachusetts favor the death penalty for Tsarnaev. The number is down substantially since the days after the bombings.\n","right_summary":"Defense expected to show Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as a puppet of his dominant older brother.

{"document":"Matthew Hall, 25, climbed onto the balconies in of his victims in Manchester's fashionable Northern Quarter district and hid. A fantasist prowler who harassed young women, traumatising them after scaling the walls of trendy apartment blocks where they lived, has been banned from the area nearby for five years. Matthew Hall, 25, climbed onto the balconies in \u00a0of his victims in Manchester's fashionable Northern Quarter district\u00a0and hid, asking when confronted 'am I scaring you?' and 'you're dead sexy - can I come in?' In one case he walked into his victim's bedroom as she slept in the early hours, making off when she switched the light on and saw him. Hall now risks arrest if he enters the area, where each of his terrified victims lived, at any time in the next five years. Jailing him for two years after he admitted two attempted burglaries and one burglary, Judge Martin Rudland said he had 'deliberately targeted vulnerable women' scaling the walls of buildings 'like a cat burglar of old' in a series of 'highly suspicious offences'. Hall stole nothing from the victims. Making the order prohibiting Hall from 'the area known as the Northern Quarter', bordered by Shudehill, Church Street, Dale Street and Newton Street, Judge Martin Rudland said 'we need to protect the occupants of flats.' In the first offence, on June 16, a teenager, who has been left traumatised by her ordeal, spotted Hall hiding behind a clothes maiden on a balcony of a first floor flat at Silver Jubilee Walk, off Oak Street. When she asked him what he was doing, he sat up and 'appeared scared', telling her: 'Don't phone the police, you don't need to be scared of me. I'm just hiding.' He then lied that police were chasing him, the court heard. The victim led him to the front door but a short time later, having returned to her bedroom, saw him again on the balcony. Hall, of Farnborough Road, Miles Platting, has 45 offences on record for dishonesty, violence and breaches. She angrily approached him and he burst into tears, giving her a false name, before climbing down from the balcony. On June 28 a young woman at Vantage Quay, Brewer Street was watching TV at 3am when Hall climbed onto her ground floor balcony. In a ten minute ordeal he twice engaged her in conversation by banging on the window and claiming to have been chased. He told her a false name and repeatedly asked her, 'am I scaring you?', quizzed her about whether she lived alone, and told her she was 'dead sexy', before asking if he could come in. Balconies of the kind Hall scaled in\u00a0Manchester's Northern Quarter district when terrorising his victims. He has been banned from the fashionable Northern Quarter district (pictured) for the safety of its residents. Police attended after she called officers from behind a locked door, but twenty minutes after they left she spotted him on another balcony. On July 2, Hall returned to Silver Jubilee Walk and walked into another young woman's home via the balcony. She was woken in the early hours after he walked into her bedroom before fleeing. Hall, of Farnborough Road, Miles Platting, has 45 offences on his record for dishonesty, violence and breaches.\n","right_summary":"Matthew Hall, 25, from Manchester got off on\u00a0terrorising\u00a0female\u00a0victims.

{"document":"The fashion designer who created Qantas uniforms modelled by Miranda Kerr will now turn his talents to redesigning the attire for the airline's pilots. Melbourne-born, Paris-based Martin Grant will refresh the uniforms worn by Qantas' domestic and international pilots which have not been changed for more than a decade. A key focus of the redesign will be the female uniform, with CEO Alan Joyce saying there are an increasing number of women joining the ranks of Qantas pilots. Melbourne-born, Paris-based designer Martin Grant (centre) will refresh the uniforms worn by Qantas' domestic and international pilots. He is pictured here with crew wearing the current dress. The fashion designer also created new Qantas uniforms for cabin crew in 2013, modelled by Miranda Kerr. The Qantas uniform has evolved considerably since the 1930s (left). Pictured right is a pilot in the 1980s. 'A key part of the design process will be asking our pilots what they would like to see in the new design,' Mr Joyce said. 'It's important that our crew feel proud to wear the Qantas uniform around the world, every day. 'They represent the national carrier so we want them to feel confident and comfortable sitting in the flight deck, standing in the cabin or walking through an airport.' Mr Grant \u2013 who has more than 30 years' experience working as a in the fashion industry \u2013 will spend time talking to pilots, travelling with them and sitting in a flight simulator before he begins to design the new uniforms. 'Early feedback from Qantas pilots is that they want to retain the traditional image but give it a modern makeover to be more elegant and more wearable,' he said. This image was taken in 1935,\u00a0when the first international services between Brisbane and Singapore began.\u00a0Qantas pilots first wore a khaki military-style tunic. The uniforms had a nautical style in 1938 before reverting back military style khaki uniforms in WWII (pictured) The crews who flew between Perth and Sri Lanka were over enemy patrolled territory for much of the journey and it was thought that military uniforms would better protect crew if captured. 'The female pilots are also hoping for a more feminine line so I will have that front of mind when I begin the design stage.' Qantas Chief Pilot Richard Tobiano said comfort and durability were important to pilots, who spend up to 16 hours in the cockpit at a time. The new uniforms are expected to be rolled out next year. Mr Grant will take inspiration from historical Qantas uniforms, which have evolved considerably since the 1930s. In the 1950s (pictured) pilots wore nautical-style jackets and trouser with white caps. The uniform for the iconic Australian airline kept a similar design during the 1960s. In this promotional image from 1965 a Qantas pilot can be seen posing with a female passenger. Qantas pilots first wore a khaki military-style tunic when the first international services between Brisbane and Singapore began in 1935. The uniforms took on a more nautical theme before reverting back to a military khaki design during the Second World War. Pilots wore a 'mid-blue' colour in the 1970s, before uniforms became nautical again in 1980. Australian label George Gross and Harry Who designed uniforms featuring a navy jacket and trousers in 1993. The last time the uniform was redesigned was in 2003 by Australian designer Peter Morrisey. In the 1970s a a mid-blue uniform was introduced, reflecting broader style trends of brighter colours at the time. In this black and white photo from the 1970s four Qantas pilots can bee seen organising paperwork. In the 1980s\u00a0Qantas pilot uniforms changed back to the traditional nautical style in 1980. At this time, the first female pilots began flying with Qantas.\n","right_summary":"Melbourne-born designer Martin Grant will refresh Qantas pilot uniforms.

{"document":"A Conservative party candidate has defended photographs which show him trying to lick a female friend's breasts saying they were taken on a night out with friends and show him being a normal, sociable person. Liam Marshall-Ascough is standing to be an MP in Stoke-on-Trent central, which had a 5,500 Labour majority in 2010, and is a traditional Labour stronghold. The candidate, who is gay, is pictured on the open profile of his Facebook page appearing to lick a female friend's breasts. Underneath the picture a friend commented 'drunko'. But Mr Marshall-Ascough has insisted the photos, taken seven years ago, just show him out having fun with close friends 'like a normal person' and do not undermine his ability to do the job. He also said they show he is able to interact with people - important to the role of a politician. Liam Marshall-Ascough, pictured seven years ago on a night out with a close friend, insists the pictures show him enjoying himself like any normal person in their twenties and do not undermine his ability to do the job. 'You are still allowed to go out with your friends,' he told MailOnline. 'I think it's really important that you have a balance. You are not just about politics, but you actually interact with people. 'You can balance your social life and your professional life' Other photographs show him out drinking and posing with several female friends under the title 'more random nights out', and with\u00a0and colleagues at Virgin Atlantic where he works as a steward. Mr Marshall-Ascough is also seen posing with David Cameron and outside the front door of Number 10, in pictures on the site. 'I'm a normal person,' he added in response to claims that some people felt the pictures showed a lack of judgement and responsibility. 'I grew up in a council house and I have a job that's cabin crew. It's a very sociable job and I'm a very sociable person.\u00a0'I think that's important.

'People want politicians these days who are normal people.' Mr Marshall-Ascough is a Conservative candidate for Stoke-on-Trent central, a traditional Labour stronghold. Several photographs show Mr Marshall-Ascough enjoyong nights out with his friends. Mr Marshall-Ascough, now 35, said the pictures had been taken seven years ago when he was out with close friends and was enjoying himself like most people in their twenties. He also added that he is not drinking to excess in any of the pictures, or doing anything wrong. 'I don't hide the fact I'm a normal person, and people want politicians who are normal,' he added. 'I'm definitely not going out at the moment. I'm too busy. 'You have to remember these pictures were taken in my twenties, when I was out like other people. Now I am in my thirties. 'Sometimes you make misjudgements when you are younger and you learn from these and grow up, using these experiences.' Mr Marshall-Ascough said he is able to balance his personal and professional life to interact with people. The Crawley borough councillor hasn't used any privacy settings on his social media profile, so the images are viewable by the public. The 35-year-old has also recently been seen on the campaign trail, supporting other Conservative party candidates.\u00a0He faces a challenge to get elected in his constituency, which has been a Labour stronghold since the 1950s. His female friend, who appears in one of the photos but did not want to be named, said: 'It was taken seven years ago and it was harmless fun. It just happens to be a picture taken out of context. There was nothing untoward. It was all very innocent and Liam is a really professional person.' Mr Marshall-Ascough courted controversy last year when he told his local newspaper that he did not believe there was a cost of living crisis.

He was picked as the Conservative party candidate for Stoke-on Trent in October last year and insisted he will not be standing down as a councillor for Southgate, where he has a seat until 2016.

{"document":"After many years of speculation, Bunkie King has finally laid to rest rumours about the nature of relationship with Australian actor Jack Thompson and her older sister, Leona. Ms King shocked and intrigued the Australian public when she entered into a relationship with Thompson, who was twice her age, while he was also involved with Leona \u2013 who is nicknamed Le. The 60-year-old\u2019s first meeting with Thompson was when she was 15 years old Sydney school girl, and has now revealed the salacious details of their 15-year affair and unconventional arrangement. Scroll down for video. Bunkie King, 60, has revealed how her three-way relationship with Australian actor Jack Thompson and her sister worked. Ms King, also appeared with Thompson in 1975 movie Scobie Malone, had a 15-year affair with the womanising actor. Speaking with A Current Affair about her book, Somebody I Used to Know: Love, Loss and Jack Thompson, Ms King said she decided to pen a novel during an argument with her son. At one point, he shouted: 'I'm not proud that my mother had sex with her sister.' This was the moment Ms King realised there were many misconceptions about her relationship with the womanising actor. 'That really shocked me because that wasn't our relationship,' she said. 'It never entered my head [that's what people thought], so I put it down warts and all.' Ms King, who has two children with her ex-husband, also revealed how she shared one man with her sister, 20. A young Bunkie King pictured here with her sister Leona - nicknamed Le - and Jack Thompson. Le (pictured left) was 20 years old when she started a relationship with the Australian actor. Jack pictured in 1980 (left) and 2013 (right), was written about under the headline 'Jack and his Jills', when he told a newspaper he felt 'like a bone being fought over by two dogs' But from the start the siblings made it clear they were not going to sleep with him in the same bed. When Ms King first moved in with Le and Thompson she was 'allocated one night a week' with the actor. But then they relocated to Collaroy - on Sydney's North Shore - and the sisters would see him on alternating nights. Ms King said she had never close to Le and there were times where she felt her sister, who she is now estranged from, wished she had Thompson all to herself. But it was all or nothing with Thompson, who starred in Spyforce - an action series following Australian Military Intelligence operatives in the South West Pacific during World War II. 'I was happy for whatever crumbs came off the table. It did cause problems with jealousy and things like that. I don't think either of us would have chosen it that way,' Ms King said. Cleo magazine featured him reclined naked on a sofa catapulting him to sex symbol status overnight. Talking to\u00a0New Idea, Ms King said their relationship in many ways was 'quite old-fashioned'. 'We had separate bedrooms. He was just sleeping with both of us,' she said. In her interview with ACA, Ms King said her relationship was not a 'unique situation'. 'It is in western society but it's not a unique situation for a man to have more than one wife,' she said. 'In western society, a man generally speaking has a wife and a mistress or maybe a couple of mistresses.' But despite his commitment to two women, Ms King claims Thompson still had time to be unfaithful to her and Le. She said what hurt her the most about his alleged infidelities was the fact he was not open, honest and upfront about it. Ms King also revealed her sister did not know about her regular afternoon visits from Thompson at their mother's house when he started to court her. The visits in the 1970s increased  to three a week and, after months of spending time together, she fell hopelessly in love knowing he was with Le. Ms King has revealed in her memoirs how, as a virgin, she struggled to dampen her feelings for the blond tanned hunk and desperately craved his love even after her sister caught them kissing. Heyday: The actor, pictured centre (moustache), starred alongside David Bowie (right) in 1983 movie Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence. Seventies hit: The star (right) was catapulted to fame for the series Spyforce,\u00a0based on the adventures of Australian Military Intelligence operatives in the South West Pacific during World War II. Ms King writes: 'One night, he and I are kissing and cuddling in their bedroom when Le [Leona] bursts in the door yelling, \"What the hell are you doing?\" 'He jumps up off the bed and tries to calm her down. I bolt out of the room, down the stairs, through the front door and out into the street. 'I know there's something wrong with what we've been doing. He's obviously Le's boyfriend and I feel bad for her, but I don't know how to give him up.' It was the same for Jack too and, with his popularity at its height in the mid-1970s, the Wake In Fright star bought a rambling farm in the hills above Coffs Harbour, on the NSW mid-north coast, and convinced the sisters to share an 'open' and 'honest' relationship with him. New Idea magazine is on sale now. They moved in together, Ms King confined to the smaller room, while Leona shares the master bedroom with the actor, now dubbed 'Jack The Lady Killer' by the media. In her book, the 60-year-old also speaks frankly about her drug use, ranging from marijuana to acid to heroin. But she did not classify her drug use as 'hardcore'. 'Hardcore to me is someone who is basically mainlining. It was the 60s and the 70s,' Ms King said. During the early years of their relationship, Cleo magazine featured Thompson reclined on a sofa in a pose emulating a classic nude, Titian's Venus d'Urbino, catapulting him to sex symbol status overnight. In 1972, Ms King evealed she fell pregnant for the first time, having forgotten to take the Pill, and underwent the first of three terminations over 15 years. As Jack's fame grew, journalists clamoured for details about the nature of his threesome relationship and in October 1974, he granted Sydney's Daily Telegraph an\u00a0interview.

{"document":"David Cameron's manifesto pledge to dramatically extend Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy was this morning attacked as a 'deeply unfair' bribe which will cost taxpayers billions of pounds. In a bold pitch to working class voters, the Prime Minister said the Tories would offer discounts of up to 70 per cent to  1.3million families in housing association properties to buy their home. But the National Housing Federation said the subsidy - which will be funded by forcing councils to sell off their most expensive properties - will cost taxpayers \u00a35.8billion and was effectively worth \u00a3100,000 to each family who benefited. Scroll down for video. Thatcher's plan: Prime Minister David Cameron will announce an extension of the right-to-buy scheme which will allow all 1.3million families in housing association properties to buy their home. The Chartered Institute of Housing, meanwhile, said the move would do nothing to tackle the housing crisis - and could even make it worse by cutting the number of low-cost social homes available for poor families. Labour jumped on the remarks this morning, claiming the policy had 'unravelled' and pointed to figures showing that last year just 479 council homes were sold off \u2013 raising \u00a3100million, or 2 per cent of the funds promised by the Tories. But the Home Secretary Theresa May\u00a0defended the policy on the BBC this morning \u2013 insisting it was affordable and would give families the opportunity  to live in a home that they owned. She said: 'It is a very important policy because it shows what sort of government a Conservative government would be. It shows that we're a government that's on the side of working people who want to get on a build a better future for themselves and their families.' Unveiling the Conservative manifesto this morning, Mr Cameron declared the 'dream of a property-owning democracy is alive'. He said: 'The next Conservative government will extend the right-to-buy to all housing association tenants in this country \u2013 1.3million extra families \u2013 a new generation given the security of a home of their own.' Original plan: The right-to-buy scheme became Lady Thatcher's most famous single policy. The pledge to extend right-to-buy, which was introduced in 1980 but has now been stopped in its tracks by Labour in Wales and the SNP in Scotland, will delight the Tory faithful, who were buoyed last night by a six-point poll lead over Labour. But the policy was branded 'deeply unfair' by housing associations and industry experts today. National Housing Federation director Ruth Davison said the extension of Right to Buy to housing association properties was 'the wrong solution to our housing crisis'. She said: 'A very conservative estimate of this policy puts the cost to the taxpayer of at least \u00a35.8billion. 'Following 40 years of successive governments' failure to build the homes the country needs, soaring rents and house prices and the biggest baby boom since the 1950s, ensuring that there enough homes today and tomorrow must be our nation's top priority.' She added: 'Halfway through a programme of austerity and in the grips of a housing crisis, if you had \u00a320 billion of taxpayers' money, would you just give it away as a gift to some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents?' Gavin Smart, deputy chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said the move would do nothing to tackle the housing crisis. He said: 'In fact it could make things worse for people on lower incomes who are already struggling to access a decent home at a price they can afford. 'Individual tenants might benefit from the opportunity to own a home, but we would be very concerned that it would result in a dramatic loss of vital social and affordable housing. 'The Conservatives say that forcing councils to sell off their most valuable properties would fund this extension plus 400,000 new homes over five years \u2013 we fear the figures simply won't stack up.' Samantha Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne listen to Prime Minister David Cameron as he unveils the Conservative party manifesto in Swindon this morning. He added: 'And it could have a huge impact on councils' ability to build new homes, particularly in more expensive areas like London and the south east, where it might actually make more sense for them to borrow against the value of these properties so they can fund more homes.' Senior Tory figures, including Iain Duncan Smith, Boris Johnson and David Davis, have been calling for the measure to be at the heart of the party's manifesto. The original right-to-buy saw more than 1.5million council homes being sold off at discounted rates. Leading to a surge in home ownership, it became Lady Thatcher's most famous single policy. Labour's shadow housing minister attacked the Tory policy today. The Coalition government has already increased right-to-buy discounts for council homes, meaning more are moving into the private sector. But most tenants living in homes provided by housing associations \u2013 not-for-profit bodies that have gradually replaced councils as the main providers of social housing \u2013 do not qualify. Enabling them to buy their homes is expected to require major changes to the 1996 Housing Act, and is likely to be fiercely opposed by housing associations themselves. As well as promoting home ownership, the scheme could also dramatically reduce the vast housing benefit bill. Currently, taxpayers subsidise the housing costs of many unemployed and lower paid workers who live in housing association properties. The 1.3million housing association homes are occupied by 2.75million people. Mr Cameron said: 'At the heart of this manifesto is a simple proposition. We are the party of working people, offering you security at every stage of your life. 'If you're a young person looking for training, if you're looking for a decent job, if you want to buy your own home, if you're raising a family and need help with childcare, if you fall ill, and need to rely on our NHS, if you are reaching retirement, and want real security. We are there for you \u2013 offering security at every stage of your life.' Some Labour figures, including former welfare minister Frank Field and former Cabinet minister Alan Milburn, have previously championed the idea of extending the right-to-buy to housing associations. How does right-to-buy work? Introduced in 1980, it gives council house tenants discounts to buy their home. Labour dropped its opposition to the policy but, in 1999, Tony Blair's government cut the top discount from \u00a350,000 to \u00a338,000 and sales slowed. What has the Coalition done? It has sought to reinvigorate the scheme, cutting from five to three the number of years tenants need to have been in a home before they can buy it and upping the discounts to a maximum of \u00a377,000 for most areas. Are housing association tenants covered? Housing associations \u2013 autonomous, not-for-profit bodies that receive public money and loans from the private sector to provide low-cost homes \u2013 are largely exempt. However, around 800,000 HA tenants have a limited 'right to acquire' with discounts capped at between \u00a39,000 to \u00a316,000. The other 500,000 tenants lack any right to buy. What are the Tory proposals? They would legislate to give all housing association tenants full right-to-buy. Tenants in houses would get a 35 per cent discount, increasing by 1 per cent for every extra year they have been a tenant. Those in flats will get a 50 per cent discount, going up 2 per cent every year. Discounts for houses and flats would be capped at the lower of 70 per cent or \u00a3102,700 in London and \u00a377,000 across the rest of England. How will this be paid for? The Tories say they will make councils sell off expensive properties when they become vacant. Council homes that rank in the most costly third of all properties of that type in their area will be sold off. Around 15,000 such properties become vacant each year, because tenants die or move. The sell-off could net \u00a34.5billion a year. What about the proceeds? They will be split, with a proportion used to replace on a 'one-to-one' basis the council homes sold off. The new properties would be more affordable, probably in less expensive locations, and could be built either by a council or housing association. Another slice of the proceeds would be used to fund the new right-to-buy discounts for housing association tenants. The rest would go to create a \u00a31billion fund, enabling councils to bid for cash to develop brownfield land for housing. It would enable them to clean up derelict or contaminated land, and could lead to 400,000 new homes in five years, Tories say.\n","right_summary":"David Cameron announces extension to\u00a0right-to-buy housing policy.

{"document":"Thierry Henry said the Stadium of Light was the noisiest atmosphere he had ever experienced during Sunderland\u2019s derby win over Newcastle. Six days later, silence reigned. A sorrowful silence as thousands streamed for the exits in the wake of Crystal Palace\u2019s fourth goal inside 14 second-half minutes. Sunderland strikers Steven Fletcher and Jermain Defoe can't hide their disappointment following defeat. A shameful silence as Sunderland\u2019s players afterwards absorbed the shock of another embarrassing home collapse. But perhaps most damning was the sad silence of realisation from Dick Advocaat. When asked how concerned he was that the side he has inherited are in danger of the drop, he grimaced for fully 10 seconds before returning: \u2018Worried? Yes, very worried.\u2019 And he has every reason to be. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat looks on as Sunderland are dismantled at home by Crystal Palace. The stands emptied during the second-half at the Stadium of Light as Sunderland conceded four goals. Exactly four weeks earlier Advocaat had watched from the comfort of his home in Holland as Sunderland trailed 4-0 at half-time to Aston Villa, a side who had scored just twice on the road all season. On Saturday, he watched from the discomfort of the touchline as Yannick Bolasie trebled his tally for the campaign with a devastating 11-minute hat-trick. The Congolese forward had earlier laid on the opener for Glenn Murray. Palace were ruthless and Alan Pardew, beaten in his last four Tyne-Wear derbies as Newcastle boss, had his revenge. Yannick Bolasie applauds the travelling fans holding the match ball after helping Crystal Palace to victory. Sunderland (4-3-3): Pantilimon 4.5; Jones 5, Vergini 4, O\u2019Shea 3.5, Van Aanholt 5; Rodwell 5, Cattermole 4.5 (Bridcutt 64min, 5), Gomez 4.5 (Johnson 60, 5); Defoe 5, Fletcher 5, Wickham 6. Subs not used: Reveillere, Graham, Coates, Mannone, Buckley. Scorer: Wickham 89. Booked: Rodwell, Cattermole. Crystal Palace (4-4-2):\u00a0Speroni 6; Ward 6, Dann 7.5, Delaney 6.5, Souare 6 (Kelly 35, 6); Zaha 7.5, McArthur 6.5 (Ledley 69, 6), Jedinak 6.5, Puncheon 7; Bolasie 9 (Sanogo 71, 6), Murray 8. Subs not used: Hangeland, Hennessey, Gayle, Ameobi. Scorers: Murray 48, Bolasie 51, 54, 62. Booked: Dann. Man of the match: Yannick Bolasie. Referee: Anthony Taylor 6. SUPER STAT: Sunderland have now lost the four matches immediately after their Tyne-Wear derby victories. Sunderland, though, had again given a depressing demonstration of how to surrender a football match. When your skipper, John O\u2019Shea, is out-fought for a ball with the odds stacked in his favour \u2014 as he was for Bolasie\u2019s second \u2014 then you know your problems have permeated the core of the team. Jermain Defoe, derby match winner the previous weekend, played as if he had been issued with an exclusion order from the penalty box. Advocaat said: \u2018I can see for myself that we don\u2019t create enough chances even though we play with three strikers. Even when we play with so many up front we don\u2019t create anything and that means there is something wrong in the squad. \u2018We showed we can do something against Newcastle but if we carry on performing like this then we have no chance.\u2019 On this evidence, Advocaat is right. Sunderland will only be spared relegation by the shortcomings of others. They are not capable of saving themselves, as they did in miraculous fashion 12 months ago. Given that the season finishes with trips to Arsenal and Chelsea they are now working on a four-game rescue plan. Wilfired Zaha joins an ecstatic Bolasie (left) after the forward produced a stunning hat-trick in the second-half. For Palace and brilliant Bolasie, meanwhile, they are only looking up after four straight wins. And the 25-year-old credited Pardew following his first senior hat-trick. \u2018That (goals) is what the manager has been demanding from me,\u2019 he said. \u2018He has been putting me right in the middle of sessions, even doing the lay-ups for me. Crystal Palace forward Zaha evades the attention of Sunderland striker Fletcher during the contest. \u2018He has put sessions on that have been especially for the strikers, it\u2019s been excellent.\u2019 Pardew enjoyed seeing his side run riot. Murray headed them in front before Bolasie executed three swift breakaways. A league table from Pardew\u2019s time in charge has Palace fifth. And he added: \u2018We are a pretty young team and only need to add two or three to the squad and we could be a real force next season.\u2019 As for next season for Sunderland, they can only hope they\u2019re in the same division as Palace. Advocaat shakes hands with opposition manager Alan Pardew knowing his side is in real relegation danger.\n","right_summary":"Dick Advocaat warned his side they face relegation if they\u00a0don't\u00a0improve. Sunderland were thumped by Crystal Palace at the Stadium of Light. Blacks Cats boss Advocaat has admitted he is worried by relegation. Sunderland are three points clear of the Premier League relegation zone.\n","hallucinated_summary":"Sunderland lost to Crystal Palace due to the underperformance of John O'Shea, leading to concerns about the team's ability to create chances.

Palace, on the other hand, have won four straight games and are on track to be a top team next season."}
{"document":"A handwritten book containing notes and calculations made by Alan Turing while he worked on decoding Enigma  has been sold at auction for \u00a3700,000. The 56-page document, believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript in existence, was written in 1942 at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire. The notebook, in which he details his work on the foundations of mathematical notation and computer science, was sold for $1,025,000 (\u00a3698,000) in a Fine Books & Manuscripts Sale at Bonhams in New York on Monday. Scroll down for video. Turing (left) wrote the notes at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and they paved the way for computer science. The notes are believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript (right) known to exist, the auctioneer said. A handwritten notebook in which Britain's Enigma machine genius Alan Turing admits he is baffled by an equation could fetch up to $1million (\u00a3690,000). Above, he wrote that the Leibniz notation was 'extremely difficult' Turing is best known for his contribution to cracking the code used by the Germans in their Enigma machines during the Second World War while working at at Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire. He is often said to be the father of modern computing and artificial intelligence. Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game, said:\u00a0'Alan Turing was a war hero, who broke the Enigma code helping to bring an end to World War II, the father of modern computing science, and a gay icon who lived in a time of intolerance and tragically committed suicide as a result. 'His impact on our everyday lives is enormous, and the thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling.' The notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy. Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game (left), said: 'The thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling' Pages of notes show the inner workings of Turing's thoughts as he helped break codes and decipher tests. The 56-page book bought in Cambridge contains Turing's thoughts on the clearly tricky 'Leibniz notation dx\/dy'. 'I find [it] extremely difficult to understand in spite of it having been the one I understood the best once!' he wrote. Gandy gave the papers to The Archive Centre at King's College in Cambridge in 1977. But he kept the notebook, using its blank pages for writing down his dreams at the request of his psychiatrist. Bonham describes Gandy's entries as highly personal; the notebook remained in his possession until he died in 1995. At the beginning of his journal, Gandy writes: 'It seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of Alan's on notation, but possibly a little sinister; a dead father figure, some of whose thoughts I most completely inherited.' Prior to the sale, Andrew Hodges, a leading Turing scholar, said: 'Alan Turing was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value. 'This notebook shines extra light on how, even when he was enmeshed in great world events, he remained committed to free-thinking work in pure mathematics.' The notes, which are highly personal, show Turing working through different equations and considering different results. In some Turing elaborates on his conclusions, writing that one result 'is too subtle and makes an inconvenient definition' But Turing died from cyanide poisoning in 1954, generally thought to have been an act of suicide as a consequence of the hormone treatment he was undergoing as an alternative to imprisonment for his homosexuality. Prime Minister Gordon Brown apologised on behalf of the British Government in 2009 for the way Turing had been treated and he was granted a posthumous pardon in 2013. It will be sold by Bonhams in New York on Monday. It said the seller wished to remain anonymous. Part of the proceeds will be donated to charity. Cassandra Hatton, senior specialist in Fine Books and Manuscripts and the History of Science at Bonhams,\u00a0said: \"This is a wonderful result and a fitting testament to Alan Turing's impact and legacy. 'It has been a great privilege to have been involved in this sale and we are immensely pleased that all the people who bid for this unique item and indeed the wider public have recognised Turing's importance and place in history.' Bonhams said a rare three-rotor German Enigma Enciphering Machine sold at the same auction for a world record price of 269,000 dollars (\u00a3183,000).

{"document":"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)An explosion late Thursday outside a bus station in the northeast Nigerian city of Gombe \u200ekilled at least five people and injured more than a dozen others, witnesses said. The explosion outside the Bauchi Motor Park\u200e happened around 8:30 p.m. after a woman left her explosives-laden handbag near a bus filling up with passengers. The bus was heading to the central Nigerian city of Jos, 125 kilometers away. \"There has been an explosion just outside the motor park and five people have been killed while more than 12 others have been seriously injured,\" said Adamu Saidu, an employee at the bus station. \"Some of the injured have had their limbs blown off\u200e and one of them has had his eye gouged out,\" said Saidu, who was involved in the evacuation of the victims to a hospital. The woman pretended to be going to Jos and lingered around the bus, which was \u200ewaiting to fill up with passengers, according to Falalu Tasiu, a grocer near the bus station. \"The woman kept talking on the phone and dropped her bag beside the bus, pretending to be waiting for the bus to fill up,\" Tasiu said. \"She moved towards shops overlooking the bus station as if she was going to buy something and disappeared. Moments later the bag exploded and set the bus on fire, killing five people and inujuring around 15 others,\" Tasiu said. Although no one has claimed responsibility for the attack, Boko Haram Islamists have repeatedly carried out suicide and bombing attacks on bus stations and markets in Gombe and other northern cities, making the group the main suspect. Boko Haram has in recent months been under sustained pressure from sweeping offensives from a four-nation regional alliance of Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon. The regional offensives have considerably weakened Boko Haram's capabilities, which has prompted the Islamists to resort to attacks on soft targets such as bus stations, markets and schools. The explosion was the first attack since Nigeria held its presidential election at the weekend, which was won by opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari, who vowed to crush Boko Haram when he assumes office in late May.\n","right_summary":"Woman leaves explosives-laden handbag beside bus during boarding.

{"document":"Conviction:\u00a0Amy Wilkinson, 28, left, the granddaughter of former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty,  has admitted falsely claiming almost \u00a318,000 in benefits. The granddaughter of former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty has admitted falsely claiming almost \u00a318,000 in benefits. Amy Wilkinson, 28, claimed\u00a0housing benefit and council tax benefit even though she was living in a home owned by her mother and her partner, who was also working. Wilkinson, who was a British Airways cabin crew attendant, was ordered to pay back a total of \u00a317,604 that she claimed over two years when she appeared at South and East Cheshire Magistrates Court last week. She admitted two charges of dishonestly making false representations in order to claim housing benefit, Council Tax benefit and income support. Magistrates sentenced her to 24 weeks' imprisonment suspended for 24 months and ordered her to pay costs of \u00a3675 and a victim surcharge of \u00a350. Her grandfather, Tommy Docherty, now 86, was manager of Manchester United from 1972 until 1977. He was sacked over his affair with the wife of the team's physio in 1977. Steph Cordon, Cheshire East Council's head of communities, said: 'It is a big mistake for fraudsters to think they can get away with claiming benefits they are not entitled to. 'They risk ending up with a criminal conviction for a serious offence of dishonesty and being ordered to repay the money they have falsely claimed. 'We have a zero-tolerance policy towards benefit fraud because we are determined to ensure that the benefits system works for people who really need help.' Wilkinson of  Knutsford, applied for housing benefit and Council Tax benefit in April 2011, saying that she was on a low income, was living in a privately-rented property and needed assistance with her rent and council tax, a court heard,. Football star:\u00a0Tommy Docherty, now 86, was manager of Manchester United from 1972 until 1977, pictured here after winning the FA Cup in his final year at the club. She also made a claim for income support to help her and her daughter as she had no other income. Fundraising: A pregnant Amy Wilkinson outside Downing Street in 2011 after she raised \u00a310,000 for charity after the death of her son. However, investigators from Cheshire East Council's benefit fraud investigation team and the Department for Work and Pensions found she had failed to declare that her mother owned the property for which she was claiming housing benefit. They also discovered that Wilkinson's partner had joined her household in January 2012 and had been supporting her and the family financially. Over a two-year period, she received a total of \u00a317,604 in state benefits that she was not entitled to. She will have to repay in full the benefits that she fraudulently obtained. In 2011 she raised more than \u00a310,000 for baby charity Tommy's and was thanked by the Chancellor George Osborne, who is also her local MP. She spent 18 months fundraising after she went into labour at 29 weeks and lost her son, Billy John, who tragically only lived for three minutes. Describing why she raised the money she said at the time: 'I was 29 weeks pregnant when I went into labour but they don't know why, there's just no answer for it. I needed something to focus on.

{"document":"An eight-year-old boy who was made an outcast in his village and described by his own family as a 'ticking time bomb' because he has HIV has been given a home at last. In a case that was condemned around the world, Luo Kun Kun was expelled from his village when locals - including his own grandfather - signed a petition to banish him to 'protect villagers' health'. Following that cold-hearted decision, the mournful child explained how, 'nobody plays with me, I play alone'. But now a specialist school in Linfen, a city in southern Shanxi Province, has stepped in to help. The Red Ribbon School is the only school in China equipped to look after and educate HIV-positive children. Kun Kun was refused admission to\u00a0schools and locals would avoid contact with him, so he spent his days playing in the woods alone. The five-year-old has now been admitted a place at the Red Ribbon School in Linfen, China,. After being banished from his village, Kun Kun finally has a home where he is cared for and looked after. Kun Kun contracted the virus from his mother when she was pregnant with him, but was only diagnosed when he was five years old. His mother and stepfather worked in other provinces, so he was raised near the town of Xichong with his non-blood-related grandparents, who had adopted his stepfather as a child. The boy was refused admission to local schools and locals would avoid contact with him, so he spent his days playing in the woods alone. When he was diagnosed, his grandparents found themselves isolated in their village of Shufangya in south-eastern China's Sichuan province\u00a0and so sided with the locals. At a special meeting on December 7 last year, 203 village residents signed a petition asking the authorities to 'carry out preventative isolation measures by taking Kun Kun away from the village, and protect the health of the villagers and children'. It went on to say that Kun Kun 'provokes fear among the community'. He was also referred to as a 'ticking time bomb'. Wang Yishu, party chief of Shufangya village, said: 'The villagers sympathise with him, he is innocent, and only a small child. But his AIDS is too scary for us'. Kun Kun was forced to play alone in his home village, but has now been admitted to a specialist school. The Sichuan government contacted the school in Linfen when Kun Kun's plight made worldwide headlines. However the future is now looking up for Kun Kun, after he was given a place at the boarding school last week. The Sichuan government contacted the school in Linfen when Kun Kun's desperate plight made worldwide headlines. Headteacher Guo Xiaoping said: 'A good social and educational environment is important for Kun Kun and with the help of teachers, he is more open and polite than before'. He added: 'Kun Kun's physical strength is notably below that of the other students. Fortunately, he has been sent here in time, and started taking medication last November. At Kunkun's age, it's crucial that he undergoes proper treatment.' Kun Kun did not say a word when he arrived at the school, according to the headteacher, but can study and talk like a normal student now. The devastating case of Kun Kun has highlighted the stigma attached to the disease in China. The child was forced out of his village when villagers signed a petition asking the authorities to remove him.

{"document":"The parents of a five-year-old transgender boy are sharing their son\u2019s story with the world in a bid to prove that there is no such thing as being \u2018too young\u2019 to identify as transgender. Massachusetts couple Mimi and Joe Lemay's son Jacob wasn't always a boy. The five-year-old was born Mia, the second of three sisters. But from a very early age, Jacob began rejecting his gender. And after years of questioning how to handle his preferences, before finally coming to terms with what their son wanted, the Lemays explained to\u00a0NBC News\u00a0that they decided to let their child assume the identity of a boy. Scroll down for video. Boys will be boys: Mimi and Joe Lemay's five-year-old son Jacob was born a girl named Mia, but the couple has now accepted that their child is a boy. Mimi and Joe began to notice that Jacob was having difficulties when he was a toddler. Then named Mia, he would insist on changing his clothes 10 to 12 times a day, in an attempt to find something he felt comfortable in, before his parents bought him a blue 'doggy sweater' that he wore for six months straight - often over girlier dresses and tutus. The couple assumed they were just raising a tomboy. 'She would take on \"boy\" personas, and just always want to play with boy things,' said Joe. 'Her need to play boy roles, and her need to be seen or spoken to as a boy at home became very persistent,' added Mimi. Then, shortly before he turned three, Jacob declared himself a boy. Happy family: Jacob was born the second of three daughters in the Massachusetts-based Lemay family. Finding the right wardrobe: From a young age, Jacob (R) preferred to wear boy clothes; when his parents still dressed him as a girl, the frustrated toddler would change outfits up to 12 times a day. Mimi said that she  was worried that Jacob's behavior would make it harder for him to build relationships - already, he had trouble relating to his peers - and she hoped her child's desire to be a boy would go away. In the meantime, she and Joe made allowances while Jacob wasn't in public. Home became a 'battleground over gender', Mimi wrote in a letter to Jacob on his fifth birthday, which was published by The Synapse, continuing that they decided to let Jacob cut his hair, wear boy clothes, and assume aspects of his male identity at home. While this made things easier when just family was around - his older sister eventually stopped teasing him about not being a 'real boy' - things were still hard at school, where Jacob didn't engage with his classmates. Jacob's parents explained that their son's behavior wasn't just that of a typical tomboy. Not content to just 'pretend' to be a boy, Jacob, then still called Mia, hated her body and would say things like: 'Why did god make me this way? Why did god make me wrong?' Trying to fit in: While he was still perceived as a girl, Jacob would only open up around his family and had trouble getting along with his peers. Accepting his identity: The Lemays eased into Jacob's transition, slowly allowing him to wear boy clothes, cut his hair short, and refer to himself as a boy at home. Mimi and Joe saw a glimpse of their future on an April 2014 trip to Disney World. They let Jacob wear a Prince Charming costume, and when strangers called him handsome he 'just glowed'. His mother said persistence, consistence, and insistence are the hallmarks of a possibly transgender child - and Jacob was demonstrating all three. In June 2014, the Lemays sat Jacob down and showed him a video about another transgender boy, Ryland Whittington. Tears in her eyes, Mimi told him: 'All we want is for you to be happy, but we need help to understand what will make you happy.' Joe asked Jacob if he wanted to be like Ryland and have everyone know he's a boy. 'I can't,' Jacob told them. 'I have to be Mia at school.' His parents told him that if he wanted to, he could start attending a new school in the fall.\u00a0Jacob was elated, telling them, 'I want to be a boy always.' The Lemays began to let Jacob transition. Playing the prince: On a trip to Disney World last year, Jacob (pictured right with his sister Ella) was thrilled when strangers mistook him for a boy in his Prince Charming Costume. Happy kid: Since transitioning, Jacob has come into his own; he socializes and shows affection more since he has started to feel more like himself. Mimi says she and her husband didn't expect the 'seismic shift' in Jacob's behavior and personality that they experienced, but the boy completely came out of his shell. He immediately became more social, more affectionate, and more interested in picking up hobbies. 'He's just a different person. He's becoming himself,' said Joe. Watching how the change has affected Jacob has allowed his parents to see Jacob as he sees himself. 'I realized he had never really been Mia,' Mimi said. 'That had been a figment of my imagination.' The Lemays hope that coming forward to talk about their experience will help Jacob grow up in a society where there's a better perception of transgender people.\n","right_summary":"Mimi and Joe Lemay of Massachusetts say their son Jacob was never happy as a girl, adding that he has called himself a boy since he was two.

{"document":"A longtime friend of Joni Mitchell has filed a legal petition seeking to be named the singer-songwriter's conservator. Mitchell, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, was taken to UCLA Medical Center a month ago after being found unconscious in her home. She remains at the hospital, according to Leslie Morris' court petition filed April 28. Morris is described as Mitchell's friend of more than 44 years in the legal documents. Whether the folk and jazz singer is conscious remains a matter of some confusion. In her April 28 petition, Morris says Mitchell is unconscious: \"At this time she (Mitchell) remains unconscious and unable to make any responses, and is therefore unable to provide for any of her personal needs.\" But on Mitchell's website, a statement posted the same day that says it was approved by Morris says Mitchell is alert. \"Contrary to rumors circulating on the Internet today, Joni is not in a coma. Joni is still in the hospital -- but she comprehends, she's alert, and she has her full senses. A full recovery is expected. The document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend Leslie Morris the authority -- in the absence of 24-hour doctor care -- to make care decisions for Joni once she leaves the hospital.\" When asked about the discrepancy between statements about Mitchell's health on her website and in the legal filing, her publicist, Alisse Kingsley, responded that \"the website\" was accurate. A doctor's capacity declaration stated that Mitchell will likely be unable, due to her medical condition, to attend any court hearings for the next four to six months.

{"document":"A Wall Street banker raped an Irish student in a 'disgusting, violent attack' because he was determined to have sex on his birthday, a court heard on Wednesday. Jason Lee forced himself on the 20-year-old in a bathroom and told her to 'shut the f*** up' so her friends in the next room would not hear. The assault ended when the girl kneed him in the groin and staggered out in such a \u2018hysterical\u2019 state she was unable to talk. Lee tried to downplay the incident and said it was 'no big deal' and dismissively told the first police officer on the scene: 'We're good, you can go', the court heard. Lee walked hand in hand with his wife Alicia into New York Suffolk County Court on Wednesday. Former Goldman Sachs managing director Jason Lee, 38, faces charges of allegedly raping a 20-year-old Irish woman in the Hamptons in August 2013. The rape allegedly happened when Lee, 38, invited the victim and her friends to party at his rented $33,000-a-month mansion in the Hamptons on Long Island, New York during the summer of 2013. On the first day of the trial, Kerriann Kelly, the Chief of the Major Crime Bureau at Suffolk District Attorney's office, said that Lee and his victim were 'from such different worlds that they might have been from different planets'. She had spent the summer in New York on a J-1 student work visa and was staying with her brother for a night out before flying home to Ireland. Lee was a high flying executive at Goldman Sachs who lives in Manhattan, but Miss Kelly said: 'What you see is not always what you get'. She told the court: 'What you see in the court room this morning is a defendant dressed in a very professional suit, his hair is nicely combed. he is copiously taking notes as I speak. 'That's not the same individual the victim encountered in the early morning of August 20 2013. Not even close. 'What she encountered was a man who wanted one thing and one thing only, and that thing was sex. He used her to get it.' Lee has pleaded not guilty to first-degree rape, sexual misconduct and third-degree assault charges. He could face 25 years in jail if convicted. On Wednesday he walked into Suffolk District Court wearing a dark suit hand in hand with his wife Alicia, who sat in the public gallery. The court was told that Lee and his friend Rene Duncan met the victim and her friends at the trendy Georgica restaurant and lounge in Wainscott on August, 19 2013. The two men were there celebrating Lee's 37th birthday and they invited the Irish group back to his mansion a short distance away. Miss Kelly said that they were having a good time partying the night away, drinking wine and eating pizza they found in the freezer. The victim and her female friend stripped down to their underwear and got in the pool but Lee got completely naked and jumped in after them. Afterwards, around 6am, the victim went into a downstairs bathroom to change, and she 'became aware that Jason Lee was trying to force his way into the bathroom by pushing open the bathroom door,' Miss Kelly said. 'The victim saw him, he was naked, and she thought: \"Is this a joke?\" She pushed back and said: \"What do you think you're doing?\"' Miss Kelly said that the victim pushed so hard she left her fingerprints on the door, but Lee was too strong and forced the door open. As he did so she went flying onto her back, hurting her hip and scratching her leg. Miss Kelly said: 'Now he had her exactly where he wanted her, on the floor, on her back and he climbed on top of her and he held her down.' The victim tried to shove him off but she was unable to. Miss Kelly said: 'She asked him to get off her. She told him: \"No\"'. Lee has denied first-degree rape, sexual misconduct and third-degree assault and could face 25 years in jail if convicted. 'The defendant put his hand over her mouth and held his hand down so hard that the victim tried to bite him but was unable to. 'Then he told her to shut the f*** up, shut the f*** up. 'He didn't want anyone to interrupt what he wanted to do at that time and in that place - on his birthday'. Miss Kelly described how Lee pulled up her dress, pulled down her underwear and raped her. She said: 'He had no regard for her. 'He had no condom and the 37-year-old Jason Lee you see before you here had no regard for the 20-year-old Irish girl who was just visiting (her brother). 'He took advantage of her because he wanted to have sex and because he was going to do whatever he had to do to get it'. Miss Kelly said that the attack only stopped when the victim managed to knee him in the genitals, making him 'back off in pain'. As she waked out of the bathroom the victim was 'hysterical and crying', Miss Kelly said. Miss Kelly said: 'She couldn't say what was wrong to her. Lee was a managing director for Goldman Sachs and works at the investment bank's headquarters at 200 West Street in Lower Manhattan. A representative from the company said he left the firm last year. 'Her brother was upset and said: \"What's happened to my sister? What went on in that room?\"' 'The victim couldn't speak she was so hysterical.' The police were called by Mr Duncan because he thought that his car had been stolen, though the court was told that he had actually loaned it to some of the victim's friends who had left earlier. During the call to the 911 dispatcher Lee allegedly said: 'It's not big deal, there is no problem here, we don't need you to come to this house'. The victim's brother however insisted they come and said: 'There's something wrong with my sister'. Lee was the the first to approach East Hampton police officer Sarah Mortensen when she arrived at the mansion and told her: 'We're good, you can go. We don't need you. We have got this under control'. However the victim's brother also approached her and said that Lee had 'done something to my sister'. The victim then got into the officer's car and recounted her ordeal, at which point she called for backup. During this time Lee disappeared and would not be found for two hours, the court was told. Whilst in hiding he called Mr Duncan numerous times, called two taxis - one of which was turned away by officer Mortensen - and tried to hail an Uber taxi multiple times. He was eventually found in a Range Rover parked in the driveway which had tinted windows 'curled up in the fetal position', Miss Kelly said. When asked by a police officer what he was doing, he said he was 'embarrassed' and 'fell asleep' That night the victim was taken to be examined by a sexual assault nurse who found she had injuries to her vagina. She also had a scratch almost the entire length of her leg, an injury that was consistent with her account of the incident. The house on Clover Leaf Lane in East Hampton, New York, where the sexual assault allegedly occurred. At that point the victim realised that she did not have her dress and could not find it. Search warrants were executed on Lee's rental home but it was nowhere to be found. The court was told that seven months later a private investigator working for Lee delivered it to prosecutors in a box - there was no explanation why or how. In his defence Lee has hired Andrew Lankler, one of the top white collar criminal defense attorneys in New York. In his opening statement Mr Lankler said that the prosecution had been 'rushed' and that there were 'critical inconsistencies in the stories provided by the victim and the witnesses'. He said that the bathroom where the alleged rape happened was 12 feet from where the victim's brother and her friend were but that they did not hear a noise. He said that the facts were 'entirely consistent with the circumstances under which consensual sex occurs' but that it could have been 'perhaps regrettable consensual sex'. Before the allegation of rape the evening had been fun for all concerned and everyone had been taking pictures together, he said. Mr Lankler said: 'This is not a case that involves an allegation of rape in some back alley between people who are completely unknown to each other'. The trial continues.\n","right_summary":"Jason Lee, 38, was arrested in August 2013 after a woman accused him of attacking her at the home he and his wife rented in East Hampton.

{"document":"Garissa, Kenya (CNN)First came the gunshots. Then the footsteps, as Al-Shabaab militants followed her into her dorm room. Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds, until the gunmen called them out. \"(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,\" Cheroitich told CNN. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" The 19-year-old student at Kenya's Garissa University College didn't see what happened next, but she heard more than enough. \"They were shooting everywhere,\" she said. \"I didn't want to open my eyes.\" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. \"I was scared so much,\" she recalled. Cheroitich's survival story, which she recounted to CNN on Saturday, is a rare bright spot in what has been a horrific week in Garissa, a town about 90 miles from the Somali border, and throughout Kenya. It is all due to Al-Shabaab, the Islamist extremist group that is based in Somalia but hasn't confined its terrorism to there -- as evidenced by Thursday's university attack and the 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming as it promised \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nadif Jama, the governor of Garissa county. \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Jama said. \"They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business.\" Jama said the militants were \"bent on nothing but destruction\" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. \"But that is something we need to fight,\" Jama said. Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. \"These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,\" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as any those who supported them. Five arrested in Kenya attack. In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism \"has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people.\" Kenyatta condemned \"corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab.\" \"There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,\" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an \"existential threat to our republic,\" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to \"tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state.\" \"That fight will never change,\" he added. \"Our forefathers bled and died for this nation. And we will do everything to defend our way of life.\" Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack. Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter.

{"document":"The sense of burning injustice cannot be allowed to fester for too long; for all the psychobabble spouted about the strength of a siege mentality, there are few things more self-destructive than a suspicion that even the greatest effort may be undone by outside forces. The good news for Celtic is that they have an immediate opportunity to both vent their frustration and exorcise any sense of helplessness created by Sunday\u2019s controversial Scottish Cup semi-final loss. The bad news? Ronny Deila\u2019s men looked like a tired team by time-up at Hampden. As hard as they may have worked at building exactly the stamina needed for this stage of the season, having to play for some 70 minutes \u2013 including extra time \u2013 with 10 men inevitably left them appearing more than a little leggy. Celtic left back\u00a0Emilo Izaguirre has called on his team-mates to focus their attention on winning the league title. Izaguirre and Celtic team-mates John Guidetti, Nir Bitton and Scott Brown look dejected during semi-final loss. Celtic are currently five points ahead of Aberdeen. As they travel to Dens Park to take on an always-dangerous Dundee, Deila, John Collins and the rest of his backroom team must find a way to lift \u2013 emotionally as much as physically \u2013 players who have seen a rare and historic Treble wrested from their grasp. Emilio Izaguirre, still low but trying to raise his eyes to the remaining challenge of finishing off with a domestic Double, said: \u2018Now the Treble is finished. \u2018We\u2019ll try our best to win the league now - and next season we\u2019ll try to win the Treble. Now it\u2019s finished, everything is finished - and we must try our best to win the league. \u2018It is hard to speak about the game after Inverness have won. It\u2019s in the past and we must now work up the mentality now to win the league. \u2018It is difficult with 10 men in a semi-final. Inverness are hungry and maybe more emotional. They controlled the ball and it was hard for us against 11 men. \u2018To not have a Scottish Cup final to look forward to is so hard. We want to win the Treble but now it\u2019s over. It\u2019s all about winning the league now. \u2018I don\u2019t like to speak about the referee. It happens in football sometimes when bad decisions and good decisions change the game but it\u2019s finished. Inverness won 3-2 and we\u2019ll look to Wednesday. It\u2019s important we move on and work on winning our next game.\u2019 In the aftermath of such a sickening loss, Celtic have no option but to move on and concentrate on beating Dundee, re-establishing their commanding eight-point lead over nominal challengers Aberdeen. What neither Deila nor his players can afford to do, though, is completely ignore some of the lessons learned in defeat by Caley Thistle. Ignoring the obvious pointer about hoping a team umpteen officials can spot a deliberate handball on the line. The way in which Celtic were exposed by Inverness in the game\u2019s *other* crucial moment, Marley Watkins out-pacing and out-muscling Adam Matthews before beating Craig Gordon to the ball, must be of concern. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a goal-bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of Josh Meekings. Virgil van Dijk, scorer of a wonderful opener on Sunday, admitted: \u2018We will look at our own performance, because we lost. \u2018It (the Josh Meekings handball) should be the key moment but the penalty wasn\u2019t given so it\u2019s nothing to talk about right now. We lost and we\u2019re very disappointed. \u2018We gave everything. With 10 men we kept on fighting, we had enough quality to create a goal but unfortunately it wasn\u2019t enough. \u2018It\u2019s very disappointing of course but we need to move on. On Wednesday we play Dundee away. There is a lot of disappointment. Everybody is down but we are professionals and we need to focus on Dundee. \u2018That\u2019s a big game so we need to be ready for that. But first we need to recover.\u2019 Celtic's\u00a0Virgil van Dijk has also urged his team-mates to move on from their recent defeat by Inverness.\n","right_summary":"Emilo Izaguirre has rallied his team-mates ahead of final six league games.

Troy University students Delonte' Martistee, 22, of Georgia and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, of Alabama were charged on Friday with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators relating to the incident that occurred between March 10-12, according to Bay County Sheriff's Office. According to WFSA, it has been confirmed by university officials that both men were suspended, and Martistee, a promising track star, has been removed from the team. The alleged victim  told deputies she thought she had been drugged before the incident and that she was afraid to report it because she could not remember many details,\u00a0Panama City News Herald\u00a0reported. Scroll down for video. Delonte' Martistee, 22, (left) and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, (right) have been charged in connection with the alleged rape after police in Troy, Alabama, found the clip on a cell phone during another investigation. Martistee of Bainbridge, Georgia is a promising track star at Troy University according to officials, but he has since been removed from the team. Calhoun of Mobile, Alabama was suspended from Troy University along with Martistee, university officials confirmed. 'She knows something happened, but she doesn't know what happened,' Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said. Authorities  are still searching for two additional suspects in the case. Friday's charges stem from a video police found where hundreds of people are seen watching the incident without attempting to intervene during the alleged attack on Panama City Beach, authorities claim. The footage was uncovered on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy, Alabama. Alerting the Bay County Sheriff's Office, the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim. McKeithen branded the video the 'most disgusting, sickening thing' and likened the scene to 'wild animals preying on a carcass laying in the woods'. Following the incident that occurred between March 10-12, the men were arrested and charged on Friday and were taken to the Bay County Jail as they await their first appearance. In the video, McKeithen said one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms. The incapacitated young woman is surrounded by several men while seated on a beach chair during the video filmed behind Spinnaker Beach Club. McKeithen told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped. 'This is such a traumatizing event for this girl. No one should have to fear this would happen in Panama City Beach, but it does.' Authorities said hundreds of people walked past but did not stop the attack near\u00a0Spinnaker Beach Club on Panama City Beach, Florida, in broad daylight during a Spring Break party last month. The sheriff's office said it has encountered incidents like this before through leads found on social media. In one video, police said a crowd pours beer on a girl who appears to be incapacitated while a male performs a sexual act on her. And recently, officers took inventory of the guns and drugs recovered during Spring Break this year which included marijuana, MDMA, cocaine, heroin as well as 49 handguns - which increased from nine last year. This most recent alleged sexual attack and the arrests made on Friday have served as a tipping point for the Bay County Sheriff's Office. McKeithen touted laws during Spring Break such as banning drinking on the beach and parking lots as well as clubs not being able to allow non-military people under 21 to enter. He said he will fight to have even more strict Spring Break regulations in the coming year. 'This draws the line in the sand for us,' he said. 'It is not safe for our children on the beach... If you condone this behavior, you should be in jail, as far as I'm concerned.'

{"document":"A measles outbreak that affected more than 130 Californians since December is over, the California Department of Public Health declared Friday. It has been 42 days since the last known case of B3 strain of measles, the equivalent of two successive incubation periods, said Dr. Karen Smith, director of the health department. The department said in its latest update that 131 people came down with the B3 strain, and five who had a different genotype than the outbreak strain. Of the 131 cases, the state was able to obtain the vaccination status for 81 patients. Of the 81, 70% were unvaccinated. \"Prompt investigation of cases, interviewing hundreds of contacts of infected people, vaccinating hundreds of at risk people, and increasing awareness among health care providers about measles, helped to control this outbreak,\" Smith said. The outbreak began with dozens of visitors to two Disney theme parks in the state. The health department said 42 of the cases occurred from December 17-20. Two patients with rashes have been identified in April, but they have a different measles genotype. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website that 19 different strains have been discovered since 1990. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease. It causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash. It can cause deadly health complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis. It  is spread by contact with an infected person through coughing or sneezing. It can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours. CNN's Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this report.\n","right_summary":"Officials say 131 Californians were affected by one strain, five by other strains.

{"document":"The Tories are set to steal Labour\u2019s thunder by unveiling tax breaks for workers on the minimum wage. A text message intended for a senior aide to George Osborne \u2013 but accidentally sent to a newspaper \u2013 yesterday divulged plans for a \u2018tax free minimum wage\u2019. The details are unclear, but it is thought this would mean that those on the minimum wage would be exempt from paying any income tax \u2013 even if its level is raised in future. New plan: The details of George Osborne's leaked plans are unclear, but it is believed to mean that minimum wage earners wouldn' t be paying any income tax. The minimum wage currently stands at \u00a36.50 an hour, rising to \u00a36.70 in October. Labour\u2019s Ed Miliband yesterday pledged that he would help low earners by raising the level above \u00a38 an hour by October 2019. But the Conservatives look set to outflank both Labour and the Lib Dems on the issue of low pay with a firm commitment in their own manifesto, released today. David Cameron said in his speech to the Conservative party conference last year that he wanted to see the threshold for paying income tax \u2013 currently \u00a310,600 \u2013 go up to \u00a312,500 by April 2020. This will take an extra million people out of income tax altogether, while giving 30million workers a tax cut worth \u00a3500 a year. Critique: Danny Alexander said\u00a0Osborne\u2019s spending plans are 'becoming less and less credible' But if Mr Cameron goes further by also raising the minimum wage \u2013 and still keeping everyone on it out of tax \u2013 then that would represent a major giveaway. Tax cuts for the low paid are a priority for the Prime Minister after promising to raise the inheritance tax threshold and the 40p rate of tax for those on higher incomes. A text message from Downing Street intended for the Chancellor\u2019s adviser, Neil O\u2019 Brien, read: \u2018Hi Neil, Have sent you the tax free min wage press notice draft. Rupert asks if you could print for George in no11?\u2019 Rupert refers to Rupert Harrison, the Chancellor\u2019s most senior economic adviser. The text message ended up being sent to a journalist at The Guardian. It is thought that it refers to a guarantee that, every time the minimum wage rises, its recipients would be protected from paying any income tax. Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said it would be another unfunded spending commitment. He added:\u2018George Osborne\u2019s spending plans are becoming less and less credible by the day, and it\u2019s embarrassing. \u2018They now expect the public to believe them when they make unfunded promises with one hand, whilst decimating family budgets and public services with the other.\u2019 Harriet Harman, deputy leader of the Labour party, said: \u2018The Tories are making panicky promises with absolutely no idea how they will pay for them.\u2019 Mr Miliband yesterday brought forward by one year his pledge to increase the minimum wage to \u00a38. He also promised to enforce it more effectively with higher fines for offending firms.\n","right_summary":"Osborne accidentally divulged plans for a \u2018tax free minimum wage\u2019 Could mean minimum wage earners wouldn't be paying any income tax.

{"document":"The BBC has refused to hand over the emails of a deceased woman to her grieving husband, who believes they will prove she was \u2018bullied\u2019 by the Corporation\u2019s management towards the end of her life. Mother-of-two Marie Csaszar, 45, died last September following a ten-year battle with a brain tumour. She had worked for seven years at the BBC\u2019s financial centre in Cardiff as a contracts manager, but according to her husband Paul, she was forced out of the post into another job after drawing attention to management blunders which he says cost licence-fee payers about \u00a3150,000. Whistleblower:\u00a0Marie Csaszar died after a 10-year battle with a brain tumour. Her widower has had a request for her work emails, which he believes will show she was being bullied by bosses, refused by the BBC. Legal experts described the case as \u2018highly unusual\u2019, but predicted that it could be followed by similar claims as digital documents such as emails and social media posts play an increasingly important part in people\u2019s lives. Facebook users in the US have the chance to designate a \u2018legacy contact\u2019 who can take over parts of their account after their death. Mr Csaszar says he believes the BBC failed in its duty of care to his late wife, and the treatment she received from management affected her health. He asked the BBC under the Data Protection Act for copies of his wife\u2019s emails, in the hope they will provide evidence of her \u2018appalling\u2019 treatment by the Corporation, which he has spent months pursuing. However, he was told last month by the BBC that under the Act, personal data is defined as only \u2018data which relates to a living individual\u2019. Despite Mr Csaszar being his wife\u2019s legal next of kin, an email from the BBC \u2013 seen by The Mail on Sunday \u2013 read: \u2018Unfortunately as your wife has sadly passed away it is not possible for you to exercise the right to access her personal data under the Data Protection Act.\u2019 Mr Csaszar said his wife gave evidence to the BBC\u2019s 2013 Respect At Work review that was set up to look into sexism and bullying following the Jimmy Savile scandal. He said it was her evidence which led the chairwoman, Dinah Rose QC, to conclude some senior Corporation staff were viewed as \u2018untouchable\u2019. Details of the individuals who were the subject of Mr Csaszar\u2019s complaint cannot be published for legal reasons but they involve at least one senior manager on a six-figure salary. Last night, self-employed businessman Mr Csaszar, 48, said: \u2018Marie was being hammered from one side to the other towards the end of her life. Nobody stood up and objected. Locked out: The BBC has refused to hand over the work emails of\u00a0Marie Csaszar to her widower Paul. \u2018The treatment which Marie experienced at the hands of the BBC affected her recovery. She was constantly upset and left in tears, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done to deserve being treated like this.\u201d \u2018They didn\u2019t want Marie on the staff because she knew too much about what had gone on. \u2018She would refuse to sign off certain contracts because they didn\u2019t show value for money, but they were signed off anyway. This caused her a great deal of stress.\u2019 Mrs Csaszar underwent intensive treatment for her cancer over several years, which left her suffering with epilepsy. However, she continued to work in her \u00a350,000-a-year post, and raised serious concerns that could have saved licence-fee payers\u2019 money, her husband claims. In a formal grievance procedure with the BBC in 2013, Mrs Csaszar raised a complaint about the closure of a cash office run by an outside contractor. She was advised by the BBC\u2019s legal department that the Corporation was not liable under its contract to pay any money towards redundancy for staff employed by the contractors. But she told her husband that about \u00a335,000 was paid out anyway. Mr Csaszar says he is desperate to see emails referring to his wife and how she was treated following her whistleblowing. He contacted the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, only to be told that the release of the documents was \u2018at the discretion\u2019 of the BBC. Mr Csaszar has raised his request with the BBC Trust, the Corporation\u2019s watchdog, and is considering legal action. A BBC spokesman said: \u2018We were very sorry to hear of Ms Csaszar\u2019s death. A thorough investigation was carried out into her complaint and the outcome was provided to her in July 2013. We have provided this response to her husband.

{"document":"They are proud words but ones spoken with relief coursing through them. They are a mother\u2019s innately, protective words. AP McCoy\u2019s mum. \u2018We are all going to Sandown on Saturday,\u2019 says Claire McCoy. \u2018It will be emotional in one way and relief in another. I\u2019ll be glad and I will be sorry too.

Tony McCoy poses with his mother Claire McCoy at Punchestown racecourse back in 2010. \u2018But in the last few weeks, since he announced his retirement, I have been more nervous. You are thinking please God get out of this without getting hurt.\u2019 If you think Claire McCoy has got her maths wrong - twenty five years? \u2013 think again. There may seem a perfect symmetry in the way McCoy has decided to end his peerless career this weekend when he crowned champion after two decades at the top of his sport. But the timing is even better than it seems. Exactly 25 years ago, the 15-year-old AP left his home in Moneyglass, County Antrim, to head to the respected but strict regime of an apprentice jockey\u2019s life at the stable of Jim Bolger in County Kilkenny. Claire says seeing \u2018Anthony\u2019 leave left her \u2018heartbroken\u2019. McCoy poses with his father Peader and two sisters Rosin and Jane at Limerick racecourse. She admits she still can\u2019t believe her boy stuck it out at Bolger\u2019s academy for four and a half years. But the steely, dogged determination that enabled her son to not just re-write racing\u2019s history books but tear them up and start again was already in evidence. Claire said: \u2018It was 25 years ago this week that he left to go to Jim Bolger\u2019s. He wasn\u2019t even 16. It was a beautiful day, like today, and I was heartbroken. McCoy grits his teeth as the going gets tough during his final visit to Aintree racecourse. A young McCoy dons his silks and saddle as he poses with his father Peader in 1990. \u2018I can assure you there were many tears that day. Kilkenny seemed so far away and it was. The roads weren\u2019t as good as they are now. \u2018Him and his father went with the late (trainer) Billy Rock in his horsebox. They were meeting Jim Bolger\u2019s horsebox. I could hardly wait until his father came home and part of me thought Anthony would maybe not go and come back. \u2018You couldn't do that now \u2013 can you imagine a 15 year-old going away? \u2018We had been down there before and left Anthony for a couple of weeks. I thought, God he will never stay here but he was very determined. A young McCoy leads in Wood Louse following victory at Downpatrick racecourse. Arsenal legend Ian Wright will present AP McCoy with his 20th and final champion jockey\u2019s trophy at Sandown on Saturday. Track officials had been keen to secure someone with a connection to the club that the retiring rider supports. Thierry Henry had been lined up but his Sky employers vetoed an appearance. Another Arsenal name expected at Sandown is Liam Brady, one of McCoy\u2019s heroes from his childhood. \u2018Jim Bolger\u2019s gallops were 1,500ft above sea level \u2013 it was the wilds of Ireland and the most beautiful setting for animals you ever saw in your life but I would not have said that for the apprentices. \u2018They weren\u2019t living in luxury. The horses were living in more luxury than them. \u2018There was one public phone box and maybe 30 of them. It was a tough time. He was there for four and a half years and believe it or not, when he went to England he was was much closer to home.\u2019 Derby winning trainer Bolger is a mellower model these days.

It was a moment captured by Irish photographer Pat Healy. He said: \u2018I knew AP\u2019s father Peadar. He had bred Thumbs Up (winner of the County Hurdle at the 1993 Cheltenham Festival) and I knew him from point-to-points. He asked me would I take a picture because it was his son\u2019s first ride and he might not have many more.\u2019 The prediction turned out to be wrong but only by about 16,500 rides! McCoy pushes Parlour Games into second during his final trip to Aintree racecourse as a jockey. It had been at Rock\u2019s local stable that the McCoy jockey bug had really been born. The young AP spent every hour he could at the stable 11 miles from his home, at one point hitching a lift in a butcher\u2019s van and ultimately cycling to the stable. Much as she tried Claire could not get her son to concentrate on school. She says: \u2018I might as well have tried to persuade a cat \u2013 he was never, ever going to stay at school . He would huff and puff because he didn\u2019t want to go with me fighting with him. McCoy and his mother Claire pose after he announced his impending retirement at Leopardstown. \u2018Him and I fell out and we argued. I threatened to no avail. Mind you, his father didn't help me much. It was two and against one. I wouldn't say Peadar was happy but he wanted to give him the opportunity to be a jockey. \u2018Anthony was very determined. But he stuck it out. He is a very focused man. We speak a lot on the phone \u2013 not about racing, just every day normal things.

{"document":"Lord Stevens is to be investigated over hotly disputed allegations of a cover-up of police corruption in the bungled Step-hen Lawrence murder probe. Last night the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it will investigate claims that the former Met chief failed to hand over key information to the Macpherson Inquiry regarding the black teenager\u2019s race hate killing. The watchdog probe stems from a complaint from Stephen\u2019s father Neville Lawrence. Lord Stevens was deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police from 1998 to 2000 \u2013 while the Macpherson Inquiry report was being compiled \u2013 before serving five years as the UK\u2019s most senior policeman. 'Cover-up':\u00a0Former Met Police commissioner Lord Stevens (left) is to be investigated into allegations of a cover-up over the Stephen Lawrence murder probe in the nineties. Sparked new investigation: Neville Lawrence, the father of murdered Stephen Lawrence, made a complaint last October about the failure of senior officers during the Macpherson Inquiry. The complaint concerns a letter to the Macpherson Inquiry in 1998, in which Lord Stevens stated that no officer or former officer involved in giving evidence was under investigation for corruption. It is alleged that the letter included misleading information. However, last night sources close to the former Scotland Yard commissioner said he was vindicated last year by Mark Ellison QC, the author of an official report into the Lawrence corruption allegations. A source said: \u2018Any suggestion that anyone from the Met would seek to withhold the truth from the Macpherson Inquiry at that time is completely untrue. Last year Mark Ellison wrote to Lord Stevens to say he had done nothing wrong.\u2019 Last night, Channel 4 News \u2013 which revealed details of the IPCC probe into Lord Stevens \u2013 quoted him as saying: \u2018Step very carefully, I\u2019m not putting up with any more c**p about this.\u2019 Quoting from a letter he received from Mr Ellison, Lord Stevens was reported to have said: \u2018No one is suggesting that you did anything that was culpable in any way.\u2019 Baroness Lawrence, pictured taking her seat in the House of Lords in 2013, described undercover police officers as 'disgraceful' following the findings of the Ellison review last year. The IPCC said: \u2018We can confirm we are independently investigating Lord Stevens following a referral from the Metropolitan Police.\u2019 The Met said that after it received \u2018a public complaint in relation to Lord Stevens\u2019 it made a referral to the IPCC last November. The Met\u2019s statement added: \u2018The complaint has been made in relation to Lord Stevens\u2019s role as the then deputy commissioner and disclosure to the Macpherson Inquiry. Facing probe: Lord Stevens pictured in 2001 alongside Neville Lawrence, whose complaint has sparked the latest investigation. \u2018This issue was raised in the Stephen Lawrence Independent Review by Mark Ellison QC, where he concluded there were defects in the level of information that the Metropolitan Police revealed to the inquiry.\u2019 Mr Lawrence had asked the IPCC to look into alleged failures of senior officers, including Lord Stevens, to provide \u2018full, frank and truthful\u2019 information to the inquiry as well as claims that hundreds of files on past major police corruption probes were shredded. He welcomed the IPCC\u2019s decision to investigate, telling Channel 4 News: \u2018I\u2019m hoping that this time they\u2019re going to come back with a result that can help us to get further into the truth of what was happening during the investigation into Stephen\u2019s death.\u2019 It took more than 18 years to bring two of Stephen\u2019s killers \u2013 Gary Dobson and David Norris \u2013 to justice and they were jailed for life in 2012. Also that year, Home Secretary Theresa May commissioned Mr Ellison QC to lead an independent review into whether there was evidence of corruption in the original Lawrence investigation, and whether evidence had been withheld from the Macpherson Inquiry. Last year she told Parliament that there were \u2018serious concerns that\u2026 relevant material which would show corruption has not been revealed because it cannot be found or has been destroyed\u2019. When the Ellison review reported last year it said one former detective, John Davidson, was suspected of corruption in the Lawrence case, in which he had a key role. Mr Davidson has always denied the claims. Long battle for justice: Stephen's mother Doreen, now Baroness Lawrence, and father Neville have been campaigning for more than 20 years. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge meet with Baroness Lawrence, Stephen's mother, at\u00a0the Stephen Lawrence Centre last month. Damning: In his 1999 report William Macpherson accused\u00a0the Met Police of being institutionally racist. In 1998, five years after Stephen Lawrence was murdered in south east London, retired High Court judge Sir William Macpherson was appointed to head an inquiry into the killing. Macpherson led the review into the conduct of the Metropolitan Police during the murder investigation after the police's initial failure to apprehend the black teenager's killers. In his report, published in February 1999, Macpherson accused the Met of being institutionally racist but concluded that police corruption had not thwarted the case. However, he widely criticised the force's handling of the Lawrence case and said police did not carry out the investigation in an appropriate manner. He made over 70 recommendations, including to extend the number of offences classified as racist, make the police subject to greater public control and protect the rights for victims of crime. He also recommended that police forces increase the number of black and Asian officers, prompting the Government to pledge to increase the number of officers from minority ethnic groups from 2,500 to 8,000 by 2009. And he recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence \u2013 something which became the law in 2005 with the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The Macpherson Report was dubbed 'one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in Britain' and credited with improving police attitudes to racism. Jack Straw, who was the Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 during the time of the report, has previously declared that ordering the inquiry was 'the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary'. However, Home Secretary Theresa May expressed concerns in 2012 that evidence may have been withheld from the 1999 inquiry. She commissioned Mark Ellison QC to lead an independent review into whether there was evidence of corruption in the original Lawrence investigation and last year told Parliament that there were 'serious concerns that\u2026relevant material which would show corruption has not been revealed because it cannot be found or has been destroyed.'

{"document":"An Oklahoma jury today convicted a 17-year-old of first-degree murder in the shooting death of an Australian college baseball player who was killed while out for a jog. The Stephens County jury found Chancey Allen Luna guilty in the August 16, 2013, death of Christopher Lane, who was shot in the back while running along a city street in Duncan. The jury recommended that Luna be sentenced to life in prison without parole. Defense attorneys acknowledged that Luna fired the fatal shot from a passing car that he was riding in, but contended that he meant only to scare Lane. Scroll down fro video. Killer look: Chancey Luna (left), 17, is led from the courtroom to the jail in shackles and handcuffs after being convicted in the 2013 shooting death of Australian baseball player Christopher Lane (right) Heading for lockup:\u00a0The jury recommended that Luna be sentenced to life in prison without parole. Belated apology: As he was being led out of the courtroom, Luna told reporters he was 'sorry' Reckless: Luna's defense lawyer contended that the teen meant only to scare Lane when he shot at him from a moving car. 'There was no motive, no plan to kill anyone,' defense attorney Jim Berry said during opening statements. 'This is a reckless action by a 16-year-old child.' The defense had asked that the jury be allowed to consider a second-degree murder conviction, a request that the judge denied earlier Friday. Second-degree murder would have carried a sentence of 10 years to life in prison. Luna did not testify and the defense called just one witness, Luna's mother, Jennifer Luna. In her brief testimony, Jennifer Luna said her son lived with her parents after he was born and that his father is in jail. 'I wasn't there half the time,' she said. She also insisted from the witness stand that her boy would never hurt anyone intentionally. 'If my son did it, it wasn't on purpose. It wasn't meant to be. My son would never intentionally try to hurt somebody at all.' Dressed in a blue button-down shirt and a striped tie, Chancey Luna was stoned-faced when the jurors announced the guilty verdict. Satisfied: Donna Lane, left, the victim's mother, was pleased with the verdict, saying in reference to Luna that the 'naughty boy' will never hurt another family again.

Devastated: Sarah Harper, the girlfriend of the Australian murder victim, arrives for court in the trial of Chancey Luna Friday. Jennifer Luna, Chancey's mother picture din court Friday, testified that her son would never hurt someone intentionally. However, as he was being led in handcuffs and shackles out of the courtroom, the teenager told a swarm of reporters he was 'sorry.' Lane's parents and sister, who had read heartbreaking victim impact statements before the verdict was announced, expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the trial. 'This naughty boy is never going to do this to any other family,' Donna Lane told the media, according to Sydney Morning News. A co-defendant in the case, James 'Bug' Edwards Jr., now 17, testified that he was a passenger in the car when it swerved toward Lane, and Luna fired the shot. Edwards testified as part of a plea agreement in which a first-degree murder charge against him was reduced to being an accessory after the fact. Parents: Donna Lane, pictured left in court Thursday wiped tears from her face when prosecutors showed jurors a photo of the bloody T-shirt her son was wearing.\u00a0Jennifer Luna (right) said her son lived with her parents and she was not there 'half the time' The car's driver, Michael Jones, now 19, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder as part of a plea bargain, but refused to testify for the prosecution. He is serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole. The doctor who performed the autopsy on Lane testified that even immediate medical attention would not have saved his life. 'Apart from a miracle, no,' said Dr. Inas Yacoub, a forensic pathologist with the state medical examiner's office. Yacoub testified that a .22-caliber bullet was recovered from Lane's body. Star-crossed lovers: Luna and his American girlfriend, Sarah Harper, had returned from a trip to Australia just two days before he was gunned down while out jogging. Torn apart: Lane, from Melbourne, Australia, was visiting his girlfriend, Sarah Harper, and her family in Duncan when he was killed. 'Despite being small, it damaged vital structures and caused significant bleeding,' Yacoub told jurors, striking two major blood vessels, puncturing both lungs and breaking two ribs. The victim's mother, Donna Lane, wiped tears from her face when prosecutors showed jurors a photo of the bloody T-shirt her son was wearing. Lane and family members also wept during testimony by witnesses who tried to comfort Lane as he lay dying. Lane, from Melbourne, Australia, was in Oklahoma on a college baseball scholarship. He was a catcher and preparing for his senior year at East Central University in Ada and was visiting his girlfriend and her family in Duncan when he was shot.\n","right_summary":"Oklahoma jury convicted 17-year-old Chancey Allen Luna of first-degree murder in 2013 killing of Christopher Lane.

{"document":"A size 24 woman who spent years gorging on discounted snacks on the supermarket she works at has lost seven stone after ditching the habit. Leanne Kenny, 23, from Northwich, Cheshire, reached almost 20 stone after repeatedly taking home end-of-the-line discounted junk food. The supermarket worker would snack on bumper bars of chocolate, baked goods and fizzy drinks going cheap because of their sell-by dates. Leanne Kenny ballooned to almost 20st after snacking on leftover goods at her place of work, but after ditching the snacks Leanne has lost 7st and now weighs in at 13st. It wasn't until she broke down in a shop changing room when she couldn't squeeze into their largest dress that she finally resolved to lose weight and cut out her unhealthy post-work snacks. Following her strict diet and fitness regime Leanne has shed seven stone and has shrunk down to 13 stone. Leanne says that she had always struggled with her weight but the real problem began after starting her job in the Co-op. Leanne worked as a check out girl at the Co-op and would snack on discounted products every day. Leanne says that she had always struggled with her weight and was teased when she was in school. Leanne says her break through moment came when she was unable to fit into the largest size in a store. 'Even as a child, I was the biggest one among my friends but my weight really became a problem when I started my supermarket job and couldn't resist the discounted treats,' she said. 'I would get teased at high school but I put on such a confident front, laughing off the hurtful comments and plastering myself in makeup just to make myself feel better.' By the age of 16, Leanne was already a size 20 and felt too embarrassed to go out with her friends so she swapped nights out with staying in wearing sweat pants and drinking fizzy drinks. Leanne started her job as a team leader at Co-op in 2010, aged 19, and she began piling on the pounds. By December 2013, she weighed 19st 3lb and went shopping for a new dress but broke down in tears when she couldn't fit into the store's size 24. Leanne said: 'When I started working at Co-op, I found out that lots of food was discounted at the end of the shift. Leanne joined Weight Watchers and took up walking in a bid to shed the weight. 'I couldn't resist the temptation. I would tell myself that I was bringing it home so that the food wouldn't be wasted or would share it between my family but to be honest I would bring home food anyway whether it was cheap or not and it would all be for me.' Aware that she was gaining weight Leanne attempted some weight-loss regimes but she would quickly give up. 'As my weight increased, I did try some diets but I just couldn't stick with any of them. I'd get hungry at work and then couldn't resist the delicious snacks that were on offer. 'My weight soared but I ignored it until I couldn't any longer - and couldn't even fit into a size 24. Leanne, now a size 14, plans to drop a further dress size by the summer. Pictured here in her old work uniform. 'It was the dress incident where something finally clicked in my head. Instead of coming home with a beautiful brand new dress I had to order a frumpy one online from a plus-sized store - I was mortified.' It was this light-bulb moment that finally saw Leanne make a dramatic change to her lifestyle. 'A week later I signed up to my local Weight Watchers. I immediately cut out bread and sugar and focused on walking. Within six months I got into the swing of it and would walk every day - and managed to lose four stone. 'Instead of stocking up on cakes, chocolate and crisps, I opted for fruit, veg and other healthy snacks instead. And I've never felt better.' Leanne says that one of her proudest moments came when she visited a department store and was able to try on clothes. Leanne credits her boyfriend Dan (pictured with her before weight loss) for keeping her motivated. 'I went to Debenhams in April and managed to fit into a pair of size 18 trousers. This time I cried tears of happiness - it was a long way from the last time I was in a high street changing room.' Leanne says that ditching her habit for after work snacks had been tricky but she had found something else to take home instead. 'The hardest thing has been stopping myself taking treats home from work, but I persevered and now take home fruit or vegetables.' Now Leanne is down to a size 14 and regularly visits the gym, running every night and visiting four times a week. She credits her boyfriend of four years Daniel Tittensor for keeping her motivated throughout her weight loss and aims to lose another stone to reach her goal of being a size 12 by the summer. 'In December 2014, I wore a size 14 dress which was a dream come true,' said Leanne. 'It made all the hard work worthwhile. The past year had been the hardest of my life, forcing myself to resist temptations, but now I can finally have bread and chocolate although in moderation.' Leanne added: 'I never thought I would be able to do it. All it takes is a heck of a lot of willpower and dedication. I've kept an old dress and pair of trousers to remind me of how big I once was. I can fit both of my legs in one leg of my old trousers now! 'I have never felt so good and for once I can look in the mirror and feel happy at what I see - no more discounted goods for me.'\n","right_summary":"Leanne Kenny reached 20st after starting work as a check out girl.

Retired engineer, Dave Tyler captured these stunning pictures showing the ferocious activity on the sun's surface during its solar maximum - when the star is at its most active during its 11 year cycle.

Tyler first became interested in astronomy after seeing the first episode of the BBC's Sky at Night in 1957. He said: 'I had always had a casual interest in astronomy ever since the first Sky at Night. 'However, more than a decade later a friend gave me an old Ross 3 inch refractor which I cobbled onto a camera tripod. Here comes the sun: A magnificent picture of the star which dominates our solar system from December 2014. 'With this simple device I was able to look at Saturn, which left me truly amazed. 'Like many other amateurs who have had the same experience, I was instantly launched into a life long passion with the subject. 'I am now very aware of my position in the solar system. The sun is awesome and many people do not even realise it is a star. Through my scopes it is an amazing sight.'

The mascaras, containing natural ingredients like conditioning shea butter and hydrating keratin, are created on site and then wrapped in monogrammed packaging to complete the personalised theme. Co-founder Nina Leykind said: 'It's like the Baskin Robbins of mascara. Getting it right is about the combination. One doesn\u2019t work without the other. 'Even if you have an amazing brush for you, if it\u2019s put together with the wrong formula then it doesn\u2019t work.' Foundation, too, is set to see a surge in personalisation.
